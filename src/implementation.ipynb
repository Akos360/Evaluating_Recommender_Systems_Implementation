In particular, there is still no unique answer to the long-standing question: âWhat is a photon?â In the present essay we of course do not answer this deep question either but illuminate one important aspect of the photon that on ï¬rst sight looks very strange that is the wave-particle dualism. Indeed, according to the quantum theory of radiation the photon is a wave and a particle at the same time and their respective distinct features manifest themselves in countless phenomena. The double-slit experiment with individual photons is one of them. The ultimate goal of our article is to discuss a rather special double-slit experiment based on two entangled photons which seems to show simultaneously the wave and the particle nature of light. Such a behavior which is strictly forbidden by quantum theory and, in particular, by the principle of complementarity makes the photon even stranger. However, a closer look at the details of the light generation reveals that there is no violation of quantum mechanics, and in the words of G. Stein: â. . .suddenly it doesnât look strange at all.â",

Hawksbills are the rarest of the five species of sea turtle that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and their current abundance is only a fraction of historical levels because millions were killed for tortoiseshell (jewelry, combs, brushes, buttons, etc.) during the past 100 years. Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal. In summary, because sea turtles are difficult to study and since some species have been studied more than others, there are significant gaps in the data available by species, as well as by life stage.

         "science during environmental crises through two case studies â the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Sandy. Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known",

Everyone has their own examplesâICMIâs Klein Project is a multilingual collection of contemporary mathematics written for teachers. It would be nice if the pleasure that we get from mathematics imbued the whole of mathematics education, but we know it does not. Why not? How do we manage to take the pleasure out of mathematics? This question underlies all that follows. Let me now return to Ubiratan DâAmbrosio. It is an honour to be following up Ubiratan DâAmbrosioâs thinking, so let me briefly, and with a broad brush-stroke, go over what he was on about. He questioned inequity within mathematics education in a very fundamental way, and gave us some models for working towards creating a fairer world through a mathematics education that really paid attention to social and cultural issues. Many, many people have worked very strongly in this area, and I do not intend to give a summary of the comprehensive work that has been done. In more recent years, Ubiratan DâAmbrosio started to talk about mathematics as a dorsal spine. I want to highlight this metaphor because it is a very nice way of thinking about what has happened. He sees mathematics as the dorsal spine of civilization, the basis of science and technology (DâAmbrosio, 2007, 2015). The trouble is that you may have a spine and skeleton on which an animal may be built, but that animal sometimes turns into a monster rather than a beautiful creature. This has happened within mathematics, and, I would argue, within mathematics education. DâAmbrosio suggests that our essential goals are responsible creativity and ethical citizenship. What he did was highlight the role of mathematics and mathematics education in achieving both of those goals. In other words, he was pointing us to the wider reasons for our work as mathematicians and mathematics educators. But how? How do we do this? What is it I am supposed to do to engender responsible creativity and ethical citizenship? When I walk up the steps and go into my ofï¬ce, what actions will I take? I can presumably do some things in the way I behave, but how do I help to engender appropriate actions in the students that I teach? How are we to build a beautiful creature and not a monster. I think that DâAmbrosioâs essential message is that we should reinstate cultural processes within mathematics education in order to build beautiful creatures. I wish to think about what other things we might do. To develop a basis for making possible actions more explicit I would like to invoke ecological systems theory, which was developed in the context of child development by Urie Bronfenbrenner in 1979, a couple of years after DâAmbrosio introduced the ethnomathematical approach. The two theories have some overlapping principles (Bronfenbrenner, 1992).",

Indeed, according to the quantum theory of radiation the photon is a wave and a particle at the same time and their respective distinct features manifest themselves in countless phenomena. The double-slit experiment with individual photons is one of them. The ultimate goal of our article is to discuss a rather special double-slit experiment based on two entangled photons which seems to show simultaneously the wave and the particle nature of light. Such a behavior which is strictly forbidden by quantum theory and, in particular, by the principle of complementarity makes the photon even stranger. However, a closer look at the details of the light generation reveals that there is no violation of quantum mechanics, and in the words of G. Stein: â. . .suddenly it doesnât look strange at all.â</td>\n",

Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal.

Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known</td>\n",

Everyone has their own examplesâICMIâs Klein Project is a multilingual collection of contemporary mathematics written for teachers. It would be nice if the pleasure that we get from mathematics imbued the whole of mathematics education, but we know it does not. Why not? How do we manage to take the pleasure out of mathematics? This question underlies all that follows. Let me now return to Ubiratan DâAmbrosio. It is an honour to be following up Ubiratan DâAmbrosioâs thinking, so let me briefly, and with a broad brush-stroke, go over what he was on about. He questioned inequity within mathematics education in a very fundamental way, and gave us some models for working towards creating a fairer world through a mathematics education that really paid attention to social and cultural issues. Many, many people have worked very strongly in this area, and I do not intend to give a summary of the comprehensive work that has been done. In more recent years, Ubiratan DâAmbrosio started to talk about mathematics as a dorsal spine. I want to highlight this metaphor because it is a very nice way of thinking about what has happened. He sees mathematics as the dorsal spine of civilization, the basis of science and technology (DâAmbrosio, 2007, 2015). The trouble is that you may have a spine and skeleton on which an animal may be built, but that animal sometimes turns into a monster rather than a beautiful creature. This has happened within mathematics, and, I would argue, within mathematics education. DâAmbrosio suggests that our essential goals are responsible creativity and ethical citizenship. What he did was highlight the role of mathematics and mathematics education in achieving both of those goals. In other words, he was pointing us to the wider reasons for our work as mathematicians and mathematics educators. But how? How do we do this? What is it I am supposed to do to engender responsible creativity and ethical citizenship? When I walk up the steps and go into my ofï¬ce, what actions will I take? I can presumably do some things in the way I behave, but how do I help to engender appropriate actions in the students that I teach? How are we to build a beautiful creature and not a monster. I think that DâAmbrosioâs essential message is that we should reinstate cultural processes within mathematics education in order to build beautiful creatures. I wish to think about what other things we might do. To develop a basis for making possible actions more explicit I would like to invoke ecological systems theory, which was developed in the context of child development by Urie Bronfenbrenner in 1979, a couple of years after DâAmbrosio introduced the ethnomathematical approach. The two theories have some overlapping principles (Bronfenbrenner, 1992).</td>\n",

In particular, there is still no unique answer to the long-standing question: âWhat is a photon?â In the present essay we of course do not answer this deep question either but illuminate one important aspect of the photon that on ï¬rst sight looks very strange that is the wave-particle dualism. Indeed, according to the quantum theory of radiation the photon is a wave and a particle at the same time and their respective distinct features manifest themselves in countless phenomena. The double-slit experiment with individual photons is one of them. The ultimate goal of our article is to discuss a rather special double-slit experiment based on two entangled photons which seems to show simultaneously the wave and the particle nature of light. Such a behavior which is strictly forbidden by quantum theory and, in particular, by the principle of complementarity makes the photon even stranger.

Large numbers of leatherback sea turtles are captured each year in the Gulf as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. Hawksbills are the rarest of the five species of sea turtle that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and their current abundance is only a fraction of historical levels because millions were killed for tortoiseshell (jewelry, combs, brushes, buttons, etc.) during the past 100 years. Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal. In summary, because sea turtles are difficult to study and since some species have been studied more than others, there are significant gaps in the data available by species, as well as by life stage. However, despite the data gaps and limitations associated with selected data sets   \n",

Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known   \n",

Everyone has their own examplesâICMIâs Klein Project is a multilingual collection of contemporary mathematics written for teachers. It would be nice if the pleasure that we get from mathematics imbued the whole of mathematics education, but we know it does not. Why not? How do we manage to take the pleasure out of mathematics? This question underlies all that follows. Let me now return to Ubiratan DâAmbrosio. It is an honour to be following up Ubiratan DâAmbrosioâs thinking, so let me briefly, and with a broad brush-stroke, go over what he was on about. He questioned inequity within mathematics education in a very fundamental way, and gave us some models for working towards creating a fairer world through a mathematics education that really paid attention to social and cultural issues. Many, many people have worked very strongly in this area, and I do not intend to give a summary of the comprehensive work that has been done. In more recent years, Ubiratan DâAmbrosio started to talk about mathematics as a dorsal spine. I want to highlight this metaphor because it is a very nice way of thinking about what has happened. He sees mathematics as the dorsal spine of civilization, the basis of science and technology (DâAmbrosio, 2007, 2015). The trouble is that you may have a spine and skeleton on which an animal may be built, but that animal sometimes turns into a monster rather than a beautiful creature. This has happened within mathematics, and, I would argue, within mathematics education. DâAmbrosio suggests that our essential goals are responsible creativity and ethical citizenship. What he did was highlight the role of mathematics and mathematics education in achieving both of those goals. In other words, he was pointing us to the wider reasons for our work as mathematicians and mathematics educators. But how? How do we do this? What is it I am supposed to do to engender responsible creativity and ethical citizenship? When I walk up the steps and go into my ofï¬ce, what actions will I take? I can presumably do some things in the way I behave, but how do I help to engender appropriate actions in the students that I teach? How are we to build a beautiful creature and not a monster. I think that DâAmbrosioâs essential message is that we should reinstate cultural processes within mathematics education in order to build beautiful creatures. I wish to think about what other things we might do. To develop a basis for making possible actions more explicit I would like to invoke ecological systems theory, which was developed in the context of child development by Urie Bronfenbrenner in 1979, a couple of years after DâAmbrosio introduced the ethnomathematical approach. The two theories have some overlapping principles (Bronfenbrenner, 1992).   \n",

Mortalities from speeding watercraft have been the highest overall source of mortality, but there is some indication that with greater education and enforcement, these are on the wane. Cold stress due to periodic shutdown of power plants used as refuges by manatees has also decreased in recent years, due to concerted human action. Many carcasses are too decomposed for accurate assessments of cause of death, and human causes are probably larger than indicated in Figure 13.61 and Table 13.26.   \n",

In communitybased conservation management, stakeholders from a variety of factions within the community are required to work together to implement effective conservation practices. This often creates unlikely partnerships that bridge normal political, socioeconomic and religious divides.

         "Introduction\n\nThis book is open access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.\n\nThis volume discusses the prospects and evolution of informatics (or computer science), which has become the operating system of our world, and is today seen as the science of the information society. Its artifacts change the world and its methods have an impact on how we think about and perceive the world. Classical computer science is built on the notion of an “abstract” machine, which can be instantiated by software to any concrete problem-solving machine, changing its behavior in response to external and internal states, allowing for self-reflective and “intelligent” behavior. However, current phenomena such as the Web, cyber physical systems or the Internet of Things show us that we might already have gone beyond this idea, exemplifying a metamorphosis from a stand-alone calculator to the global operating system of our society.\n\nThus computer scientists will need to reconsider the foundations of their discipline to realize the full potential of our field. Taking often contradictory developments into consideration, researchers will not be able to tackle specific technological or methodological problems in the future without also a broader reflection on their field.

       "      <td>Introduction\\n\\nThis book is open access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.\\n\\nThis volume discusses the prospects and evolution of informatics (or computer science), which has become the operating system of our world, and is today seen as the science of the information society. Its artifacts change the world and its methods have an impact on how we think about and perceive the world. Classical computer science is built on the notion of an “abstract” machine, which can be instantiated by software to any concrete problem-solving machine, changing its behavior in response to external and internal states, allowing for self-reflective and “intelligent” behavior. However, current phenomena such as the Web, cyber physical systems or the Internet of Things show us that we might already have gone beyond this idea, exemplifying a metamorphosis from a stand-alone calculator to the global operating system of our society.\\n\\nThus computer scientists will need to reconsider the foundations of their discipline to realize the full potential of our field. Taking often contradictory developments into consideration, researchers will not be able to tackle specific technological or methodological problems in the future without also a broader reflection on their field. The papers in this book take a first step forward and reflect on these issues from different perspectives. The broad spectrum of topics includes\\n\\nInformatics: a discipline with a (short) history and a high impact\\nInterdisciplinarity: how to do research\\nEthics: what is our responsibility\\nDiversity: why are there so few women in informatics\\nCombining informatics, history and art: a special contribution.\\nThis book is intended for all informatics researchers, in academia as well as in industry. It is our responsibility – not only as scientists but also as citizens – to make the public aware of the dichotomies and dialectic relationships of computer science.</td>\n",

       "4  Introduction\\n\\nThis book is open access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.\\n\\nThis volume discusses the prospects and evolution of informatics (or computer science), which has become the operating system of our world, and is today seen as the science of the information society. Its artifacts change the world and its methods have an impact on how we think about and perceive the world. Classical computer science is built on the notion of an “abstract” machine, which can be instantiated by software to any concrete problem-solving machine, changing its behavior in response to external and internal states, allowing for self-reflective and “intelligent” behavior. However, current phenomena such as the Web, cyber physical systems or the Internet of Things show us that we might already have gone beyond this idea, exemplifying a metamorphosis from a stand-alone calculator to the global operating system of our society.\\n\\nThus computer scientists will need to reconsider the foundations of their discipline to realize the full potential of our field. Taking often contradictory developments into consideration, researchers will not be able to tackle specific technological or methodological problems in the future without also a broader reflection on their field. The papers in this book take a first step forward and reflect on these issues from different perspectives. The broad spectrum of topics includes\\n\\nInformatics: a discipline with a (short) history and a high impact\\nInterdisciplinarity: how to do research\\nEthics: what is our responsibility\\nDiversity: why are there so few women in informatics\\nCombining informatics, history and art: a special contribution.\\nThis book is intended for all informatics researchers, in academia as well as in industry. It is our responsibility – not only as scientists but also as citizens – to make the public aware of the dichotomies and dialectic relationships of computer science.   \n",

         "Táto knižka je výsledkom doktorandského seminára, ktorý som viedol v akademickom roku 2014/2015. Na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií máme šikovných študentov \nschopných naplniť aj náročné predstavy. Jednou takou predstavou je, aby zo seminára vznikol \nmonotematický výskumný text, ktorý dopracujeme do podoby, pripravenej na tlač. V oblasti \nprogramových a informačných systémov sa takéto štúdie podarilo vydať už niekoľkokrát. Zatiaľ \nčo v prvom zväzku Štúdií sme podchytili seminár venovaný návrhovým vzorom a v druhom se\u0002minár venovaný webovej inteligencii, v treťom sa seminár sústreďoval na podstatu softvérovej \narchitektúry a v štvrtom zväzku sme spracovali témy seminára, venovaného softvérovým paradigmám. Zatiaľ posledný, piaty zväzok sa venuje webovede, vznikajúcej vedeckej disciplíne, \nktorá chce študovať web v rôznych aspektoch.\nTento v poradí už šiesty zväzok sa zameriava na odporúčanie v softvérovom inžinierstve. \nMetódy odporúčania informácií sa intenzívne študovali v predošlých zhruba dvadsiatich rokoch \nnajmä v súvislosti s odporúčaním informácií na webe.

Diskrétna matematika patrí medzi teoretické základy \ninformatiky. Slúži nielen pre rozvoj matematicko-logických schopností študentov, ale aj ako teoretická príprava pre ďalšie „pokročilejšie“ informatické predmety. Pri koncipovaní obsahu tejto prednášky stáli sme pred neľahkou úlohou, čo \nzahrnúť do jej obsahu a čo nie. Pretože táto prednáška substituuje čiastočne aj \nbývalý predmet „Lineárna algebra“, zahrnuli sme z tejto oblasti do učebnice \nv rozsahu dvoch prednášok aj základy lineárnej algebry, teórie matíc a sústav \nlineárnych rovníc spolu s elementárnou teóriou determinantov. \nUčebnica je určená pre študentov prvého ročníka bakalárskeho štúdia, ktorí majú \nzákladné stredoškolské vedomosti z teórie množín, algebry a výrokovej logiky. \nV prednáške sme sa snažili čo najviac vyjsť v ústrety potrebám informatiky, preto \naj oproti časti týkajúcej sa algebry je relatívne uprednostnená diskrétna matematika. Cieľom učebnice je aj rozvinúť u študentov schopnosť rigorózneho matematického myslenia pri riešení a formulovaní problémov informatiky. \nPrvá kapitola sa týka metód matematického dôkazu. Kapitoly 2 až 5 sú venované \nteórii množín a kombinatorike, v 6. a 7. kapitole sa venujeme grupám a boolovskej algebre. Kapitoly 8 až 9 sú venované maticiam, sústavám lineárnych rovníc \na determinantom. Zvyšok učebnice sa v 10. až 13. kapitole venuje teórii grafov \na základným algoritmom a aplikáciám teórie grafov. \nKaždá kapitola je sprevádzaná príkladmi, ktorých riešenie poskytne študentom \nschopnosť dobre sa orientovať v danej problematike. Chceme poďakovať mnohým našim študentom, ktorí nám pomohli nájsť veľa nepríjemných preklepov, \nnepresností a evidentných chýb, a tým prispeli k zvýšeniu kvality tejto učebnice. \nTaktiež sa musíme poďakovať nášmu zosnulému kolegovi prof.

Zatiaľ posledný, piaty zväzok sa venuje webovede, vznikajúcej vedeckej disciplíne, \\nktorá chce študovať web v rôznych aspektoch.\\nTento v poradí už šiesty zväzok sa zameriava na odporúčanie v softvérovom inžinierstve. \\nMetódy odporúčania informácií sa intenzívne študovali v predošlých zhruba dvadsiatich rokoch \\nnajmä v súvislosti s odporúčaním informácií na webe.

       "0                                            Táto knižka je výsledkom doktorandského seminára, ktorý som viedol v akademickom roku 2014/2015. Na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií máme šikovných študentov \\nschopných naplniť aj náročné predstavy. Jednou takou predstavou je, aby zo seminára vznikol \\nmonotematický výskumný text, ktorý dopracujeme do podoby, pripravenej na tlač. V oblasti \\nprogramových a informačných systémov sa takéto štúdie podarilo vydať už niekoľkokrát. Zatiaľ \\nčo v prvom zväzku Štúdií sme podchytili seminár venovaný návrhovým vzorom a v druhom se\u0002minár venovaný webovej inteligencii, v treťom sa seminár sústreďoval na podstatu softvérovej \\narchitektúry a v štvrtom zväzku sme spracovali témy seminára, venovaného softvérovým paradigmám. Zatiaľ posledný, piaty zväzok sa venuje webovede, vznikajúcej vedeckej disciplíne, \\nktorá chce študovať web v rôznych aspektoch.\\nTento v poradí už šiesty zväzok sa zameriava na odporúčanie v softvérovom inžinierstve. \\nMetódy odporúčania informácií sa intenzívne študovali v predošlých zhruba dvadsiatich rokoch \\nnajmä v súvislosti s odporúčaním informácií na webe. V posledných rokoch dochádza k čoraz \\nintenzívnejšiemu uvedomeniu, že tieto alebo podobné metódy môžu byť užitočné aj \\nv softvérovom inžinierstve. Ide najmä o odporúčania, ktoré sa poskytnú softvérovému inžinierovi. Ukázalo sa, že je až prekvapujúco veľa možností, čo by bolo vhodné odporúčať niekomu, kto \\nsa podieľa na vývoji softvéru. Druhou stránkou je pestrosť metód, ako odporúčania robiť. \\nCelú problematiku som rozdelil do trinástich častí medzi študentov seminára. Východiskovým literárnym zdrojom pre štúdium bol monografický zborník [1]. Po prednesení príspevkov \\na diskusii na seminári spracovali autori témy aj písomne. Prvotnú zodpovednosť za kapitoly sme \\nsi podelili takto: Blšták za kapitoly 6 a 7, Bystrický za kapitoly 10 a 12, Frťala za kapitoly 9 a \\n13, Kaššák za kapitoly 1 a 4 , Konôpka za kapitoly 3 a 11, Laurinec za kapitolu 8 a Lóderer za \\nkapitoly 2 a 5. Spomenutý zborník sa ukázal byť v mnohom aj cennou inšpiráciou pri písaní, čo \\ns vďakou priznávame. Autori však preštudovali množstvo ďalšej súčasnej vedeckej literatúry \\no príslušnej problematike, o čom svedčia aj zoznamy literatúry pripojené na koniec každej kapitoly. Vedomosti z nich získané tiež využili pri písaní textu.   \n",

Predstavuje spísane  prednášky  z  predmetu  matematická logika.\\nŠtruktúra tohoto textu je upravená tak, že každá kapitola tvorí jednu prednášku.\\nČitateľovi predkladáme 11 kapitol, čo je podľa našich skúsenosti maximálny možný počet  prednášok,  ktorý sa  dá  stihnúť’  počas  13-týždňového  semestra.  V zlých ”rokoch“  sa  fyzicky  nestihne  odprednášať  ani  11  prednášok.  Vtedy  tento  učebný´\\ntext slúži študentom na samoštúdium, pretože základne vedomosti majú mat’ všetci študenti  rovnaké,  bez  ohľadu na  rok, v  ktorom študovali.\\nPo  obsahovej  stránke  možno  učebnicu  rozdeliť’ na štyri časti.\\n-\\tV prvých troch kapitolách zadeﬁnujeme formuly výrokovej logiky, objasníme si  ich  význam  a  ukážeme,  ako  sa  odvodzujú.  Ukážeme  si  tiež,  že  daným spôsobom  vieme  formulu  odvodiť’ práve vtedy, keď je  vždy  pravdivá.\\n-\\tKapitoly  4  až  6  sú  nadstavbou  prvých  troch.  Opíšeme  si  ďalšie  metódy, pomocou  ktorých  vieme  zistiť’,  či  je  formula  tautológia,  ako  aj  aplikácie výrokovej logiky na  spínacie  a  logické obvody  a  na  neurónové  siete.\\n-\\tĎalšie tri kapitoly sa zaoberajú predikátovou logikou. Tak ako pri výrokovej logike, objasníme si význam formúl predikátovej logiky a metódy ich odvodzovania.  Na  odvodzovanie  formúl  budeme   používať’  sémantické   stromy a  Gentzenovský  (sekventový) kalkulus.\\n-\\tV  posledných  dvoch  kapitolách  sa  zaoberáme  netradičnými  logikami.  Opíšeme  si  základy modálnej  a  viachodnotovej  logiky.   \n",
       "2  Cieľom tejto učebnice je poskytnúť študentom informatiky na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií STU ucelený text k prednáške „Algebra \\na diskrétna matematika“. Diskrétna matematika patrí medzi teoretické základy \\ninformatiky. Slúži nielen pre rozvoj matematicko-logických schopností študentov, ale aj ako teoretická príprava pre ďalšie „pokročilejšie“ informatické predmety. Pri koncipovaní obsahu tejto prednášky stáli sme pred neľahkou úlohou, čo \\nzahrnúť do jej obsahu a čo nie. Pretože táto prednáška substituuje čiastočne aj \\nbývalý predmet „Lineárna algebra“, zahrnuli sme z tejto oblasti do učebnice \\nv rozsahu dvoch prednášok aj základy lineárnej algebry, teórie matíc a sústav \\nlineárnych rovníc spolu s elementárnou teóriou determinantov. \\nUčebnica je určená pre študentov prvého ročníka bakalárskeho štúdia, ktorí majú \\nzákladné stredoškolské vedomosti z teórie množín, algebry a výrokovej logiky. \\nV prednáške sme sa snažili čo najviac vyjsť v ústrety potrebám informatiky, preto \\naj oproti časti týkajúcej sa algebry je relatívne uprednostnená diskrétna matematika. Cieľom učebnice je aj rozvinúť u študentov schopnosť rigorózneho matematického myslenia pri riešení a formulovaní problémov informatiky. \\nPrvá kapitola sa týka metód matematického dôkazu. Kapitoly 2 až 5 sú venované \\nteórii množín a kombinatorike, v 6. a 7. kapitole sa venujeme grupám a boolovskej algebre. Kapitoly 8 až 9 sú venované maticiam, sústavám lineárnych rovníc \\na determinantom. Zvyšok učebnice sa v 10. až 13. kapitole venuje teórii grafov \\na základným algoritmom a aplikáciám teórie grafov. \\nKaždá kapitola je sprevádzaná príkladmi, ktorých riešenie poskytne študentom \\nschopnosť dobre sa orientovať v danej problematike. Chceme poďakovať mnohým našim študentom, ktorí nám pomohli nájsť veľa nepríjemných preklepov, \\nnepresností a evidentných chýb, a tým prispeli k zvýšeniu kvality tejto učebnice. \\nTaktiež sa musíme poďakovať nášmu zosnulému kolegovi prof. Ing. Norbertovi \\nFrištackému, PhD., s ktorým sme sa často radili pri koncipovaní sylabu prednášky. Na jeho radu sme zaradili do prednášky Quinovu a McCluskeyho metódu \\noptimalizácie Boolovej funkcie špecifikujúcej logický obvod. Až pri prednášaní \\ntohto predmetu sme zistili, že táto „aplikačná“ časť diskrétnej matematiky patrí \\nmedzi študentmi k najobľúbenejšej časti predmetu.   \n",

         "In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtueÃ¢ÂÂCandor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really isÃ¢ÂÂshe can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really areÃ¢ÂÂand where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.",

Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the CapitolÃ¢ÂÂa rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before . . . and surprising readers at every turn.",

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. TolkienÃ¢ÂÂs own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

         "Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys had been so mean and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as heÃ¢ÂÂs packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.And strike it does. For in HarryÃ¢ÂÂs second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girlsÃ¢ÂÂ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins Ã¢ÂÂ someone is turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspectsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Harry Potter himself!",
