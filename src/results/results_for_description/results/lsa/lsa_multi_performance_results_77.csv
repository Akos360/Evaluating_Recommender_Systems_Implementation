,,,,,916.0,0.426,,Testament of Youth,"Much of what we know and feel about the First World War we owe to Vera Brittain's elegiac yet unsparing book, which set a standard for memoirists from Martha Gellhorn to Lillian Hellman. Abandoning her studies at Oxford in 1915 to enlist as a nurse in the armed services, Brittain served in London, in Malta, and on the Western Front. By war's end she had lost virtually everyone she loved. Testament of Youth is both a record of what she lived through and an elegy for a vanished generation. Hailed by the Times Literary Supplement as a book that helped Ã¢ÂÂboth form and define the mood of its time,Ã¢ÂÂ it speaks to any generation that has been irrevocably changed by war."

Des Moines couldn't hold him, but it did lure him back. After ten years in England, he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of trim and sunny place where the films of his youth were set. Instead, his search led him to Anywhere, USA; a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by lookalike people with a penchant for synthetic fibres. Travelling around thirty-eight of the lower states - united only in their mind-numbingly dreary uniformity - he discovered a continent that was doubly lost; lost to itself because blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a stranger in his own land.The Lost Continent is a classic of travel literature - hilariously, stomach-achingly funny, yet tinged with heartache - and the book that first staked Bill Bryson's claim as the most beloved writer of his generation."

At various times, and in various emotional disguises, Zenia has insinuated her way into their lives and practically demolished them.

Brave, independent, and a lifelong rebel against her country's conservative, patriarchal society, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was temperamentally made for the job. Her group's name was Alliance, but the Gestapo dubbed it Noah's Ark because its agents used the names of animals as their aliases. Marie-Madeleine's codename was Hedgehog.No other French spy network lasted as long or supplied as much crucial intelligence as Alliance--and as a result, the Gestapo pursued them relentlessly, capturing, torturing, and executing hundreds of its three thousand agents, including her own lover and many of her key spies. Fourcade had to move her headquarters every week, constantly changing her hair color, clothing, and identity, yet was still imprisoned twice by the Nazis. Both times she managed to escape, once by stripping naked and forcing her thin body through the bars of her cell. The mother of two young children, Marie-Madeleine hardly saw them during the war, so entirely engaged was she in her spy network, preferring they live far from her and out of harm's way. In Madame Fourcade's Secret War, Lynne Olson tells the tense, fascinating story of Fourcade and Alliance against the background of the developing war that split France in two and forced its citizens to live side by side with their hated German occupiers."

,,,,,11431.0,0.307,,Economics in One Lesson,"Here is a publishing event: the new Mises Institute edition of the classic book that has taught many millions sound economic thinking. It is a hardbound volume, priced very low thanks to special benefactors, and now available in quantity discounts for distribution to your friends, family, and anyone you meet who needs to understand what economics implies for the society, government, and civilization.Henry Hazlitt wrote this book following his stint at the New York Times as an editorialist. His hope was to reduce the whole teaching of economics to a few principles and explain them in ways that people would never forget. It worked. He relied on some stories by Bastiat and his own impeccable capacity for logical thinking and crystal-clear prose.He was writing under the influence of Mises himself, of course, but he brought his own special gifts to the project. As just one example, this is the book that made the idea of the ""broken window fallacy"" so famous.What thrills us in particular about this new edition is that it is beautiful, it is hardcover, and it is newly typeset for modern readers. It has a full index. It includes a wonderful foreword by Walter Block. It's the right size, shape, and feel Ã¢ÂÂ perfect for making this book central to all educational efforts of the future.This is the book to send to reporters, politicians, pastors, political activists, teachers, or anyone else who needs to know.Professor Block explains that it was this book that turned him on to economics as a science. He believes that it is probably the most important economics book ever written in the sense that it offers the greatest hope to educating everyone about the meaning of the science.Written for the non-academic, it has served as the major antidote to fallacies in the popular press, and has appeared in dozens of languages and printings. It's still the quickest way to learn how to think like an economist. And this is why it has been used in the best classrooms more than sixty years.Many writers have since attempted to beat this book as an introduction, but have never succeeded.

Carefully (and also illegally), he tapped into the main irrigation channel. And so began-though few knew it at the time-the Milagro beanfield war. But like everything else in the dirt-poor town of Milagro, it would be a patchwork war, fought more by tactical retreats than by battlefield victories. Gradually, the small farmers and sheepmen begin to rally to Joe's beanfield as the symbol of their lost rights and their lost lands. And downstate in the capital, the Anglo water barons and power brokers huddle in urgent conference, intent on destroying that symbol before it destroys their multimillion-dollar land-development schemes. The tale of Milagro's rising is wildly comic and lovingly ter, a vivid portrayal of a town that, half-stumbling and partly prodded, gropes its way toward its own stubborn salvation."

Oskar, now a dancer, has moved to Paris where he escapes the 1942 roundup of Jews and arrives in Italy with his young daughter Esme. Isabella remains in Florence where she continues to paint. Until she is called upon by Maestro to forge an old master painting, apparently at the behest of the FÃÂ¼hrer himself, and as a result is seen as a Nazi collaborator by her neighbours.

She looked at him again, as if giving weight and bone to a ghost. 'Lenka, it's me,' he said. 'Josef. Your husband.' During the last moments of calm in prewar Prague, Lenka, a young art student, falls in love with Josef. They marry - but soon, like so many others, they are torn apart by the currents of war. In America Josef becomes a successful obstetrician and raises a family, though he never forgets the wife he thinks died in the camps. But in the Nazi ghetto of Terez??n - and later in Auschwitz - Lenka has survived, relying on her skills as an artist and the memories of a husband she believes she will never see again. Now, decades later, an unexpected encounter in New York brings Lenka and Josef back together. From the comfort of life in Prague before the occupation to the horrors of Nazi Europe, The Lost Wife explores the endurance of first love, the resilience of the human spirit and our capacity to remember."

With the Nazi Party at the height of its power, HitlerÃ¢ÂÂs SS fires up the new crematorium at Auschwitz and the occupying army empties PolandÃ¢ÂÂs towns and cities of their Jewish citizens.

Her real name is never used, and she does not look like anyone else in her family.

She has to deal with murder, rape, snakes, crocodiles and depression, and overcome them all before she finally arrives at the end of the secret.

This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a Ã¢ÂÂsuccessÃ¢ÂÂ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen CoveyÃ¢ÂÂs model fully well, or maybe there are some people who havenÃ¢ÂÂt read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using CoveyÃ¢ÂÂs model, or anyone elseÃ¢ÂÂs model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of CoveyÃ¢ÂÂs ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how CoveyÃ¢ÂÂs book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life"

It's a world in which people visit book binders to rid themselves of painful or treacherous memories. Once their stories have been told and are bound between the pages of a book, the slate is wiped clean and their memories lose the power to hurt or haunt them. After having suffered some sort of mental collapse and no longer able to keep up with his farm chores, Emmett Farmer is sent to the workshop of one such binder to live and work as her apprentice. Leaving behind home and family, Emmett slowly regains his health while learning the binding trade. He is forbidden to enter the locked room where books are stored, so he spends many months marbling end pages, tooling leather book covers, and gilding edges. But his curiosity is piqued by the people who come and go from the inner sanctum, and the arrival of the lordly Lucian Darnay, with whom he senses a connection, changes everything."

Most thieves, of course, steal for profit. John Charles Gilkey steals purely for the love of books. In an attempt to understand him better, journalist Allison Hoover Bartlett plunged herself into the world of book lust and discovered just how dangerous it can be.John Gilkey is an obsessed, unrepentant book thief who has stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of rare books from book fairs, stores, and libraries around the country.

,,,,,8552.0,0.283,,Lost in Translation: A Life in a New Language,"This remarkable book is Eva Hoffman's personal story of her experiences as an emigre who loses and remakes her identity in a new land and translates her sense of self into a new culture and a different language.The condition of exile is an exaggeration of the process of change and loss that many people experience as they grow and mature, leaving behind the innocence of childhood. Eva Hoffman spent her early years in Cracow, among family friends who, like her parents, had escaped the Holocaust and were skeptical of the newly imposed Communist state. Hoffman's parents managed to immigrate to Canada in the 1950s, where Eva was old enough to feel like a stranger--bland food, a quieter life, and schoolmates who hardly knew where Poland was. Still, there were neighbors who knew something of Old World ways, and a piano teacher who was classically Middle European in his neurotic enthusiasm for music. Her true exile came in college in Texas, where she found herself among people who were frightened by and hostile to her foreignness. Later, at Harvard, Hoffman found herself initially alienated by her burgeoning intellectualism; her parents found it difficult to comprehend. Her sense of perpetual otherness was extended by encounters with childhood friends who had escaped Cracow to grow up in Israel, rather than Canada or the United States, and were preoccupied with soldiers, not scholars. Lost in Translation is a moving memoir that takes the specific experience of the exile and humanizes it to such a degree that it becomes relevant to the lives of a wider group of readers."

But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty-nine. Two years earlier, living in a small village in central FranceÃ¢ÂÂwhere she, her husband, and their two small daughters had fled in a vain attempt to elude the NazisÃ¢ÂÂshe'd begun her novel, a luminous portrayal of a human drama in which she herself would become a victim. When she was arrested, she had completed two parts of the epic, the handwritten manuscripts of which were hidden in a suitcase that her daughters would take with them into hiding and eventually into freedom. Sixty-four years later, at long last, we can read NÃÂ©mirovsky's literary masterpiece The first part, ""A Storm in June,"" opens in the chaos of the massive 1940 exodus from Paris on the eve of the Nazi invasion during which several families and individuals are thrown together under circumstances beyond their control. They share nothing but the harsh demands of survivalÃ¢ÂÂsome trying to maintain lives of privilege, others struggling simply to preserve their livesÃ¢ÂÂbut soon, all together, they will be forced to face the awful exigencies of physical and emotional displacement, and the annihilation of the world they know. In the second part, ""Dolce,"" we enter the increasingly complex life of a German-occupied provincial village. Coexisting uneasily with the soldiers billeted among them, the villagersÃ¢ÂÂfrom aristocrats to shopkeepers to peasantsÃ¢ÂÂcope as best they can. Some choose resistance, others collaboration, and as their community is transformed by these acts, the lives of these these men and women reveal nothing less than the very essence of humanity.Suite FranÃÂ§aise is a singularly piercing evocationÃ¢ÂÂat once subtle and severe, deeply compassionate, and fiercely ironicÃ¢ÂÂof life and death in occupied France, and a brilliant, profoundly moving work of art."

In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter. The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna forced him into underpaid work as a laborer. During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery. After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party. In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous Munich ""Beer-hall putsch"" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested. During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf, the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign. In Mein Kampf, Hitler describes his strategy for rebuilding Germany and conquering Europe. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who destabilized world peace and pursued the genocide now known as the Holocaust."

Everyone is happy.Ã¢ÂÂJorie, a debut writer, cleverly creates three versions (third version to be released soon), all exactly the same, until the last chapter where each journey ends dramatically differently in order to cater to various tastes. Ã¢ÂÂYou would think that we all read different books,Ã¢ÂÂ said one of her readers. Ã¢ÂÂWe couldnÃ¢ÂÂt stop comparing notes and wound up switching books so we could all read the other endings!Ã¢ÂÂAnd thatÃ¢ÂÂs when Jorie decides to create a fourth version (not yet released) where she packages all of the endings into one book!

Part Three Cups of Tea, and part Into Thin Air, Grennan's remarkable memoir is at once gripping and inspirational, and it carries us deep into an exotic world that most readers know little about.One Person Can Make a DifferenceIn search of adventure, twenty-nine-year-old Conor Grennan traded his day job for a year-long trip around the globe, a journey that began with a three-month stint volunteering at the Little Princes Children's Home, an orphanage in war-torn Nepal. Conor was initially reluctant to volunteer, unsure whether he had the proper skill, or enough passion, to get involved in a developing country in the middle of a civil war. But he was soon overcome by the herd of rambunctious, resilient children who would challenge and reward him in a way that he had never imagined. When Conor learned the unthinkable truth about their situation, he was stunned: The children were not orphans at all. Child traffickers were promising families in remote villages to protect their children from the civil war - for a huge fee - by taking them to safety. They would then abandon the children far from home, in the chaos of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. For Conor, what began as a footloose adventure becomes a commitment to reunite the children he had grown to love with their families, but this would be no small task. He would risk his life on a journey through the legendary mountains of Nepal, facing the dangers of a bloody civil war and a debilitating injury. Waiting for Conor back in Kathmandu, and hopeful he would make it out before being trapped in by snow, was the woman who would eventually become his wife and share his life's work. Little Princes is a true story of families and children, and what one person is capable of when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. At turns tragic, joyful, and hilarious, Little Princes is a testament to the power of faith and the ability of love to carry us beyond our wildest expectations."

What is the reason behind everything? How should we live? What is the truth? What matters the most? Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education of a child in ancient times had knowledge pertaining to these questions as an integral part. But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm.Ã¢ÂÂThe SojournÃ¢ÂÂ is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why it is the truth. By knowing its true nature and essence, we will see everything in its true grandeur.On including Ã¢ÂÂThe SojournÃ¢ÂÂ in the curriculums, the students will come to know how to conduct their lives in the most effective way. They will find a guiding light in any situation of their lives. On repeated readings, the book will become a part of their subconscious mind and consequently, their second nature. This will give them a meaning and purpose for their lives. Those who have passed their study phase can read the book and implement the principles in their lives. The book will change their perception and will help them find their purpose. They will find the ways to resolve anything, since they will know the reason and true nature of all the existence.Thus, Ã¢ÂÂThe SojournÃ¢ÂÂ is a book that will transform. When read with an open mind, and several times, new thoughts and truths will emerge each time, to ponder over. No matter whatsoever the situation a person may be in; on reading the book with a quiet mind and reflecting upon it, he will find solutions and ways out. With the limited time in our lives, these thirty five pages of poems will become a facilitator in real sense of the word. Therefore, the book is meant for everyone and will make the foundations of all civilizations very strong.Trailers:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6H2rq...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAZeOe..."

In a compelling narrative, Marlantes weaves riveting accounts of his combat experiences with thoughtful analysis, self-examination and his readings -- from Homer to the Mahabharata to Jung. He talks frankly about how he is haunted by the face of the young North Vietnamese soldier he killed at close quarters and how he finally finds a way to make peace with his past. Marlantes discusses the daily contradictions that warriors face in the grind of war, where each battle requires them to take life or spare life, and where they enter a state he likens to the fervor of religious ecstasy.Just as Matterhorn is already being acclaimed as a classic of war literature, What It Is Like To Go To War is set to become required reading for anyone -- soldier or civilian -- interested in this visceral and all too essential part of the human experience."

Both Clive Blake, the poet, and Chris Robbins, the photographer, grew up on Cornish family farms. Their love of Cornwall and the natural environment is self-evident in both the poems and the images. Both have also had to cope with disabilities, but this seems to intensify their creativity rather than hinder it. Adrian Blake, the graphic designer, has used his design skills to sympathetically and very effectively pull the whole thing together. This has ensured that the whole book has a very contemporary and pleasing feel to it. The subject matter is wide and varied, and is by no means limited to Cornwall's borders. Emotions are stretched in all directions, but the Cornish dry-wit, humour and general sense of fun is never far away. Clive's poetry has been described as user-friendly and he has been described as a peoples-poet, since his poetry is very easy to read and understand. Despite this he still manages to convey a very powerful and compelling message. This book does not allow normal conventions to restrict it. The book starts with The End, allows some of its text to slope at gravity defying angles and with the poem Happiless, boasts the shortest published poem in the world.

But as Charles C. Mann now makes clear, archaeologists and anthropologists have spent the last thirty years proving these and many other long-held assumptions wrong.In a book that startles and persuades, Mann reveals how a new generation of researchers equipped with novel scientific techniques came to previously unheard-of conclusions. Among them:Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In 1491 there were probably more people living in the Americas than in Europe.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Certain citiesÃ¢ÂÂsuch as TenochtitlÃÂ¡n, the Aztec capitalÃ¢ÂÂwere far greater in population than any contemporary European city. Furthermore, TenochtitlÃÂ¡n, unlike any capital in Europe at that time, had running water, beautiful botanical gardens, and immaculately clean streets.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians built the great pyramids.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pre-Columbian Indians in Mexico developed corn by a breeding process so sophisticated that the journal Science recently described it as Ã¢ÂÂmanÃ¢ÂÂs first, and perhaps the greatest, feat of genetic engineering.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Amazonian Indians learned how to farm the rain forest without destroying itÃ¢ÂÂa process scientists are studying today in the hope of regaining this lost knowledge.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Native Americans transformed their land so completely that Europeans arrived in a hemisphere already massively Ã¢ÂÂlandscapedÃ¢ÂÂ by human beings.Mann sheds clarifying light on the methods used to arrive at these new visions of the pre-Columbian Americas and how they have affected our understanding of our history and our thinking about the environment. His book is an exciting and learned account of scientific inquiry and revelation."

Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂll never give you any information. How could I, knowing what I know about you?Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂPerhaps thereÃ¢ÂÂs more to me than you realize.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre a hateful monster! What else do I possibly need to know?Ã¢ÂÂ

Aerie regretted her outburst less than a second later. The captain immediately left his chair and came close to her. Instinctively, she pulled back, but the pad behind her did not allow her to go far.

As he drew near, she got a good look at his face; though no longer adorned with the pirateÃ¢ÂÂs wig and beard, she could see he was still masked. The apathy, the cynicism, the playful whimsyÃ¢ÂÂall of it hid a deep crevice of pain inside of him.

The sudden urge to reach out and touch him shot through her. It was quickly followed by alarm and self-disgust.

Ã¢ÂÂFrom your comments, I would assume you have yet to learn a great many things,Ã¢ÂÂ he told her, his voice sharp.

Ã¢ÂÂWhat do you mean by that?Ã¢ÂÂ she asked, boldly meeting his gaze.

Ã¢ÂÂFirst, your name is no small matter,"" he said. ""Destinies can be made and shaped by your name, though whether good or bad, it is up to you.""

He turned away from her abruptly and began pacing by her bed. Aerie listened to his steps resonate with certainty and distinctness, like a military cadence, as she tried to breathe properly.

Ã¢ÂÂSecond,Ã¢ÂÂ he continued, glancing at her from over his shoulder, Ã¢ÂÂDespite what you might think, I am not a monster; merely a man.Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂI hardly see the difference,Ã¢ÂÂ she retorted, still rattled by his presence.

Ã¢ÂÂI would expect that, given your education with the URS. Over the past decade, your beloved Daddy Dictator has managed to ensure your education, rigorous as it is, consists of really only following instructions, repeating the lies they prefer to the truth, and ignoring any logic that would unravel them or undermine their authority.Ã¢ÂÂ

On the eve of a fateful war, New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But CarolineÃ¢ÂÂs world is forever changed when HitlerÃ¢ÂÂs army invades Poland in September 1939Ã¢ÂÂand then sets its sights on France. An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she sinks deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspect neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences. For ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. But, once hired, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power. The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to RavensbrÃÂ¼ck, the notorious female-only Nazi concentration camp. The tragedy and triumph of their stories cross continentsÃ¢ÂÂfrom New York to Paris, and Germany to PolandÃ¢ÂÂcapturing the indomitable pull of compassion to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.

,,,,,12536.0,0.25,,With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,"In his own book, Wartime, Paul Fussell called With the Old Breed ""one of the finest memoirs to emerge from any war."" John Keegan referred to it in The Second World War as ""one of the most arresting documents in war literature."" And Studs Terkel was so fascinated with the story he interviewed its author for his book, ""The Good War."" What has made E.B. Sledge's memoir of his experience fighting in the South Pacific during World War II so devastatingly powerful is its sheer honest simplicity and compassion.Now including a new introduction by Paul Fussell, With the Old Breed presents a stirring, personal account of the vitality and bravery of the Marines in the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa. Born in Mobile, Alabama in 1923 and raised on riding, hunting, fishing, and a respect for history and legendary heroes such as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene Bondurant Sledge (later called ""Sledgehammer"" by his Marine Corps buddies) joined the Marines the year after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and from 1943 to 1946 endured the events recorded in this book. In those years, he passed, often painfully, from innocence to experience.Sledge enlisted out of patriotism, idealism, and youthful courage, but once he landed on the beach at Peleliu, it was purely a struggle for survival. Based on the notes he kept on slips of paper tucked secretly away in his New Testament, he simply and directly recalls those long months, mincing no words and sparing no pain. The reality of battle meant unbearable heat, deafening gunfire, unimaginable brutality and cruelty, the stench of death, and, above all, constant fear. Sledge still has nightmares about ""the bloody, muddy month of May on Okinawa."" But, as he also tellingly reveals, the bonds of friendship formed then will never be severed.Sledge's honesty and compassion for the other marines, even complete strangers, sets him apart as a memoirist of war. Read as sobering history or as high adventure, With the Old Breed is a moving chronicle of action and courage."

Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education of a child in ancient times had knowledge pertaining to these questions as an integral part. But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm. Ã¢ÂÂThe SojournÃ¢ÂÂ is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why it is the truth. By knowing its true nature and essence, we will see everything in its true grandeur.On including Ã¢ÂÂThe SojournÃ¢ÂÂ in the curriculums, the students will come to know how to conduct their lives in the most effective way. They will find a guiding light in any situation of their lives. On repeated readings, the book will become a part of their subconscious mind and consequently, their second nature. This will give them a meaning and purpose for their lives. Those who have passed their study phase can read the book and implement the principles in their lives. The book will change their perception and will help them find their purpose. They will find the ways to resolve anything, since they will know the reason and true nature of all the existence. Thus, Ã¢ÂÂThe SojournÃ¢ÂÂ is a book that will transform. When read with an open mind, and several times, new thoughts and truths will emerge each time, to ponder over. No matter whatsoever the situation a person may be in; on reading the book with a quiet mind and reflecting upon it, he will find solutions and ways out. With the limited time in our lives, these thirty five pages of poems will become a facilitator in real sense of the word. Therefore, the book is meant for everyone and will make the foundations of all civilizations very strong.Trailers:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6H2rq...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAZeOe..."

After the sudden death of her husband, Sheryl Sandberg felt certain that she and her children would never feel pure joy again. Ã¢ÂÂI was in Ã¢ÂÂthe void,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ she writes, Ã¢ÂÂa vast emptiness that fills your heart and lungs and restricts your ability to think or even breathe.Ã¢ÂÂ Her friend Adam Grant, a psychologist at Wharton, told her there are concrete steps people can take to recover and rebound from life-shattering experiences. We are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It is a muscle that everyone can build.Option B combines SherylÃ¢ÂÂs personal insights with AdamÃ¢ÂÂs eye-opening research on finding strength in the face of adversity. Beginning with the gut-wrenching moment when she finds her husband, Dave Goldberg, collapsed on a gym floor, Sheryl opens up her heartÃ¢ÂÂand her journalÃ¢ÂÂto describe the acute grief and isolation she felt in the wake of his death. But Option B goes beyond SherylÃ¢ÂÂs loss to explore how a broad range of people have overcome hardships including illness, job loss, sexual assault, natural disasters, and the violence of war. Their stories reveal the capacity of the human spirit to persevere . . . and to rediscover joy.Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. Even after the most devastating events, it is possible to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives. Option B illuminates how to help others in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead. Two weeks after losing her husband, Sheryl was preparing for a father-child activity. Ã¢ÂÂI want Dave,Ã¢ÂÂ she cried. Her friend replied, Ã¢ÂÂOption A is not available,Ã¢ÂÂ and then promised to help her make the most of Option B.We all live some form of Option B.

In its 25 years, the international development charity and youth empowerment movement impacted lives the world over. Innovation was at its core: while most charities focus on making the world a better place for our children, WE Charity focused on making better children for our world. Founded by the ubiquitous Kielburger brothers, WE Charity operated more like a Silicon Valley start-up than a traditional NGO. From creating stadium-filling events with A-list celebrity ambassadors to building schools, infrastructure, a hospital and even a university at lightning speed, the organization was always full-throttle.Its for-profit partner, ME to WE, filled shelves with socially-conscious products that allowed consumers to track the impact of their spending, invited young people and families to visit and work in communities WE Charity supported, and channelled proceeds back into the charity to make it self-sustaining.Unique and disruptive, WE generated energy, engagement, and accolades. But it also bred misunderstanding and, in some quarters, resentment. With a long history of propelling youth to act in support of myriad causesÃ¢ÂÂmaking Ã¢ÂÂdoing good doable,Ã¢ÂÂ the slogan wentÃ¢ÂÂWE Charity was the ideal candidate to administer the Canada Student Services Grant (CSSG) program. The program, if it had happened, involved matching students within non-profits in a summer in which Covid had stolen most job opportunities. And then, WE Charity in Canada was gone. It didnÃ¢ÂÂt crumble. It crashed. Unwittingly caught in the crosshairs of a partisan fight that reflects the increasing Ã¢ÂÂAmericanizationÃ¢ÂÂ of Canadian politics, WE Charity was forced to shutter its doors in Canada.Once a media darling with politicians of all stripes clamouring to appear at its events, the charity was suddenly a pariah accused (falsely) of a litany of wrongdoings: political cronyism; governance failures; heavy-handed decision-making by executives; lining the pockets of the founders; manipulating children; mistreating donors; racism and international corruption. Many were shocked. Detractors were delighted. Led by fringe commentators, the media quickly piled on. Allies who spoke out were castigated and forced to take cover. But while most Canadians have heard of the so-called Ã¢ÂÂWE Charity ScandalÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂat times forming strong viewsÃ¢ÂÂfew are able to recount the true facts.Misperceptions and confusion have ruled the day. And many of the most important voicesÃ¢ÂÂincluding those of educators and young peopleÃ¢ÂÂhave gone unreported and unheard. In this book, former WE board member and lawyer Tawfiq Rangwala unpacks the evidence and provides the critical context around the headline-grabbing controversies that have shaped the narrative. Drawing on the factual record, his personal experiences inside the organization, and extensive interviews with supporters and critics,Rangwala cuts through the fog and explains what really happened, why it happened, and who should be held to account. The author goes even deeper with insightful, compassionate and heartbreaking interviews with WE supporters, benefactors and the politicians that used the awarding of the contract during the global pandemic crisis to paint a picture of conflicts of interest and special favours by the Prime Minister. The world needs to have a balanced perspective on what this International charity has achieved while coming to terms with how the two founders handled the controversy in front of the cameras during testimony. Along the way, we learn what has been lost and the personal cost to Canadians and people around the world.More than just a story of the rise and fall of an iconic global charity, this is a cautionary tale of the collateral damage that can be levelled by unchecked partisan politics, social media pundits, and sensationalist headlines. In the end, Canadians are left to ponder whether the real Ã¢ÂÂscandalÃ¢ÂÂ is the demise of WE Charity and the values of fair play and due process that most of us hold dear."

That she got into SinegardÃ¢ÂÂthe most elite military school in NikanÃ¢ÂÂwas even more surprising.But surprises arenÃ¢ÂÂt always good.Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly powerÃ¢ÂÂan aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much aliveÃ¢ÂÂand that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .RinÃ¢ÂÂs shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late."

Born in 1905 to a wealthy family in the oil-boom city of Baku, at the edge of the czarist empire, Lev escaped the Russian Revolution in a camel caravan. He found refuge in Germany, where, writing under the names Essad Bey and Kurban Said, his remarkable books about Islam, desert adventures, and global revolution, became celebrated across fascist Europe. His enduring masterpiece, Ali and NinoÃ¢ÂÂa story of love across ethnic and religious boundaries, published on the eve of the HolocaustÃ¢ÂÂis still in print today.But Lev's life grew wilder than his wildest stories. He married an international heiress who had no idea of his true identityÃ¢ÂÂuntil she divorced him in a tabloid scandal. His closest friend in New York, George Sylvester ViereckÃ¢ÂÂalso a friend of both Freud's and Einstein'sÃ¢ÂÂwas arrested as the leading Nazi agent in the United States. Lev was invited to be Mussolini's official biographerÃ¢ÂÂuntil the Fascists discovered his ""true"" identity. Under house arrest in the Amalfi cliff town of Positano, Lev wrote his last bookÃ¢ÂÂdiscovered in a half a dozen notebooks never before read by anyoneÃ¢ÂÂhelped by a mysterious half-German salon hostess, an Algerian weapons-smuggler, and the poet Ezra Pound. Tom Reiss spent five years tracking down secret police records, love letters, diaries, and the deathbed notebooks. Beginning with a yearlong investigation for The New Yorker, he pursued Lev's story across ten countries and found himself caught up in encounters as dramatic and surreal, and sometimes as heartbreaking, as his subject's life. Reiss's quest for the truth buffets him from one weird character to the next: from the last heir of the Ottoman throne to a rock opera-composing baroness in an Austrian castle, to an aging starlet in a Hollywood bungalow full of cats and turtles.As he tracks down the pieces of Lev Nussimbaum's deliberately obscured life, Reiss discovers a series of shadowy worldsÃ¢ÂÂof European pan-Islamists, nihilist assassins, anti-Nazi book smugglers, Baku oil barons, Jewish OrientalistsÃ¢ÂÂthat have also been forgotten. The result is a thoroughly unexpected picture of the twentieth centuryÃ¢ÂÂof the origins of our ideas about race and religious self-definition, and of the roots of modern fanaticism and terrorism. Written with grace and infused with wonder, The Orientalist is an astonishing book."

He explains what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and ponder the mysteries of life.

In this novel, she shares the story of her own life and introduces readers to a diverse and eccentric cast of characters including the Lebanese ÃÂ©migrÃÂ© who befriends her and takes her in; her unfortunate godmother, whose brain is addled by rum and who believes in all the Catholic saints and a few of her own invention; a street urchin who grows into a petty criminal and, later, a leader in the guerrilla struggle; a celebrated transsexual entertainer who instructs her in the ways of the adult world; and a young refugee whose flight from postwar Europe will prove crucial to Eva's fate.As Eva tells her story, Isabel Allende conjures up a whole complex South American nationÃ¢ÂÂthe rich, the poor, the simple, and the sophisticatedÃ¢ÂÂin a novel replete with character and incident, with drama and comedy and history, with battles and passions, rebellions and reunions, a novel that celebrates the power of imagination to create a better world."

It is written with many embedded stories from the A. A. Milne Winnie the Pooh books, both for entertainment and because they serve as tools for explaining Taoism. In the book Piglet is shown to possess great power Ã¢ÂÂ a common interpretation of the word Te, which more commonly means Virtue Ã¢ÂÂ not only because he is small, but also because he has a great heart or, to use a Taoist term, Tz'u. The book goes through the other characters Ã¢ÂÂ Tigger, Owl, Rabbit, Eeyore and Pooh Ã¢ÂÂ to show the various aspects of humanity that Taoism says get in the way of living in harmony with the Tao."

HeÃ¢ÂÂs a man who declares heÃ¢ÂÂs broken, and one who detests the two very things I live for most: God and love. Yet, IÃ¢ÂÂve still fallen completely in love with him because I also see the good, something that no one else ever has. I see a man who is strong, silent, honorable and beautiful. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a man who is now scarred just as badly on the outside of his body as he is on the inside, all because of me. One who endured severe torture in order to save me from what would be the worst thing I will ever experience in my entire life. He is a man I call my dark angel, one who will have my heart until the end of time, even if I can never have his.Cade ~ At fifteen years old I lost the only person that ever mattered to me, and the day I lost my little sister in the most vile way was the exact moment I stopped living and only existed. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs until ten years later, when I walked into an open field in Iraq to hear the most incredible voice I would ever hear in my life. One that rooted me to my spot, and ended up belonging to the most beautiful woman in the world. The only woman to ever make me feel something again, something that I thought was dead inside of me. And no matter how badly I wanted to keep her, I knew I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt. Not with what I have lurking inside of me. ItÃ¢ÂÂs something IÃ¢ÂÂve always kept hidden. That is, until the day I unleashed it on the people who dared to hurt her. It was the one thing that gave me the strength to save us, but it was also the one thing that would remind me of why I could never have her.Now two years later, the one girl I never thought I would ever see again, the one I have spent my days and nights craving like an addict, walks back into my life unexpectedly, giving us both the shock of our lives. And when the time comes that she needs me again, I no longer resist. Before I know it, IÃ¢ÂÂm pulled into a life I thought I could never have, one that scares the shit out of me but itÃ¢ÂÂs one IÃ¢ÂÂm realizing I want. There is just one problem.

A dark prophecy is fulfilled when a member of the Priori is murdered setting loose a chain of events which will ultimately lead the world to a battle which will decide the fate of every human for generations to come.Ã¢ÂÂ ""I cried, i laughed and gasped. There are not many novels that can do that to me so very well done. I loved it and highly recommend it to all my friends and avid readers of fantasy adventure."" Sally Naylor - Smashwords, Jan2016 About the author: In 2008, my eldest brother, father to my niece and nephew, was murdered in cold blood for his strong and successful effort in preventing troubled youth joining violent bikie gangs. He was 26 years old. After this, I was flung into the grips of depression which forced me to place my university studies on hold. To escape my pain and sorrow, I travelled around the world, learning, sharing and growing. Once I emerged from my dark place, I was inspired to dedicate my life to helping those who have gone through trauma. This story is one of the tools in my arsenal. Coupled with my own overcoming and growth, the idea for this book came about after volunteering with survivors of abuse and trauma. Having spoken to and mentored numerous survivors, when discussing inspiration, one commonality stuck out. Amongst all the literature available to us, there was an outstanding absence of a protagonist who had risen from the throngs of real, deep abuse and trauma. Sure most, if not all protagonists, go through some mild forms of trauma and abuse, followed by the catalysing after effects which allow them to overcome and grow into the heroes of the story. However, the antagonists of great literature are subjected to abominable traumas which turn them inevitably into villains. This novel questions why should abominable trauma equals villainous behaviour? What if for once, protagonists turned to heroism through such extreme traumas? This literary trend disheartens those who have been through the unimaginable and have almost lost all hope for a better life. The real world survivors, the heroes of said abominable traumas, who have turned to good rather than evil deserve literary hope and more so, representation. ""As an adult who was abused as a child, i am very grateful for this book and i really wish it existed when i was in my late teens because i could have really used the hopeful message that it gives. even though it brought up some dark memories, I still loved it because it also gave me something good to grasp on to. I have never found any story which uses a person who has gone through what i have gone through as a hero and for that i am very grateful. Thank you very much M F C Assoum for this great book and for putting a smile on my face."" David Fisher, Goodreads, Jan 2016."

It was 1994, and in 100 days more than 800,000 people would be murdered in Rwanda and millions more displaced. Clemantine and her fifteen-year-old sister, Claire, ran and spent the next six years wandering through seven African countries searching for safety--hiding under beds, foraging for food, surviving and fleeing refugee camps, finding unexpected kindness, witnessing unimaginable cruelty. They did not know whether their parents were alive.At age twelve, Clemantine, along with Claire, was granted asylum in the United States--a chance to build a new life. Chicago was disorienting, filled with neon lights, antiseptic smells, endless concrete. Clemantine spoke five languages but almost no English, and had barely gone to school. Many people wanted to help--a family in the North Shore suburbs invited Clemantine to live with them as their daughter. Others saw her only as broken. They thought she needed, and wanted, to be saved. Meanwhile Claire, who had for so long protected and provided for Clemantine, found herself on a very different path, cleaning hotel rooms to support her three children.Raw, urgent, yet disarmingly beautiful, The Girl Who Smiled Beads captures the true costs and aftershocks of war: what is forever lost, what can be repaired, the fragility and importance of memory, the faith that one can learn, again, to love oneself, even with deep scars."

BOOK DESCRIPTION: NOBODY'S HERO is the continuing romantic journey of Adam and Karla, which began in MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY'S ANGEL. Retired Marine Master Sergeant Adam Montague has battled through four combat zones, but now finds himself retreating from Karla Paxton, who has declared war on his heart. With a significant age difference, he feels he should be her guardian and protector, not her lover. But Karla's knack for turning up in his bed at inopportune times is killing his resolve to do the right thing. Karla isn't the young girl he rescued nine years earlierÃ¢ÂÂsomething his body reminds him of every chance it gets. Their age difference is only part of the problem. Fifty-year-old Adam has been a collector of lost and vulnerable souls most of his life, but a secret he has run from for more than three decades has kept him emotionally unable to admit love for anyone. Will Karla be able to break through the defenses around his heart and help him put the ghosts from his past to rest? In her all-out war to get Adam to surrender his heart, will the strong-willed Goth singer offer herself as his submissive and, if so, at what cost to herself?

This groundbreaking book by the most influential philosopher since Sartre compels us to reevaluate our assumptions about all the ensuing reforms in the penal institutions of the West. For as he examines innovations that range from the abolition of torture to the institution of forced labor and the appearance of the modern penitentiary, Michel Foucault suggests that punishment has shifted its focus from the prisoner's body to the soul Ã¢ÂÂ and that our very concern with rehabilitation encourages and refines criminal activity.Lucidly reasoned and deftly marshaling a vast body of research, Discipline and Punish is a genuinely revolutionary book, whose implications extend beyond the prison to the minute power relations of our society."

And to the Nazis, Thule was an icy Eden, birthplace of Nordic Ã¢ÂÂpurity.Ã¢ÂÂ In this exquisitely written narrative, Joanna Kavenna wanders in search of Thule, to Shetland, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, Greenland, and Svalbard, unearthing the philosophers, poets, and explorers who claimed Thule for themselves, from Richard Francis Burton to Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen. Marked by breathtaking snowscapes, haunting literature, and the cold specter of past tragedies, this is a wondrous blend of travel writing and detective work that is impossible to set down. RVIEW: Thule, real or not, is ripe and beguiling material for a literary and geographic adventurer, and Kavenna is formidable on both fronts. . . . Highly cerebral, erudite, refreshing.

Hedged in by her parents' genteel country life, she plans her escape to London. There, she takes up with Innes Kent, a magazine editor who wears duck-egg blue ties and introduces her to the thrilling, underground world of bohemian, post-war Soho. She learns to be a reporter, to know art and artists, to embrace her life fully and with a deep love at the center of it. She creates many lives--all of them unconventional. And when she finds herself pregnant, she doesn't hesitate to have the baby on her own. Later, in present-day London, a young painter named Elina dizzily navigates the first weeks of motherhood. She doesn't recognize herself: she finds herself walking outside with no shoes; she goes to the restaurant for lunch at nine in the morning; she can't recall the small matter of giving birth. But for her boyfriend, Ted, fatherhood is calling up lost memories, with images he cannot place. As Ted's memories become more disconcerting and more frequent, it seems that something might connect these two stories-- these two women-- something that becomes all the more heartbreaking and beautiful as they all hurtle toward its revelation. Here Maggie O'Farrell brings us a spellbinding novel of two women connected across fifty years by art, love, betrayals, secrets, and motherhood. Like her acclaimed The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox, it is a ""breathtaking, heart-breaking creation."" (The Washington Post Book World) and it is a gorgeous inquiry into the ways we make and unmake our lives, who we know ourselves to be, and how even our most accidental legacies connect us."

They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders.Patrick Radden Keefe writes an intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussions."

As artillery echoes in the mountains, thirteen-year-old Matilda and her peers are riveted by the adventures of a young orphan named Pip in a city called London, a city whose contours soon become more real than their own blighted landscape.

It guides readers through the journey in a step by step progression, from ancient prophecies to their final fulfillment. The Message for the Last Days maps out God's intersection of our temporary condition to the eternal.The future is revealed by understanding the past; where history and mystery are intertwined.How can we know what the future holds if we don't understand the past? This question is at the heart of this book as much of modern Christian culture has lost its roots. The crux of the book is derived from consistent biblical interpretation methods to find hard truths about our fate mentioned in the Bible.Topics include answers to these questions:Why is the Christian Church so divided with many different denominations and independent Churches? IsnÃ¢ÂÂt there just one true Church?How did the modern Church get so far removed from early Church beliefs as clearly stated in the New Testament and by the early Church fathers?What are the original prophecies in the Old Testament about the end times and how are they repeated in the New Testament?Does the nation of Israel have anything to do with end times? What is the true meaning of the gospel and salvation?These questions are answered by a thorough examination of various interpretation methods. This book explains six different biblical interpretation options then reveals a unified approach to understanding the Bible.Books and articles by KJ Soze cut across various denomination lines to help find unity and clarity for those who may hold differing interpretations.The Message for the Last Days provides detailed historical research of complex topics, such as end times and the afterlife, then condenses the results into a compact format to save time for those interested in biblical studies. The process is an integration of scriptural references, concordances, topical studies and commentaries into a unique package to help clarify the Bible's message about the future."

Brennan must find herself while learning to live with her family in such foreign but ultimately healing surroundings. After her daughterÃ¢ÂÂs death, Janet lost faith in everything. Apart from a few healing practices of going up and down a hill where Brennan observes an old woman talking to her deceased husband at his gravesite and listening to a local bandÃ¢ÂÂs practice music coming from a shed, all that remained was Nature with its dark woods and simple invitation. We witness Janet in the depth of heartsickness slowly but surely being able to kick up her feet Ã¢ÂÂin a mock Tarantella,Ã¢ÂÂ thus starting a freeing ritual in nature that would not fail her. Her dancing in the woods becomes a Ã¢ÂÂpriestlike task of pure ablutionÃ¢ÂÂ in the world of nature, and this helps her to get rid of her pain She now experiences NatureÃ¢ÂÂs healing power like Wordsworth in his Tintern Abbey.AUTHOR BIOJanet K.

Soon, Edith was taken away to a labor camp, and though she convinced Nazi officials to spare her mother, when she returned home, her mother had been deported. Knowing she would become a hunted woman, Edith tore the yellow star from her clothing and went underground, scavenging for food and searching each night for a safe place to sleep. Her boyfriend, Pepi, proved too terrified to help her, but a Christian friend was not: With the woman's identity papers in hand, Edith fled to Munich. There she met Werner Vetter, a Nazi party member who fell in love with her. And despite her protests and even her eventual confession that she was Jewish, he married her and kept her identity secret.In vivid, wrenching detail, Edith recalls a life of constant, almost paralyzing fear. She tells of German officials who casually questioned the lineage of her parents; of how, when giving birth to her daughter, she refused all painkillers, afraid that in an altered state of mind she might reveal her past; and of how, after her husband was captured by the Russians and sent to Siberia, Edith was bombed out of her house and had to hide in a closet with her daughter while drunken Russians soldiers raped women on the street.Yet despite the risk it posed to her life, Edith Hahn created a remarkable collective record of survival: She saved every set of real and falsified papers, letters she received from her lost love, Pepi, and photographs she managed to take inside labor camps. On exhibit at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., these hundreds of documents form the fabric of an epic story - complex, troubling, and ultimately triumphant."

When Henry dies soon after, she uncovers the long-hidden music manuscript. She becomes determined to discover what it is and to return it to its rightful owner, a journey that will challenge her preconceptions about herself and her familyÃ¢ÂÂs historyÃ¢ÂÂand also offer her an opportunity to finally make peace with the past.In Berlin, Germany, in 1783, amid the cityÃ¢ÂÂs glittering salons where aristocrats and commoners, Christians and Jews, mingle freely despite simmering anti-Semitism, Sara Itzig Levy, a renowned musician, conceals the manuscript of an anti-Jewish cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, an unsettling gift to her from BachÃ¢ÂÂs son, her teacher. This work and its disturbing message will haunt Sara and her family for generations to come.Interweaving the stories of Susanna and Sara, and their families, And After the Fire traverses over two hundred years of history, from the eighteenth century through the Holocaust and into today, seamlessly melding past and present, real and imagined. Lauren BelferÃ¢ÂÂs deeply researched, evocative, and compelling narrative resonates with emotion and immediacy."

Cale never thought the thing that could keep him from ever seeing his wife and daughter again would be a zombie apocalypse. As he and a handful of fellow Soldiers escape their base after a massive zombie attack, becoming deserters in order to survive, he begins the long and unexpected journey home through the harsh terrain of the desert; a barren landscape now swarming with not only undead cannibals, but also the enemy he was originally sent to fight.

Cale is tested beyond his imagination and brought to the brink of insanity as he loses friends while fighting the flesh eating masses. He risks his life for weeks, focused on holding his wife and daughter in his arms again. It seems all hope is lost when he finds himself alone and adrift at sea ... but is hope really lost?

In the midst of this isolated bastion of democratic values, Miguel finds more than a new lifeÃ¢ÂÂ he finds someone to live for.

The two discover a love that war and tragedy can not destroy.History and fiction merge seamlessly in this beautiful novel about the resilience of family, love, and tradition in the face of hardship. The bombing of Guernica was a devastating experiment in total warfare by the German Luftwaffe in the run-up to World War II. For Basques, it was an attack on the soul of their ancient nation; for the world, it was an unprecedented crime against humanity. In his first novel, Boling reintroduces the event and paints his own picture of a people so strong, vibrant, and proud that they are willing to do whatever it takes to protect their values, their country, and their loved ones."

Also available in Spanish as El Nacisista Pasivo Agresivo. Find the answers you are looking for. This book You will see that you are not crazy, that your instincts are correct, and you will learn how to see through covert manipulation and control.The most common description a survivor of this type of relationship will use is crazy-making. The emotional abuse and gaslighting makes you question your own view of reality, and sometimes your own sanity. You will know after reading this book if the person you are with is a covert narcissist, and your experience with them will begin to make sense for the first time.When most people think of a narcissist, they think of someone who is grandiose, obviously self-absorbed, sees themself as superior to others, and throws fits of rage when they don't get their way. But what if the narcissist is one of the nicest people you've ever met? What if they are a great listener, seem to care about others, or are a pillar of the community? What if they are the mother that volunteers at the school, the husband that your friends wish they had, the boss that your co-workers feel so lucky to work for? Parents, spouses, partners, bosses, and friends who are covert narcissists come across as the nicest people. They can be spiritual leaders, therapists, moms who bring over casseroles to needy people, and bosses who everyone loves.A covert narcissist has the same traits of narcissism as the well-known overt type. The difference is when they control and manipulate, when they demean and devalue you, it is done in such a subtle way you don't notice it.This type of narcissism is one of the most damaging forms because the abuse is so hidden and so insidious. You can be in a relationship with a covert narcissist that can last for decades and not realize you are being psychologically and emotionally controlled, manipulated, and abused. There are no visible scars with this form of abuse, and you are usually the only one that experiences their destructive and psychologically debilitating behavior.Living with a covert narcissist drains your spirit and leaves you questioning your own reality.You have been lied to for years, and it is time to finally see the truth of what you have been through, who you really are, and how much you deserve love and happiness."

A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates.

She had fallen in love and moved to Paris to pursue her dream of becoming a war correspondent. The real world she found, however, would take her into a very different kind of conflict zone.It started with an itchÃ¢ÂÂfirst on her feet, then up her legs, like a thousand invisible mosquito bites. Next came the exhaustion, and the six-hour naps that only deepened her fatigue. Then a trip to the doctor and, a few weeks shy of her twenty-third birthday, a diagnosis: leukemia, with a 35 percent chance of survival. Just like that, the life she had imagined for herself had gone up in flames. By the time Jaouad flew home to New York, she had lost her job, her apartment, and her independence. She would spend much of the next four years in a hospital bed, fighting for her life and chronicling the saga in a column for The New York Times.When Jaouad finally walked out of the cancer wardÃ¢ÂÂafter three and a half years of chemo, a clinical trial, and a bone marrow transplantÃ¢ÂÂshe was, according to the doctors, cured. But as she would soon learn, a cure is not where the work of healing ends; itÃ¢ÂÂs where it begins. She had spent the past 1,500 days in desperate pursuit of one goalÃ¢ÂÂto survive. And now that sheÃ¢ÂÂd done so, she realized that she had no idea how to live.How would she reenter the world and live again? How could she reclaim what had been lost? Jaouad embarkedÃ¢ÂÂwith her new best friend, Oscar, a scruffy terrier muttÃ¢ÂÂon a 100-day, 15,000-mile road trip across the country. She set out to meet some of the strangers who had written to her during her years in the hospital: a teenage girl in Florida also recovering from cancer; a teacher in California grieving the death of her son; a death-row inmate in Texas whoÃ¢ÂÂd spent his own years confined to a room. What she learned on this trip is that the divide between sick and well is porous, that the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms throughout our lives. Between Two Kingdoms is a profound chronicle of survivorship and a fierce, tender, and inspiring exploration of what it means to begin again."

Scaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It...and Why the Rest Don't is the first major revision of this business classic. In Scaling Up, Harnish and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture. This book is written so everyone -- from frontline employees to senior executives -- can get aligned in contributing to the growth of a firm. There's no reason to do it alone, yet many top leaders feel like they are the ones dragging the rest of the organization up the S-curve of growth. The goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into wind at your back -- creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing; and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, Scaling Up focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. The book includes a series of new one-page tools including the updated One-Page Strategic Plan and the Rockefeller Habits ChecklistTM, which more than 40,000 firms around the globe have used to scale their companies successfully -- many to $1 billion and beyond. Running a business is ultimately about freedom. Scaling Up shows business leaders how to get their organizations moving in sync to create something significant and enjoy the ride."

Galileo's Daughter also presents a stunning portrait of a person hitherto lost to history, described by her father as ""a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness, and most tenderly attached to me."" The son of a musician, Galileo Gahlei (1564-1642) tried at first to enter a monastery before engaging the skills that made him the foremost scientist of his day. Though he never left Italy, his inventions and discoveries were heralded around the world. Most sensationally, his telescopes allowed him to reveal a new reality in the heavens and to reinforce the astounding argument that the Earth moves around the Sun. For this belief, he was brought before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, accused of heresy, and forced to spend his last years under house arrest. Of Galileo's three illegitimate children, the eldest best mirrored his own brilliance, industry, and sensibility, and by virtue of these qualities became his confidante. Born Virginia in 1600, she was thirteen when Galileo placed her in a convent near him in Florence, where she took the most appropriate name of Suor Maria Celeste. Her loving support, which Galileo repaid in kind, proved to be her father's greatest source of strength throughout his most productive and tumultuous years. Her presence, through letters which Sobel has translated from their original Italian and masterfully woven into the narrative, graces her father's life now as it did then. Galileo's Daughter dramatically recolors the personality and accomplishment of a mythic figure whose seventeenth-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science and religion. Moving between Galileo's grand public life and Maria Celeste's sequestered world, Sobel illuminates the Florence of the Medicis and the papal court in Rome during the pivotal era when humanity's perception of its place in the cosmos was being overturned. In that same time, while the bubonic plague wreaked its terrible devastation and the Thirty Years' War tipped fortunes across Europe, one man sought to reconcile the Heaven he revered as a good Catholic with the heavens he revealed through his telescope. With all the human drama and scientific adventure that distinguished Longitude, Galileo's Daughter is an unforgettable story."

Ã¢ÂÂRomÃÂ©o DallaireIn conflicts around the world, there is an increasingly popular weapon system that requires negligible technology, is simple to sustain, has unlimited versatility and incredible capacity for both loyalty and barbarism. In fact, there is no more complete end-to-end weapon system in the inventory of war-machines. What are these cheap, renewable, plentiful, sophisticated and expendable weapons? Children.RomÃÂ©o Dallaire was first confronted with child soldiers in unnamed villages on the tops of the thousand hills of Rwanda during the genocide of 1994. The dilemma of the adult soldier who faced them is beautifully expressed in his book's title: when children are shooting at you, they are soldiers, but as soon as they are wounded or killed they are children once again.Believing that not one of us should tolerate a child being used in this fashion, Dallaire has made it his mission to end the use of child soldiers. In this book, he provides an intellectually daring and enlightening introduction to the child soldier phenomenon, as well as inspiring and concrete solutions to eradicate it.From the Hardcover edition."

Worse: both the war heroes might become aware of her powerÃ¢ÂÂher intuition, for she is their shortcut, their cheat code.
As the Monk looks into the Oldest Dance, he nearly discovers the first language of mankind, or perhaps, the first language on earth. It could take him to the Source, he believes. But he can't do that without the Devil's Book--the book that now belongs to the Mesmerizer. Soon enough, they realize that none may find what they seek unless they have the power to guess things right. Soon enough, they know who might be their Cheat Code to achieve it all. And thus, the Intuitionist fights the whispers of the ones with voice. Her purpose calls her, but she has her life to deal with--a life that is too trivial compared to the ones who want her home. And it's not easy when she must handle all promises she has made, not when the oldest dance of the universe whispers in her dreams and when the Devil's Book calls her still. In a world of voice where High Grades are too proud to lie, a promise made verbally is stronger than a red seal. So she must leave her mother's nest while keeping her promises, and in her journey, she must be aware of the whispers of the war heroes."
