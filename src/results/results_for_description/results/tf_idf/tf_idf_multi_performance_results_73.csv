,,,,,27.0,0.376,,Dear Barack: The Extraordinary Partnership of Barack Obama and Angela Merkel,"One of the great political friendships of the modern world, as told through key moments that shaped the twenty-first century Today, we know US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as two of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs most influential leaders, together at the center of some of the biggest controversies and most impressive advancements of our time. But while their friendship has been the subject of both scrutiny and admiration, few know the full story. Taking office at the height of the 2008 global recession, Obama was keenly aware of the fractured relationship between the US and Europe. And for her part, Merkel was suspicious of the charismatic newcomer who had captivated her country. Faced with the challenges of globalization, the two often clashed over policy, butÃ¢ÂÂas the first Black president and first female chancellorÃ¢ÂÂthey shared a belief that democracy could uplift the world. United by this conviction, they would forge a complicated but inspiring partnership. Dear Barack is a thoroughly researched document of the parallel trajectories that led to Obama and Merkel meeting on the world stage and the trials, both personal and political, that they confronted in office. At times in the leadersÃ¢ÂÂ own words, the book details such events as MerkelÃ¢ÂÂs historic acceptance of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs annexation of Crimea, and the 2013 NSA spying scandal, demonstrating the highs and lows of this extraordinary alliance. A story of camaraderie at a global scale, Dear Barack shows that it is possible for political adversaries to establish bonds of respectÃ¢ÂÂand even friendshipÃ¢ÂÂin the service of the free world."
,,,,,303.0,0.334,,We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy,"""We were eight years in power"" was the lament of Reconstruction-era black politicians as the American experiment in multiracial democracy ended with the return of white supremacist rule in the South. Now Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America's ""first white president.""But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period--and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation's old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective--the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president.We Were Eight Years in Power features Coates's iconic essays first published in The Atlantic,  including Fear of a Black President, The Case for Reparations and The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration, along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates's own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era. We Were Eight Years in Power is a vital account of modern America, from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment."
,,,,,7128.0,0.298,,Obama's Wars,"In ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs Wars, Bob Woodward provides the most intimate and sweeping portrait yet of the young president as commander in chief. Drawing on internal memos, classified documents, meeting notes and hundreds of hours of interviews with most of the key players, including the president, Woodward tells the inside story of Obama making the critical decisions on the Afghanistan War, the secret campaign in Pakistan and the worldwide fight against terrorism.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  At the core of ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs Wars is the unsettled division between the civilian leadership in the White House and the United States military as the president is thwarted in his efforts to craft an exit plan for the Afghanistan War.ÃÂ  ÃÂ  ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂSo whatÃ¢ÂÂs my option?Ã¢ÂÂ the president asked his war cabinet, seeking alternatives to the Afghanistan commanderÃ¢ÂÂs request for 40,000 more troops in late 2009. ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂYou have essentially given me one option. ...ItÃ¢ÂÂs unacceptable.Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ ÃÂ  ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂWell,Ã¢ÂÂ Secretary of Defense Robert Gates finally said, Ã¢ÂÂMr. President, I think we owe you that option.Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ  ÃÂ  It never came. An untamed Vice President Joe Biden pushes relentlessly to limit the military mission and avoid another Vietnam. The vice president frantically sent half a dozen handwritten memos by secure fax to Obama on the eve of the final troop decision.ÃÂ  ÃÂ  President ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs ordering a surge of 30,000 troops and pledging to start withdrawing U.S. forces by July 2011 did not end the skirmishing.ÃÂ  ÃÂ  General David Petraeus, the new Afghanistan commander, thinks time can be added to the clock if he shows progress. ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think you win this war,Ã¢ÂÂ Petraeus said privately. ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂThis is the kind of fight weÃ¢ÂÂre in for the rest of our lives and probably our kidsÃ¢ÂÂ lives.Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ  ÃÂ  Hovering over this debate is the possibility of another terrorist attack in the United States. The White House led a secret exercise showing how unprepared the government is if terrorists set off a nuclear bomb in an American cityÃ¢ÂÂwhich Obama told Woodward is at the top of the list of what he worries about all the time.ÃÂ  ÃÂ  Verbatim quotes from secret debates and White House strategy sessionsÃ¢ÂÂand firsthand accounts of the thoughts and concerns of the president, his war council and his generalsÃ¢ÂÂreveal a government in conflict, often consumed with nasty infighting and fundamental disputes.ÃÂ  ÃÂ  Woodward has discovered how the Obama White House really works, showing that even more tough decisions lie ahead for the cerebral and engaged president.ÃÂ  ÃÂ  ObamaÃ¢ÂÂs Wars offers the reader a stunning, you-are-there account of the president, his White House aides, military leaders, diplomats and intelligence chiefs in this time of turmoil and danger."

,,,,,8882.0,0.249,,A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's Mother,"A major publishing an unprecedented look into the life of the woman who most singularly shaped Barack Obama--his mother.Barack Obama has written extensively about his father, but little is known about Stanley Ann Dunham, the fiercely independent woman who raised him, the person he credits for, as he says, ""what is best in me."" Here is the missing piece of the story.Award-winning reporter Janny Scott interviewed nearly two hundred of Dunham's friends, colleagues, and relatives (including both her children), and combed through boxes of personal and professional papers, letters to friends, and photo albums, to uncover the full breadth of this woman's inspiring and untraditional life, and to show the remarkable extent to which she shaped the man Obama is today.Dunham's story moves from Kansas and Washington state to Hawaii and Indonesia. It begins in a time when interracial marriage was still a felony in much of the United States, and culminates in the present, with her son as our president- something she never got to see. It is a poignant look at how character is passed from parent to child, and offers insight into how Obama's destiny was created early, by his mother's extraordinary faith in his gifts, and by her unconventional mothering. Finally, it is a heartbreaking story of a woman who died at age fifty-two, before her son would go on to his greatest accomplishments and reflections of what she taught him."
