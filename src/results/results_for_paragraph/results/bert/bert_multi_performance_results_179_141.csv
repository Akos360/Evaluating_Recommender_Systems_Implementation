During all seasons, juvenile and adult green and Kempâs ridley sea turtles used eastern Gulf waters extensively. Low numbers of hawksbills also used the eastern Gulf of Mexico, while leatherbacks were found in the eastern Gulf during the spring and fall as they migrated through to preferred feeding and nesting grounds (Teas 1993). The western Gulf of Mexico provided year-round habitat for juvenile loggerheads and for hatchlings to adult Kempâs ridleys. Throughout the year, juvenile green turtles used western Gulf of Mexico waters (Teas 1993). During the summer and fall when prevailing currents carried them into the western Gulf, hawksbills ranging from hatchling to juvenile were common. Leatherback sea turtles migrated through the western Gulf during the spring and fall (Teas 1993). Surveys were conducted in 1991 and 1992 to establish relative sea turtle abundance and seasonality in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Braun-McNeill and Epperly 2002). The study was based on surveying fishermen along the Gulf coast from Louisiana to southern Florida year-round regarding the sighting of sea turtles. The surveys indicated that sea turtle abundance along the Gulf coast was seasonal, with turtles migrating northward in the warmer months and then migrating south in the colder months. This seasonality was in agreement with historical information obtained from turtle fisheries in the Gulf States (Stevenson 1893; Carr and Caldwell 1956). The study also demonstrated that the number of turtle sightings was significantly higher in the Florida Keys than in any other location and that, throughout the study area, most turtles tended to be located within 506 km (314 mi) from the coast (Braun-McNeill and Epperly 2002). An analysis of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) aerial survey data for September, October, and November of 1992, 1993, and 1994 was conducted to determine sea turtle spatial dynamics for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (McDaniel 1998). The results of the study indicated that sea turtles were observed at much higher rates along the Florida Gulf coast than in the western Gulf, and the highest density of observed sea turtles occurred in the Florida Keys region (0.525 turtles per square kilometer [km2] or 0.203 turtles per square mile [mi2]) (McDaniel et al. 2000). These results are similar to those obtained by Fritts et al. (1983a) discussed above. Various hypotheses were proposed to explain the higher numbers of sea turtles observed in the eastern Gulf as compared to the western Gulf of Mexico; these included the following: more suitable sea turtle habitat in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the reduction of turtles by the intense shrimp fishery in the western Gulf of Mexico, low oxygen levels off the Louisiana coast, sea turtles being attracted to shrimp vessel bycatch, and more turtles inhabiting nearshore areas compared to areas offshore (McDaniel 1998). In the same study conducted by McDaniel et al. (2000), sea turtle abundance decreased significantly west from Florida toward the north-central Gulf of Mexico and increased 20-fold in south Texas as compared to other areas surveyed in the western Gulf, ranging from no turtles up to 0.10 turtles/km2 (0.04 turtles/mi2) (McDaniel et al. 2000). This is consistent with an earlier week-long aerial survey conducted in the fall of 1979 in the same south Texas area that reported a mean sea turtle density of 0.0196 turtle/km2 (0.0076 turtles/mi2) (Reeves and Leatherwood 1983). Interestingly, a small peak around the Chandeleur Islands in Louisiana was observed (McDaniel et al. 2000); this peak around the Chandeleur Islands is important because Louisiana waters are known foraging grounds for post-nesting Kempâs ridleys (ChaÌvez 1968; Pritchard and MaÌrquez-M. 1973; Ogren 1989). In aerial surveys conducted along the U.S. Gulf Coast from September through November during 1992 through 1996, Kempâs ridleys were sighted primarily in inshore waters and most commonly occurred in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Epperly et al. 2002). During the same surveys, loggerhead sea turtles were sighted throughout the Gulf but had a very low occurrence in offshore waters of the western Gulf. Green turtles occurred offshore and primarily were"

34,807,0.755,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Most of the adult life history information available for hawksbills in the Gulf of Mexico is for the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico (Table 11.5). Most hawksbills have slow growth rates, which vary within and among populations (NMFS and USFWS 2007e); growth rates of 2â4 cm (0.8â1.6 in) per year are typical for the Caribbean (Boulon 1994). Adult hawksbills may reach up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in length and weigh up to 140 kg (308.6 lb); however, they typically average about 0.75 m (2.5 ft) in length and weigh around 80 kg (176.4 lb) or less (USFWS 2012). Recent satellite tracking studies conducted to determine the migratory patterns and feeding ground locations for hawksbills nesting on YucataÌn Peninsula beaches have indicated that turtles remain in Mexican waters (Cuevas et al. 2008, 2012). In 2006 and 2007, three postnesting females were tracked for up to 510 days from three of the major nesting beaches in Campeche; two migrated to foraging grounds off the coast of Campeche, and one migrated to the Mexican Caribbean (Cuevas et al. 2008). Ten post-nesting hawksbill sea turtles were tracked from nine different nesting beaches on the YucataÌn Peninsula in 2006 and 2007; turtles that nested on the western side of the peninsula migrated to the east, while those that nested on the eastern side migrated to the west (Cuevas et al. 2012). In a second, similar study conducted in 2011, tracked hawksbills also stayed in Mexican waters; however, one female migrated north to the border of the continental shelf, while a male stayed close to the nesting beaches (Cuevas et al. 2012)."

Japan was historically the major importer of tortoiseshell or bekko from the Caribbean (NMFS and USFWS 1993). They agreed to stop importing bekko in 1993 (USFWS 2012). Although the volume of international trade has declined significantly in the past 20 years, it remains active, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas (Mortimer 2008). In Southeast Asia, the extensive practice of selling whole, stuffed hawksbills is a relatively new threat (Mortimer 2008). Hawksbills are the most tropical of the sea turtle species and typically nest at low densities throughout their range (NMFS and USFWS 1993, 2007e). In the past, hawksbill sea turtles were considered to be naturally rare and to have a more dispersed nesting pattern than the other sea turtle species (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). However, the dispersed pattern currently observed is now believed to be the result of overexploitation of previously large colonies (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Hawksbill sea turtles are often associated with coral reefs (Meylan 1988; Meylan and Redlow 2006). There are many gaps in the understanding of hawksbill sea turtle biology, and the oceanic phase of the post-hatchlings remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of hawksbill life history (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Because of an almost total lack of long-term trend data at hawksbill foraging sites, nesting beach data are the primary information source used to evaluate trends in hawksbill populations. Few data are available on the at-sea mortality of hawksbills in fisheries (NMFS and USFWS 2007e)."
34,804,0.746,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Similar to other species of sea turtles, hatchling hawksbills enter an oceanic phase (Figure 11.44). This phase may involve long-distance travel carried by surface gyres, with eventual recruitment to neritic foraging habitat (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Hatchlings entrained in the Loop Current could be expected to remain in the Gulf of Mexico for differing periods of time, depending on which branch of the Loop Current they enter (Meylan and Redlow 2006). Both newly hatched and early juvenile hawksbills have been found in association with Sargassum and floating weed in the Atlantic and Caribbean (Table 11.5) (Carr 1987; Mellgren and Mann 1996; Musick and Limpus 1997; Meylan and Redlow 2006). No post-hatchlings but six juvenile hawksbill sea turtles, with an average size of 20.6 cm (8.1 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated, surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean from 2005 through 2011; some of these hawksbills were large enough to be on the cusp of recruitment into the neritic zone, most likely to foraging habitat in the Florida Keys (Witherington et al. 2012). Weedlines in the Gulf of Mexico likely serve as habitat for posthatchling hawksbills from nesting beaches in Mexico and Central America (NMFS and USFWS 1993). Between 1972 and 1984, 77 strandings of post-hatchling and juvenile hawksbills were recorded in Texas, with most occurring near Corpus Christi; these turtles most likely originated from nesting beaches on the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico (Amos 1989; Bowen et al. 2007). Limited tagging data indicates that some post-hatchling hawksbills from the western Gulf of Mexico disperse into the Atlantic Ocean, most likely through the Florida Straits, and move northward along Floridaâs east coast (Meylan and Redlow 2006)."

Despite the data gaps and limitations associated with specific datasets, the current conditions of the five species of sea turtles that occur in the Gulf of Mexico have been described qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively. Kempâs Ridley Sea Turtles. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Kempâs ridley sea turtle has made a remarkable recovery from the brink of extinction (Heppell et al. 2007; Crowder and Heppell 2011), although the current nesting populations remain far below historical levels. The increased abundance and nesting of Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years is most likely a result of many activities that affect all Kempâs ridley life stagesâconservation and education efforts in both Mexico and the United States, the Kempâs Ridley Recovery Program, the Kempâs Ridley Head Start Experiment, the elimination of direct harvest of eggs and adult turtles, nest and hatchling protection, TED use, shrimp fishery closures, and the reduced Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawling effort in both the United States and Mexico (Shaver and Wibbels 2007; NMFS et al. 2011; Crowder and Heppell 2011). Despite the partial success story, there are threats to Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf that could cause significant impacts to the population and affect its continued recovery, particularly the incidental bycatch. The future of Kempâs ridleys is optimistically bright, and nesting numbers at Rancho Nuevo and PAIS continue to increase; however, because of their mass nesting at a single site in the western Gulf and their restricted Gulf of Mexico distribution, a significant event or the synergistic effects of multiple threats in the Gulf could have catastrophic effects on the recovering Kempâs ridley population. Loggerhead Sea Turtles. The life history, distribution, and abundance of the loggerhead sea turtle is probably better understood than all other sea turtle species that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico (Bolten and Witherington 2003; USFWS and NMFS 2011). While the loggerhead is distributed globally, the goal of this chapter was to describe contemporary conditions of Gulf sea turtles; information for populations that occur in the Gulf of Mexico during some portion of their life cycle was the focus. These populations included the Peninsular Florida, northern Gulf of Mexico, Dry Tortugas, and Greater Caribbean subpopulations of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (USFWS and NMFS 2011). The annual nest counts from 2001 through 2009 on Florida Gulf coast and Atlantic beaches showed a decreasing trend, but in 2010 and 2011, loggerhead nest counts on surveyed Florida beaches were back to numbers similar to those recorded in 2000, indicating that the population of nesting females may have stabilized. Given the lack of a long historical record, it is not known whether these types of fluctuations are common or if the recent temporary decrease observed was caused by an acute factor. A recent analysis of annual loggerhead nest counts for the northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation indicated a significant declining trend; however, a longer time series of nesting data is needed for an adequate evaluation (NMFS and USFWS 2008). More years of data are also needed in order to detect a trend in loggerhead nest counts for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation. Nesting for the Greater Caribbean subpopulation appears to be stable; however, a trend analysis is challenging because standardized surveys are few, survey efforts have changed, and low-level nesting occurs in many locations (NMFS and USFWS 2008). High cumulative anthropogenic threat levels were estimated for oceanic and neritic juveniles and adults of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS during the most recent loggerhead status review (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011). The loggerhead mortalities associated with these high threat levels resulted primarily from fisheries bycatch. Significant loggerhead mortality occurred in longline fisheries, bottom and mid-water trawl fisheries, dredge fisheries, gillnet fisheries, and pot/trap fisheries that occur not only in U.S. waters (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011; Ponwith 2011), but also in the Azores, the Mediterranean, on the Grand Banks, in Canadian waters, and in other locations throughout the range of the northwest Atlantic Ocean"

Unlike other sea turtle species, hawksbills nest in low densities on scattered, small beaches (USFWS 2012). Throughout their range, hawksbills nest in at least 70 countries on insular and mainland sandy beaches and inhabit coastal waters of more than 100 countries NMFS and USFWS (1993, 2007e). In 2007, at 83 nesting sites distributed among ten ocean regions around the world, approximately 21,212â28,138 hawksbills were estimated to nest each year (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; USFWS 2012). Although greatly depleted compared to historical levels, nesting populations in the Atlantic Ocean are generally doing better than those in the Indo-Pacific (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Hawksbill nesting in the Caribbean accounts for approximately 20â30 % of the worldâs hawksbill sea turtle population, and the number of hawksbill sea turtles living in the Caribbean was estimated at 27,000 in 2003 (Lutz et al. 2003; USFWS 2012). In the Atlantic, more population increases have been recorded in the Insular Caribbean, as compared to populations on the western Caribbean mainland or in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Historically, Panama supported the single most important nesting population in the Caribbean, but hawksbill nesting at ChiriquÄ±Ì Beach in Panama has declined by more than 95 % during the past 50 years (Carr 1979; Meylan and Donnelly 1999). The YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico now supports the largest nesting hawksbill population in the area (Figure 11.41) (Cuevas et al. 2010). The Insular Caribbean has eight nesting concentrations of hawksbills: Antigua/Barbuda (especially Jumby Bay), Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba (Doce Leguas Cays), Jamaica, Puerto Rico (especially Mona Island), Trinidad and Tobago, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (especially Buck Island Reef National Monument [BIRNM], an uninhabited island about 2.4 km [1.5 mi] north of the northeast coast of St. Croix) (Figure 11.41) (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). In 2002, 400â833 nesting females, or 2,000â2,500 nests, were estimated for Doce Leguas Cays, Cuba (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; Mortimer and Donnelly 2008; USFWS 2012). From 2001 through 2005, 199â332 nests were recorded each year on Mona Island, Puerto Rico, and 51â85 nests were recorded each season for Culebra Island, Caja de Muertos, and Humacao, Puerto Rico (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; USFWS 2012). From 2001 through 2006, an average of 56 nests were laid each year at BIRNM in the U.S. Virgin Islands, while 30â222 nests were laid in 2006 on U.S. Virgin Islands beaches outside BIRNM (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; USFWS 2012)."

In addition, habitat loss in the Caribbean could cause more hawksbills to move into the Gulf of Mexico (Hopkins and Richardson 1984; Thompson et al. 1990)."
34,827,0.702,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed, often leading to the destruction of hawksbill nesting habitat (Mortimer and Donnelly 2008). For example, critical hawksbill habitats are quickly being impacted by the development along the Gulf coast of the YucataÌn Peninsula (GardunÌo-Andrade et al. 1999). Beachfront development and the clearing of dune vegetation significantly affect hawksbill sea turtles because they prefer to nest under vegetation (Mortimer and Donnelly 2008). Global climate change may affect sea turtle nesting beaches in several ways, including sea level rise, higher ambient temperatures, and changes in hurricane/cyclone activity (Hawkes et al. 2009; Witt et al. 2010). Higher water levels associated with sea level rise will gradually and directly decrease the availability of suitable nesting sites (Witt et al. 2010). Increasing temperatures may open up areas that were previously unavailable for nesting (Witt et al. 2010), but recent studies have suggested that up to half of the currently available sea turtle nesting areas could be lost with predicted sea level rise (Fish et al. 2008). Sea turtle nesting is significantly affected by temperature, and incubation temperatures can affect incubation success, duration, and the sex of hatchlings (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980; Witt et al. 2010; Valverde et al. 2010). Therefore, increasing temperatures have the potential to change current nest incubation regimes, as well as to skew sex ratios (Hawkes et al. 2007a). Changes in the global climate are predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of hurricanes (Webster et al. 2005), which can significantly affect the reproductive success of sea turtles. On Gulf of Mexico beaches, predation of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings can be significant. Known predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings include raccoons, ghost crabs, coyotes, foxes, armadillos, domestic dogs and cats, feral pigs, skunks, bobcats, badgers, gulls, fish crows, and larval insects (Witherington et al. 2006a; NMFS et al. 2011). Invasive fire ants are also significant predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings on Gulf coast nesting beaches (Witherington et al. 2006a; NMFS et al. 2011). Invasive plant species are known to invade and desiccate eggs, trap hatchlings, interfere with nest construction, and lower nest incubation temperatures because of shading (Conant et al. 2009). For example, the invasive Australian pine has caused shading of beaches, lowered sea turtle nest incubation temperatures, limited accessibility to suitable nest sites, entrapped nesting turtles, interfered with nest construction, and caused sea turtle nesting activity to decline on a remote nesting beach in Everglades National Park along the Florida Gulf coast (Davis and Whiting 1977; Schmeltz and Mezich 1988; Reardon and Mansfield 1997; Hanson et al. 1998). The hurricane season for the Gulf overlaps closely with the sea turtle nesting season (Magnuson et al. 1990). While sea turtles have evolved to deal with erosion, flooding, storm surges, and other disturbances caused by hurricanes and other severe storms by laying large numbers of eggs and distributing their nests spatially and temporally, hurricanes can affect the reproductive success of sea turtles, since they rely on specific beaches for reproduction (Carr and Carr 1972). In addition, the effects of hurricanes vary by species (Pike and Stiner 2007). For example, in the southeastern United States, leatherback turtles nest the earliest, and most hatchlings emerge before the hurricane season starts, while loggerhead turtles nest intermediately, and only nests laid late in the season would be at risk. However, green turtles nest the latest, and their entire nesting season occurs during the hurricane season; therefore, their developing eggs and nests are extremely vulnerable to hurricanes (Pike and Stiner 2007). In 1989, the effects of Hurricane Gilbert were documented on the Kempâs ridley nesting beach in Mexico. When debris was deposited, the beach was eroded, and coral rock was exposed along the central portion of Rancho Nuevo. About 20 % of the Kempâs ridley nesting activity was displaced to the north that year (MaÌrquez-M. 1990). Hurricane Andrew, a Category 4 hurricane that hit south Florida on August 24, 1992, provided an opportunity to quantify the impacts of a major hurricane on six beaches where"
34,683,0.699,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Until 1890, the sea turtle fisheries in Florida occurred in eight counties, but by 1897 they were concentrated in four: Monroe, Levy, Franklin, and Escambia counties on the Gulf coast. The total production in 1897 alone was 287,857 kg (634,616 lb), with 86 % coming from Monroe County at the southern tip of Florida (Townsend 1899). However, an unspecified portion of the total production came from the YucataÌn coast because turtles were already becoming scarce in Florida; by 1897, most of the turtles came from the YucataÌn coast. Apparently, the decrease in the sea turtle populations along the Florida Gulf coast was due not only to the harvest of juveniles but also of eggs, as these were sought after eagerly by local people (Townsend 1899). Indeed, although few records of egg exploitation exist, it is believed that a large number of eggs were collected throughout the entire rim of the Gulf of Mexico (Hildebrand 1963; Witzell 1994). Turtles were so scarce by the late 1800s that Townsend (1899) called for the protection of the turtles and their eggs during their breeding season. The sea turtle fisheries continued through the early and mid-1900s on the Florida Gulf coast, though at a much lower rate (Figure 11.4), presumably due to decreases in the turtle populations (Rebel 1974). The landings records for Florida indicate a preference for green turtle meat (Figure 11.4). In the 1900s, imports of live turtles into the United States were significant prior to the 1978 listing of sea turtles under the 1973 U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The total live sea turtle imports into the United States from 1948 through 1976 amounted to 8,099,950 kg (17,857,334 lb), with a peak in 1951 and a decreasing trend to a minimum of 1,814 kg (4,000 lb) in 1975 (Figure 11.5) (Cato et al. 1978). The imported species of sea turtles included the green, olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), loggerhead, and hawksbill, with the former two species being the most imported (Cato et al. 1978). These imports came from over 40 countries and demonstrate the demand for live sea turtles that existed in the United States until the"

Before 1956, no records documented green turtle nesting on Gulf of Mexico beaches or elsewhere in the continental United States However, green turtle populations are known to have been abundant historically as described in Section 11.1.2 (Meylan et al. 1995). Extensive seagrass beds in south Texas bays were once an important feeding ground for the green sea turtle (Owens et al. 1983). A review of the green turtle nesting data through 2001 for the Tortuguero, YucataÌn Peninsula, and Florida nesting beaches indicated that all three western Atlantic Ocean subpopulations were increasing (IUCN 2004). The population of nesting females for the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea was estimated to range from 30,981 to 31,981 in 2001, a 13 to 66 % increase over past published estimates (IUCN 2004). Green turtle nesting in Tortuguero has increased significantly since the 1970s (NMFS and USFWS 2007c). Evaluation of the trend in nesting activity on the Tortuguero beach indicated a relatively steady increase from 1971 to the mid-1980s, constant or possibly decreasing nesting during the late 1980s, and then resumption of an upward trend in the 1990s (Bjorndal et al. 1999). About 41,250 adult female green turtles emerged on beaches each year from 1971 through 1975, and from 1992 through 1996, approximately 72,200 females emerged per year (Bjorndal et al. 1999). Approximately 104,411 nests per year were laid on the beach at Tortuguero from 1999 through 2003, which corresponds to about 17,402â37,290 nesting female green turtles each year (TroeÌng and Rankin 2005). More than 80,000 green turtle nests were estimated for Tortuguero each year from 2003 through 2009, with a high of almost 178,000 estimated nests or about 68,000 estimated nesting females in 2007 (Figure 11.29)."
34,786,0.689,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","2006). Low numbers of leatherback nesting also occur along the southeast Atlantic coast of the United States, from central Florida through North Carolina (Figure 11.35). In the Gulf of Mexico, leatherback sea turtles nest at low levels along the Florida, Alabama, and Mexican coasts (Figure 11.35). Leatherback nesting was reported as early as 1962 on a beach near Destin along the Florida Gulf coast (Yerger 1965). As indicated by reports from local residents, leatherbacks may have nested on Texas beaches in the 1920s and 1930s (Hildebrand 1963). One leatherback nest was recorded at PAIS in 2008 (NPS 2013d). Leatherback sea turtles that forage in and travel through the Gulf of Mexico originate from many different nesting beaches. For example, leatherbacks that were tagged while nesting on the Florida east coast and St. Croix were later recaptured along the Mexican Gulf coast (Eckert et al. 2012). In addition, leatherbacks that nest on Gulf of Mexico beaches migrate to and forage in waters outside the Gulf, and many satellite tracking studies have shown that leatherback sea turtles that nest in the western Atlantic migrate to Western Europe and West Africa (Eckert et al. 2012). Therefore, using data from nesting beaches of leatherbacks known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico to evaluate the population of leatherback sea turtles that use the Gulf is extremely challenging. However, to determine trends in leatherback nesting in the general western Atlantic Ocean area, data from two important nesting beaches in the area with longterm monitoring were evaluated: the Florida east coast and Tortuguero, Costa Rica. In addition, recent investigations have suggested that the Gulf of Mexico may be a significant year-round foraging ground for leatherbacks that nest along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, as well as Panama (Evans et al. 2007; Fossette et al. 2010)."

While extensive surveys in the northwest Atlantic Ocean have resulted in the sightings of thousands of loggerheads, green turtles are rarely observed (Witherington 2002; Bolten 2003; Witherington et al. 2012). A recent analysis of stable isotopes in green turtle scute tissue suggested that, before recruiting to neritic habitats, green turtles occupy similar habitats and feed at the same trophic level as oceanic-stage loggerheads for 3â5 years (Reich et al. 2007b). Fifteen post-hatchling green turtles, with an average size of 5.4 cm (2.1 in) SCL and 44 juveniles, with an average size of 20.6 cm (8.1 in) SCL, were observed and/or captured as part of a study to determine the importance of the pelagic Sargassum-dominated drift community to young sea turtles in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico from 2005 through 2011 (Witherington et al. 2012). In contrast to loggerheads, the post-hatchling green turtles were active within the Sargassum or swimming. There was a size gap of 9 cm (3.5 in) between the juvenile and post-hatchling green turtles. Juveniles were estimated to be 1â2 years old, indicating that two discrete life stages of green turtles were observed in the Sargassum community (Witherington et al. 2012)."

34,724,0.684,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","In a related satellite telemetry study, the inshore and continental shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico were shown to serve as developmental and migratory habitat for the Kempâs ridley sea turtle (Seney and Landry 2011). Fifteen juveniles were fitted with transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast from 2004 through 2007. Their movements were restricted to the continental shelf from Matagorda Bay, Texas, east to waters offshore Timbalier Bay, Louisiana, and during most or all of the tracking period, the juveniles remained primarily in waters less than 5 m (16.4 ft) deep (Seney and Landry 2011). While movement patterns varied among years, the juvenile Kempâs ridleys were tracked primarily during the warmer months and preferred tidal passes, bays, coastal lakes, and nearshore waters. In addition, this investigation suggested that the preferred habitat of juvenile Kempâs ridleys may differ among years and could be related to the locations and abundances of specific prey items (Seney and Landry 2011). The movements of juvenile Kempâs ridleys in an understudied region of the Kempâs ridley rangeâthe north-central Gulf of Mexicoâwere studied by satellite tracking 12 turtles that were captured incidentally by recreational fishermen on piers or stranded live in Mississippi and Alabama, and rehabilitated and released (Lyn et al. 2012). Six turtles were released in Mississippi waters, 3.2 km (2 mi) south of East Ship Island, in November 2010, and six were released near documented feeding grounds off the Cedar Keys in Florida in April 2011. The turtles released in Mississippi migrated to warmer waters offshore (when the water temperatures decreased) and stayed in the general area of Mississippi Sound and adjacent Louisiana waters. However, within days of being released, most of the turtles released in Florida quickly began swimming up the coastline toward Alabama and Mississippi. One of the turtles released in Florida, a newly mature male, was tracked all the way to Rancho Nuevo, Mexico; it remained in this area for 2 weeks in March before returning north to waters along the Texas/Louisiana border. The results of this study indicated that releasing turtles near their hooking/stranding location is preferred over releasing them in known feeding grounds (Lyn et al. 2012). A number of in-water tagging studies have characterized sea turtle distribution, abundance, use, and ecology in nearshore waters along the Florida Gulf coast. Nearshore waters that have been studied include Apalachee Bay (Rudloe et al. 1991; Campbell 1996), Deadman Bay (Barichivich 2006), Cedar Keys/Waccasassa Bay (Schmid and Ogren 1990; Schmid 1998; Schmid et al. 2002, 2003), Tampa Bay (Nelson 2000), Charlotte Harbor Estuary (Schmid 2011), and Ten Thousand Islands/Gullivan Bay (Witzell and Schmid 2004, 2005). Details of these investigations are presented in the following paragraphs. However, information gaps still exist since the Florida Gulf coast is extensive, and long-term, in-water studies are needed to monitor the status of juvenile sea turtles at key foraging areas (Eaton et al. 2008). Rudloe et al. (1991) conducted a tagging study of post-oceanic juvenile Kempâs ridleys that were incidentally captured during shrimp trawling, gill netting, or fish seining in the coastal waters of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, including Apalachee, Levy, and Dickerson bays, from 1984 through 1988. A total of 106 turtles, ranging in size from 20.3 to 57.9 cm (8 to 22.8 in) SCL (mean 36.7 cm [14.4 in] SCL), were collected over a 97 km (60 mi) stretch of the Florida Gulf coast from Shell Point, Wakulla County to St. George Island, Franklin County. While turtles were collected every month, the highest numbers of turtles were collected during May and December. Turtles obtained during December, January, and February were significantly larger than those collected in June, July, August, and September (means of 40.4 cm [15.9 in] SCL and 30 cm [11.8 in] SCL, respectively). Kempâs ridleys were collected from seagrass, sand, and mud bottom substrates at depths ranging from 0.3 m (1 ft) inshore to 32 m (105 ft) 9.7 km (6 mi) offshore, with the smallest turtles collected from depths of less than 2 m (6.5 ft). Since turtles were only recaptured within a season, the results of the study indicated a transitory Kempâs ridley population along the northwest Florida Panhandle coast. In a netting study"

In the Gulf of Mexico, information regarding the distribution and abundance of leatherback sea turtles, which is summarized in the following paragraphs, is incomplete. However, adult leatherback distribution in the Gulf of Mexicoâwhether in deep-sea, pelagic waters, along the continental shelf, or in nearshore watersâhas historically been associated with dense concentrations of jellyfish (Leary 1957; Fritts et al. 1983a, b; den Hartog and van Nierop 1984; Lohoefener et al. 1989; Eckert et al. 1989a, 2012; Houghton et al. 2006). In the 1950s, Florida fishermen reported occasional sightings of leatherbacks off the coast of Sarasota and claimed they had been seen occasionally in the area since at least the 1930s (Yerger 1965). A leatherback carcass was found in Copano Bay, Texas in 1951 (Gunter 1951). In 1956, 100 leatherbacks were reported only 75 yards from the beach in Port Aransas, Texas. This group of leatherbacks appeared to be associated with a large abundance of jellyfish in the area (Leary 1957). Multiple sightings and captures of leatherbacks occurred along the Florida Gulf coast during the early 1960s (Yerger 1965). In fact, leatherbacks were once reported to be seasonally abundant off the coast of Panama City, Florida (Pritchard 1976). In 1975, leatherbacks were observed off the coast of Alabama (Mount 1975). In 1979, aerial surveys of the Texas and Florida Gulf coasts reported more than 97 % of all turtle sightings to be in Florida, four of which were leatherbacks (Fritts and Reynolds 1981). Aerial surveys conducted in the Gulf of Mexico from May 1980 to April 1981 reported a total of 47 leatherbacks across all areas (except off the coast of south Texas), and found leatherbacks to be most common off the coast of Florida (Fritts et al. 1983a, b). During the survey, leatherbacks were more conspicuous on the continental shelf than in adjacent deeper waters (Fritts et al. 1983a, b). Between 1988 and 1990, NMFS aerial surveys in the Gulf of Mexico reported infrequent sightings of leatherbacks, with most sightings occurring in July through November 1989 (Lohoefener et al. 1990). A survey of sea turtles in southeastern Louisiana in 1988 reported that the only evidence of leatherbacks in the area was one report from a diver in July 1988 (Fuller 1989). During the summer of 1989, six leatherback sightings were reported in south Louisiana, five of which were by divers most likely diving offshore at oil platforms (Fuller 1989). During a 1989 cruise in the Gulf of Mexico by the University of West Florida to the head of De Soto Canyon to collect neuston and Sargassum, eight leatherbacks were sighted near a coastal-subtropical water mass boundary region that contained high densities of jellyfish (Collard 1990). Beginning in 1992, the U.S. Geological Survey performed a 3-year aerial and ship survey of the entire northern Gulf of Mexico. The study estimated an overall abundance of 168 leatherbacks in the continental slope area and also estimated leatherbacks to be 12 times more abundant in the winter than in the summer (Davis et al. 2000). Aerial surveys by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center during the fall of 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1996 sighted a total of three leatherbacks in the western Gulf of Mexico and eight in the eastern Gulf; only two of the turtles sighted were in water less than approximately 18 m (59 ft) deep (Epperly et al. 2002). In CMR studies, the low recapture rate of leatherbacks, compared to other species of sea turtles, is likely due to their highly pelagic lifestyle and uncommon occurrence in coastal waters. However, captures and tag returns of leatherbacks have indicated that adult females use the Gulf of Mexico as a foraging ground. From 1970 to 1973, researchers in Suriname and French Guiana tagged more than 2,000 nesting female leatherbacks. Two of the turtles that were tagged on French Guiana beaches in 1970 and 1972, respectively, were recaptured in western Gulf of Mexico waters in 1973 (Pritchard 1976). Also, a nesting female tagged on the Costa Rican coast in 1985 was captured a year later by a shrimp fisherman off the Mississippi"

34,1023,0.656,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Much of the focus in this chapter and by state and federal agencies, scientists and others, deals with birds that concentrate along the coasts. It is far easier to census birds nesting there than it is to study pelagic seabirds. However, many seabirds mainly use the open, pelagic zones of the Gulf of Mexico. Seabirds do not simply migrate over or around the Gulf, but instead use the open waters of the Gulf for wintering and foraging. The Gulf waters also provide foraging habitat for more tropical-nesting species, some of which use the Campeche Banks for breeding (Tunnell and Chapman 2000), such as frigatebirds and boobies, and for North Atlantic-nesting species, such as Northern Gannet (see section below). Of all the birds considered, the distribution and behavior of pelagic species are the most affected by prey availability and oceanic features (Hunt 1990; Schneider 1991; Ribic et al. 1997; Schreiber and Burger 2001a, b; Zuria and Mellink 2005). In the Gulf of Mexico, the Loop Current and eddy systems greatly affect distribution of seabirds in the northern region (Ribic et al. 1997). Prey is not evenly distributed over the open ocean; individual prey patches are often small and interspersed (Hunt and Schneider 1987). Foraging seabirds can search for prey by (1) looking for the presence of feeding birds (plunge-diving) as a signal of prey availability (Simmons 1972; Gotmark et al. 1986; Gochfeld and Burger 1982), (2) looking for other seabirds flying in the same direction, presumably toward a prey patch, (3) watching birds that return to a colony with food (Gaston and Nettleship 1981), (4) searching for particular oceanographic conditions, and (5) returning to known foraging areas. Whether or not to associate with marine mammals is another decision foraging seabirds make (Burger 1988b, c). Foraging with mammals (whales, dolphins) can make prey fish more available and identify large expanses of zooplankton; it can also result in competition or interference foraging (Pierotti 1988a). Marine birds and mammals can interact in at least five ways: (1) birds can have passive associations; (2) birds can be attracted to the same resource; (3) birds can be actively drawn to marine mammals because they drive prey to the surface; (4) birds can be attracted to marine mammals to scavenge on by-products of mammal foraging; and (5) birds can actively avoid marine mammals that might prey on them; for example, Orcas eat diving birds (Pierotti 1988b). Seabirds often forage over schools of prey fish that have been forced to the surface by predatory fish, such as bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) or tuna (Safina and Burger 1985, 1988;"
34,1046,0.653,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Niven and Butcher (2011) reported that among the 20 species that declined by at least 2 % per year, 13 had the center of their ranges in the Gulf, and four declined in the Gulf, but were increasing elsewhere (Canada Geese [Branta Canadensis], American Wigeon, Bonaparteâs Gull, Boat-tailed Grackle). These birds may be moving their wintering ranges farther north with global warming (Niven et al. 2009). Several species with winter ranges south of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast also declined (Eared Grebe [Podiceps nigricollis], Wilsonâs Plover, Long-billed Curlew, Western Sandpiper, Red Knot, Black Skimmer and American Bittern [Botaurus lentiginosus]). Remarkably, these were mainly shorebirds, reflecting a general decline in shorebirds worldwide (Withers 2002; Morrison et al. 2006). Surprisingly, Canada Geese showed the greatest decline. While a 2 % per year increase or decline may not seem significant in terms of overall population dynamics, it is when an average of 2 % per year change for 40 years. Second, although there are methodological and interpretational difficulties with Christmas Bird Count data, the results are both consistent and robust over a long period of time. And finally, the changes make sense in terms of possible effects of global warming, and threats to birds that use coastal beaches (habitat losses, erosion, human disturbance, pets, and pollution)."

The spring cruise spanned 44 days and covered 6,401 km of both the oceanic Gulf and continental shelf, the mid-summer cruise was 17 days and covered 2,500 km (track line in the Gulf that included eddies), and the late summer cruise was 16 days and covered 2,015 km (Hess and Ribic 2000). During the spring cruise, 5,918 seabirds were recorded during 334.8 effort hours. Terns were the most abundant group; Sooty Terns were the most abundant tern (Hess and Ribic 2000). All the other, more pelagic seabirds were much more rare in abundance. The majority of gulls observed were Laughing Gulls. About the same overall percentage of species groups were observed in the mid/late summer as in the spring. Overall the number of birds per effort hour varied by season, with the lowest level occurring in May to June (0.61 sightings per effort hour for all birds), and the highest level occurring in August to September (26.41 sightings per effort hour, mainly due to terns). Shearwater numbers were highest in August to September (1.30), Storm Petrels were highest in August (1.84), frigatebirds were highest in August (1.06), Sulids (boobies) were highest in February (0.60), tropicbirds were highest in AugustâSeptember (0.03), jaegers"

The females typically left the vicinity of the nesting beach within 24 h of nesting, and movements were usually highly directed. The post-nesting females took up residence in well-defined, relatively small (median size of 2,000 km2 [772 mi2]) areas on the continental shelf adjacent to Florida, Texas, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba within a few weeks of departing from the nesting beaches (Foley et al. 2008). Sixty percent of the turtles (22 of 38) from both nesting assemblages took up residence off the Florida Gulf coast between the Dry Tortugas and Cape San Blas. The distribution of resident areas of female loggerheads from both nesting assemblages overlapped off the western coast of Florida, the western and northern coast of the YucataÌn Peninsula, and the northern coast of Cuba (Foley et al. 2008). Migrations of 28 post-nesting loggerheads from nesting beaches in Sarasota Countyâtheir most important Gulf of Mexico rookeryâwere tracked between May 2005 and December 2007 (Girard et al. 2009). Post-nesting migrations were completed in 3â68 days. Five different migration patterns were observed and included the following: six turtles remained in the vicinity of their nesting site; nine migrated to the southwestern part of the Florida Shelf; two migrated to the northeast Gulf of Mexico; five turtles migrated to the YucataÌn Shelf in the southern Gulf of Mexico, Campeche Bay, or Cuba; and six loggerheads migrated to the Bahamas. Loggerheads moved along rather straight routes over the continental shelf but showed more indirect paths in oceanic waters. Smaller turtles remained on the Florida Shelf, and larger individuals showed various migration strategies, staying on the Florida Shelf or moving to long-distance foraging grounds (Girard et al. 2009). Hart et al. (2012a) recently completed a study that identified shared regional at-sea foraging areas for female loggerheads, which was the first study to consolidate tracking data from three different nesting subpopulations in the Gulf. Ten females from nesting beaches of three subpopulations (St. Joseph Peninsula for northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation, Casey Key for Peninsular Florida subpopulation, and DTNP for Dry Tortugas subpopulation) in the Gulf of Mexico were satellite tracked in 2008, 2009, and 2010. All turtles migrated to discrete foraging sites in two common areas located off southwest Florida and the northern YucataÌn Peninsula, located 102â904 km (63.4â561.7 mi) from the nesting beaches. Within 3â35 days, turtles migrated to the foraging sites, where they all displayed high site fidelity over time. The results of the study indicated that different nesting aggregations of loggerheads in the Gulf of Mexico use common at-sea foraging areas, and these important areas should be protected (Hart et al. 2012a). In a study of nearshore waters of Gullivan Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, that was conducted from 1997 through 2004, few loggerheads (15 turtles averaging 65.5 cm [25.8 in] SCL) were captured, possibly because they prefer deeper waters (Witzell and Schmid 2004, 2005). During surveys conducted at Key West National Wildlife Refuge (KWNWR) from 2002 through 2006, more than 470 loggerhead sea turtles were sighted, and 182 neritic juveniles and adults, ranging in size from 36.4 to 98.1 cm (14.3 to 38.6 in) SCL and averaging 75.5 cm (29.7 in) SCL, were captured, demonstrating the importance of this area as a foraging site for these size classes (Eaton et al. 2008). A long-term study of Florida Bay demonstrated that this area provided year-round resident foraging areas for large numbers of juvenile and male and female adult loggerhead sea turtles (Schroeder et al. 2003; Eaton et al. 2008; Conant et al. 2009). From 1990 through 2006, 902 loggerheads were captured; they ranged in size from 33 to 98.7 cm (13 to 38.9 in) SCL, averaging 77.7 cm (30.6 in) SCL. Multiple recaptures of juvenile and adult loggerheads over periods of up to 10 years indicated some strong site fidelity within Florida Bay. Genetic studies have demonstrated that more than 80 % of the adult loggerheads that forage in Florida Bay are from the Peninsular Florida subpopulation, while about 10 % are from the Quintana Roo, Mexico nesting population (Heppell et al. 2003)."

A number of non-Passerine species (N Â¼ 93) occurred in all 12 sectors of the Gulf of Mexico (Table 12.4). Only the non-Passerines are listed because they are more typical of the species that inhabit the coastal and marine areas. The non-Passerines that are distributed throughout the Gulf include ducks, grebes, loons, boobies, pelicans, herons, egrets, ibises, spoonbills, storks, rails, shorebirds, gulls, terns, skimmers, and a kingfisher. As might be expected, shorebirds (N Â¼ 31 species), ducks (N Â¼ 10 species), herons and egrets (N Â¼ 10), and gulls and terns (N Â¼ 13) are the most diverse groups.

Juvenile Kempâs ridleys in the oceanic zone feed mostly on pelagic invertebrate prey associated with the Sargassum community (Table 11.1). No post-hatchling Kempâs ridleys were collected from the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast from 2005 through 2011 as part of a study to determine the importance of the pelagic Sargassum-dominated drift community to young sea turtles (Witherington et al. 2012). Hatchlings are typically around 4 cm (1.6 in) SCL in size (Table 11.1); the smallest Kempâs ridley collected by Witherington et al. (2012) was 17 cm (6.7 in) SCL. Witherington et al. (2012) sampled only in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from May through September, and post-hatchling Kempâs ridley would most likely occur in the western Gulf of Mexico off the principal nesting beaches. Thirty-eight juvenile Kempâs ridleys, ranging in size from 17 to 28 cm (6.7 to 11 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from 2005 through 2011 (Witherington et al. 2012). These turtles were estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old. Because they were similar in size to the lower size range observed in nearby neritic habitats (Schmid 1998; Witzell and Schmid 2004) and because most of these turtles were not found within currents that would transport them out of the Gulf, they were hypothesized to be on the cusp of recruiting into coastal habitats of the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico. Similar to what was proposed by Collard and Ogren (1990), these data suggest that an important recruitment pulse occurs primarily in the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico, marking the end of the oceanic juvenile stage and the beginning of the neritic juvenile stage and suggests that the open waters of the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico are of unique importance to Kempâs ridley sea turtles (Witherington et al. 2012)."

(1996) later estimated that only 34,500 nesting females remained worldwide in 1995. However, the most recent population estimate for the entire north Atlantic Ocean ranged from 34,000 to 94,000 adult leatherback sea turtles, and the global population was determined to be slightly female biased, ranging from 51.9 to 66.7 % female (TEWG 2007)."
230,137,0.624,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"4.4 Ingestion of Plastic Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is less visible than entanglement. Table 4.2 and Online Supplement 1 show that ingestion of plastic debris has currently been documented for 100 % of marine turtles (7 of 7 species), 59 % of whales (47 of 80), 36 % of seals (12 of 33), and 40 % of seabirds (164 of 406). In comparison to the review by Laist (1997) the number of bird + turtle + mammal species with known ingestion of plastics increased from 143 (33 %) to 233 (44 %). Studies on the ingestion of plastics by fish and invertebrates are largely a recent development. Currently, low proportions of fish and invertebrate species are presented in the tables, but a rapid increase in publications and species numbers are expected in this currently dynamic field of research. Records of plastic ingestion date back to the early days of plastic production in the 1960s. One of the first birds recorded to contain plastic was Leachâs storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) off New Foundland in 1962 (Rothstein 1973). The first report of a leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) with plastic dates back to 1968 (Mrosovsky et al. 2009). While the first record of anthropogenic debris in sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) was a fish hook found in a stomach in 1895, the first report of ingested plastic in sperm whales dates back to 1979 (de Stephanis et al. 2013). The first fish feeding on plastic was published in 1972 (Carpenter et al. 1972). The ingestion of plastics became a more commonly reported phenomenon from the 1970s onwards (Kenyon and Kridler 1969; Crockett and Reed 1976; Bourne and Imber 1982; Furness 1983; Day et al. 1985). A trend for birds ingesting plastic was probably first noted by Harper and Fowler (1987). Between 1958 and 1959 they found no plastic in prions (Pachyptila spp.) but from then on there was an upward trend in plastic consumption until 1977. A peak of plastic ingestion was detected in 1985 and 1995 in a number of long-term studies (Moser and Lee 1992; Robards et al. 1995; Spear et al. 1995; Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Van Franeker et al. 2011). In contrast to the continuing growth of global plastic use and increase in marine activities, the trend of plastic consumption decreased and stabilized from 2000 onwards approaching the 1980s level (Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Van Franeker et al."

Satellite tracking studies have indicated that post-nesting female Kempâs ridleys travel along coastal corridors (typically shallower than 50 m [164 ft]) along the rim of the Gulf of Mexico basin, extending from the YucataÌn Peninsula to southern Florida (Byles 1989; Byles and Plotkin 1994; Renaud 1995; Renaud et al. 1996; Shaver 1999, 2001a, b; Morreale et al. 2007). Many of these turtles settled in resident feeding areas for up to several months after migrating, which demonstrated that Kempâs ridley post-nesting migrations could also be considered foraging migrations to fixed destinations (Byles and Plotkin 1994). Between 1997 and 2006, the movements of 28 turtles (17 wild-stock and 11 head-started) that nested on North Padre Island or Mustang Island, Texas, were monitored using satellite telemetry to obtain habitat use and movement information for Kempâs ridleys that nested in south Texas (Shaver and Rubio 2008). Internesting residency was documented off south Texas, and post-nesting residency occurred in Gulf of Mexico waters from south Texas to the southern tip of Florida. After nesting for the season was complete, most of the Kempâs ridleys left south Texas and traveled, parallel to the coastline, to the northern or eastern Gulf of Mexico. This study demonstrated the importance of nearshore Gulf waters to post-nesting Kempâs ridleys, and the results were used to develop a regulation to close nearshore south Texas waters seasonally to shrimp trawling (Shaver and Rubio 2008). The inshore and continental shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico along the upper Texas coast were recently demonstrated to serve as migratory, internesting, and postnesting habitat for adult Kempâs ridleys (Seney and Landry 2008, 2011). Six female Kempâs ridleys were fitted with satellite transmitters after nesting and tracked during 2005 and 2006 (Seney and Landry 2008). In a second investigation, seven adult females (six nesting and one trawl-caught) were fitted with transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast during 2004 through 2007 to characterize their movements, migration patterns, and foraging grounds in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (Seney and Landry 2011). During both tracking studies, the females remained in the Galveston region and in the vicinity of the upper Texas coast during their internesting intervals and moved eastward along the continental shelf (20 m [66 ft] isobath) to offshore foraging areas of central Louisiana upon entering the post-nesting stage (Seney and Landry 2008, 2011). The importance of nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters, specifically off the Louisiana coast, as critical foraging habitat for post-nesting Kempâs ridleys was recently demonstrated by Shaver et al. (2013). Satellite telemetry and switching state-space modeling was used to track 31 turtles after nesting at PAIS and Rancho Nuevo for 13 years from 1998 through 2011. Multiple turtles foraged along their migratory route before arriving at their final foraging sites. Nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters served as foraging habitat for all turtles tracked in the study, and final foraging sites were located in water less than 68 m (223 ft) deep and a mean distance of 33.2 km (20.6 mi) from the nearest mainland coast. The wide distribution of foraging sites indicates that a foraging corridor exists for Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf of Mexico (Shaver et al. 2013). In the spring, mature female Kempâs ridleys undertake annual migrations to the western Gulf of Mexico and gather along the coast of Tamaulipas near the village of Rancho Nuevo to nest on the many kilometers of almost continuous sand beach (Pritchard 2007a, b). Reproductive females begin to arrive offshore Rancho Nuevo in March and April, with most arriving during May and June, and remain in the vicinity through the nesting season (Table 11.1) (Rostal 1991; Seney 2008). About a month before the nesting season begins, females and males aggregate to mate in nearshore waters near the beach at Rancho Nuevo (Pritchard 1969; Mendonca and Pritchard 1986)."

34,826,0.622,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, beaches are cleaned by mechanical raking, scraping with large machinery, hand raking, and picking up debris by hand. These activities can directly and indirectly affect sea turtles (NMFS et al. 2011). Driving is permitted on many Gulf of Mexico beaches. Nesting sea turtles have been run over and killed by vehicles, and vehicles have crushed emerging hatchlings (NMFS et al. 2011). Because the Kempâs ridley has only one primary nesting beach in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and a secondary nesting colony at PAIS in Texas, it is particularly susceptible to beach disturbance, alteration, and destruction by natural and anthropogenic events. Beach cleaning has been documented to affect Kempâs ridleys. For example, 12 Kempâs ridley hatchlings became trapped by a sand ridge created by heavy equipment cleaning the beach on North Padre Island, Texas in 2002 and were later crushed and killed by passing vehicles (Shaver 2004). The presence of artificial lighting on or near the beach adversely affects both nesting and hatchling sea turtles (Witherington and Martin 1996). Mortality from misdirection by artificial lighting on both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of Florida kills thousands of loggerhead hatchlings each year (Witherington 1997). The proportion of all emerging loggerhead hatchlings that died because of beach lighting was estimated in the early 1990s to be as high as 5â10 % (Witherington et al. 1996). Loggerheads abort nesting attempts at a greater frequency in lighted areas. Artificial lighting also deters females from emerging from the ocean to nest (Witherington 1986, 1992). Hatchling orientation of nests located at 23 representative beaches in six Florida counties was surveyed in 1993 and 1994, and approximately 10â30 % of nests showed evidence of hatchling disorientation by lighting (Witherington et al. 1996). Similar to other nocturnal nesting sea turtles, nesting leatherbacks and hatchlings can be disoriented by artificial lighting on the beach (NMFS 2011b). A significant negative relationship was found between sea turtle nesting density and distance from the nearest of 17 ocean inlets (Witherington et al. 2005). Beach instability from both erosion and sand accretion may discourage sea turtle nesting, since the effect of inlets in lowering nesting density was found both updrift and downdrift of the inlets. When sea turtles emerged to nest in the presence of armoring structures, more returned to the water without nesting compared to turtles that emerged on nonarmored beaches (Mosier 1998; Mosier and Witherington 2002). Fewer sea turtles made nesting attempts on beaches fronted by seawalls than on adjacent beaches where armoring structures were absent (Mosier 1998). In addition, sea turtles on armored sections of beach had a tendency to wander great distances as compared to turtles that emerged to nest on adjacent natural beaches (Mosier 1998). Since oil exploration and production occurs south of Tamaulipas and Veracruz in Mexico and at PAIS in Texas, the Kempâs ridley nesting beaches, as well as the nesting turtles, eggs, and hatchlings, could be impacted by oil spills and related activities (NMFS et al. 2011). For example, in 1979, the Ixtoc I oil well blew out and caused a fire in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico. The nesting beach at Rancho Nuevo was affected by the Ixtoc I well blowout, and large amounts of oil were released daily into the Gulf of Mexico for several months. However, the oil reached the beach after the nesting season, and nesting females were not present. Also, a loaded supertanker, the Mega Borg, exploded near Galveston, Texas in 1990, causing more than 121,000 barrels of crude oil to be released into the Gulf of Mexico; sea turtles covered in oil were found after this spill (Yender and Mearns 2003). Oil spills have affected loggerhead nesting beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. In August 1993, approximately 350,000 gal of fuel oil spilled into Tampa Bay and washed onto nesting beaches in Pinellas County, Florida (Conant et al. 2009). Impacts to loggerheads resulting from the spill included 31 dead hatchlings, 176 oil-covered nests, and 2,177 eggs and hatchlings exposed to oil or disturbed by response activities (FDEP et al. 1997)."

The stranding of sea turtles is caused by many factors, including incidental capture in shrimping and fishing operations, entanglement, ingestion of marine debris, boat strikes, disease, storms, and hypothermic stunning. The STSSN was established in 1980 to collect information on and document strandings of live and dead sea turtles along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The area includes the coasts from Maine through Texas, as well as portions of the U.S. Caribbean (STSSN 2012).

Menhaden, brown shrimp, white shrimp, oysters, and blue crab combined accounted for 94 % of landings in the 2007â2009 period. NOAA Fisheries in its annual publication Fisheries Economics of the United States identifies Gulf key species additionally as crawfish, groupers, red snapper, mullets, stone crab, and tunas. The focus of this chapter being the northern Gulf (i.e., Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) means there was no need to include crawfish and stone crab claws. The former is a freshwater species of wild and aquaculture origins found in Louisiana. The latter is overwhelmingly a Florida fishery. Like stone crab, the vast majority of Gulf striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) catch is Florida based; representing over 70 % of the Gulf total. Alabama and Louisiana basically account for the remainder with Alabama the larger. Total Gulf landings averaged ten million pounds of striped mullets in the most recent period. This was down from the initial 1990â1992 period average of 26 million pounds. Dockside value fell from the initial periodâs level of $26.4 million to $5.7 million. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) landings in the Gulf for 2007â2009 increased to 35 % of the United States. The increase did not result from increased landings compared to elsewhere in the country. Rather, Gulf landings decreased (69 %) but landings other than the Gulf fell 78 %. Prices were favorable during 1990â2009 by almost doubling nationally. Gulf yellowfin prices followed the increase by the lesser amount of 50 %. The distribution of Gulf landings was very narrow. Louisiana received 77 % of the catch in 2007â2009, which represents an increase from the 46 % share in 1990â1992. The harvest of red snapper and grouper are subject to increasingly constraining catch regulations of the GMFMC and cooperating states. Management of commercial effort by seasonal, gear, area protections and quotas with share assignment has the near-term effect of constraining catch. Additionally, these key species have been highly prized by anglers throughout the Gulf. Commercial red snapper average landings were essentially unchanged on the basis of an initial-period versus end-period measure at 2.6 million pounds. The 1995â2006 period average was 4.5 million pounds. Location of landings changed among the states between initial and end periods. Northern Gulf states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi experienced a 50 % decrease. Texas and Florida west coast benefitted with the 1990â1992 average of 1.2 million pounds, increasing to 1.9 million pounds by 2007â2009. Gag (Mycteroperca microlepis), red (Epinephelus morio), and warsaw grouper (Epinephelus nigritus) landings have consistently been attributable to Florida west coast ports. Thus, there are landings of some groupers in the northern Gulf, but these cannot be considered important compared to previously reviewed species."
34,817,0.615,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","In the Gulf of Mexico, Kempâs ridleys rarely interact with, or are incidentally captured in low numbers by fisheries, other than shrimp trawling. From 1994 through 2006, 11 Kempâs ridleys were incidentally captured during 4,096 trips of the Mexican pelagic longline tuna fishery (Ramirez and Ania 2000; J. Molina, Instituto Nacional de Pesca, personal communication, 2007, cited in NMFS et al. 2011). No Kempâs ridleys were observed as bycatch for the U.S. shark bottom longline fishery in the Gulf from 1994 through 2002 or from July 2005 through 2010 (Hale and Carlson 2007; NMFS et al. 2011). In the Gulf of Mexico bottom longline fishery for shark, grouper, snapper, tilefish, and reef fish, no Kempâs ridleys were observed incidentally captured from 2005 through 2010 (Hale and Carlson 2007; Hale et al. 2009; NMFS et al. 2011). In the gill net fisheries operating off the U.S. Gulf Coast, no Kempâs ridleys were observed taken from 2000 through 2008, and only one Kempâs ridley, which was released alive and uninjured, was incidentally captured in 2009 (Garrison 2007; Baremore et al. 2007; Passerotti and Carlson 2009; Passerotti et al. 2010). Kempâs ridleys are caught in both commercial and recreational hook-and-line fisheries along the U.S. Gulf Coast (Cannon et al. 1994; Seney 2008; NMFS et al. 2011). From 1980 through 1992, 112 Kempâs ridleys interacted with recreational hook-and-line gear at piers along the Texas coast, with 39 turtles documented in 1992 alone; 62 of these live captures were between the Bolivar Peninsular in Galveston County and the Texas-Louisiana border, and 63 % of the Kempâs ridleys were turtles that had been head-started (Cannon et al. 1994). These turtles, which were primarily juveniles ranging in size from 25 to 45 cm (9.8 to 17.7 in) SCL, represented a cost-effective means of gathering important Kempâs ridley data, while providing an opportunity for rehabilitation, if necessary (Seney 2008). A total of 170 Kempâs ridley hook-and-line encounters, which included 154 live captures, was recorded along the upper Texas coast from 1980 through 1995, with almost 90 % (135 turtles) occurring from 1992 through 1995 (C.W. Caillouet, NOAA NMFS, unpublished memo, 1996, cited in Seney 2008). The increased reports of hook-and-line captures during the mid-1990s may have been due to public education efforts targeting anglers, better survival of juvenile Kempâs ridleys due to shrimping regulations, and/or the initial stages of recovery exhibited by the overall population (Cannon et al. 1994; Cannon 1995; Lewison et al. 2003). From 2003 through 2007, 42 Kempâs ridleys, with an average size of 34.6 cm (13.6 in) SCL, were captured on hook and line along the upper Texas coast in Galveston (45 turtles) and Jefferson (two turtles) counties (Seney 2008). Most of the captures (74 %) were reported from a single pier on Galveston Island. No hatchling or oceanic juveniles (less than 25 cm [9.8 in] SCL) or subadults and adults (greater than 45 cm [17.7 in] SCL) were captured on hook and line, which was similar to what occurred for Kempâs ridleys caught on hook and line along the Florida Panhandle from 1991 through 2003 (Rudloe and Rudloe 2005). However, in contrast to the ridleys caught on hook and line at piers in the Florida Panhandle, the Kempâs ridleys caught by hook and line along the upper Texas coast demonstrated low site fidelity. The hook-and-line captures were retrieved between March and October, with 81 % occurring from April through June. Forty of the hook-and-line captures were successfully rehabilitated and released (Seney 2008)."

It has been proposed that such wide fluctuations are due to environmentally constrained primary productivity, which regulates energy budgets of this herbivorous turtle (Broderick et al. 2001). In the Florida Panhandle, green turtles nest along Eglin Air Force Base on Santa Rosa Island; 16 and 14 nests were laid in 1994 and 1996, respectively, while no nests were recorded in 1995 or 1997 (Lamont et al. 1998). This small nesting population also displays the annual nesting fluctuations characteristic of green turtle rookeries mentioned above. Green turtles also nest on the low-relief mangrove islands located in the Ten Thousand Islands in southwest Florida (Foley et al. 2000). From 1993 through 2002, the number of green turtle nests laid on Mexican beaches ranged from about 1,000 to over 7,000, with a high recorded in 2,000 of more than 7,200 nests, representing approximately 2,570 nesting females (Figure 11.31). Interannual fluctuations in green turtle nesting are also apparent for the Mexican Gulf coast (Figure 11.31). A summary of nesting data on Mexican beaches from 1993 through 2002 indicated that most green turtles nested in the state of Quintana Roo, followed by Veracruz, YucataÌn, Campeche, and Tamaulipas, with an estimated mean annual total of 1,430, 730, 633, 535, and 141 nests, respectively (MaÌrquez-M 2004). Daily nesting beach reconnaissance efforts along the YucataÌn Peninsula indicates that green turtle nesting has increased. In the early 1980s, approximately 875 nests per year were laid; by 2000, nesting had increased to more than 1,500 nests per year (Instituto Nacional de Pesca unpublished data cited in NMFS and USFWS 2007c). By 2004, about 1,547 females were estimated to nest on YucataÌn Peninsula beaches (IUCN 2004). From 2002 through 2004, green turtle nesting activity at El Cuyo Beach, located within the RÄ±Ìo Lagartos Biosphere Reserve on the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico, was evaluated (Xavier"

Growth and diet information obtained from recaptured and stranded turtles indicated that head-started ridleys adapted to feeding in the wild. Mortality rates were likely high for both wild-stock and head-started ridleys before the mandatory use of TEDs began in U.S. offshore waters in 1990, as indicated by the continued decline of Kempâs ridleys throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, because Kempâs ridley mortality was so high during the 1980s, survival to adulthood was unlikely for most turtles (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). Although factors, such as insufficient monitoring of the nesting beaches and turtle tag loss, have affected the collection of head-started Kempâs ridley nesting data, some head-started Kempâs ridleys have nested on beaches of PAIS, North Padre Island, Mustang Island, Galveston Island, and Bolivar Peninsula in Texas, as well as in Tamaulipas, Mexico (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). The first head-started Kempâs ridley nests, laid by turtles from the 1983 and 1986 year classes, were documented at PAIS and Boca Chica Beach, Texas in 1996 (Shaver 1996; Fontaine and Shaver 2005; Shaver and Wibbels 2007). The Kempâs ridleys that have nested in Texas since 1996 have been a mixture of head-started and wild-stock turtles. However, since 2002, the majority of nesting in Texas has been by wild-stock Kempâs ridleys (NMFS et al. 2011). For example, of the 42 Kempâs ridley nests documented in Texas in 2004, 13 were from head-started turtles (Safina and Wallace 2010). Tracking studies have demonstrated that nesting headstarted Kempâs ridleys have similar post-nesting movement behaviors as wild-stock ridleys (Landry and Seney 2006; Shaver and Wibbels 2007). Because the Head Start Experiment was a large-scale experiment on the most endangered sea turtle in the world and was the subject of intense debate and controversy throughout the 1980s and early 1990s (Shaver and Wibbels 2007), it was officially terminated in 1993 but continued on a limited basis through 2000. While it is encouraging that some head-started Kempâs ridleys have survived to maturity and are nesting, it is not possible to accurately determine the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the experiment (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). However, head-started females have nested and viable second-generation hatchlings have been produced both at PAIS and at Rancho Nuevo. In addition, a large amount of biological information was obtained as a result of the Head Start Experiment that might otherwise have never been discovered (Fontaine and Shaver 2005)."

Interestingly, their cross-correlation analyses suggest the propagation of a climate signal from SST through decapod larvae, adult crabs and lesser black-backed gulls with lags that match the biology of each trophic group. This is indicative of climate-induced changes in the marine fauna extending to the avian fauna, and thus to the terrestrial food web around the seabird colonies (Luczak et al. 2012). Case Study 5: Vulnerability of the seabird community in the western North Sea to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Most seabird studies have tended to consider the impacts of single stressors on single species at speciï¬c times of the year, and so may be unrepresentative of the combined effects of pressures experienced by top predator communities over an annual cycle (Burthe et al. 2014). For marine top predators, there is evidence to suggest that interactions between climate and other threats may be additive (Frederiksen et al. 2004b; Burthe et al. 2014). Burthe et al. (2014) studied the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a community of seabirds in the North Sea. More precisely, they examined vulnerability to climate change and other anthropogenic threats in a seabird community (45 species; 11 families) that used the Forth and Tay region (eastern Scotland) of the North Sea for breeding, overwintering or migration between 1980 and 2011. They found only 13 % of the seabird community in the Forth and Tay region to fall within the categories of low or very low population concern to future warming, whereas in considering multiple anthropogenic threats 73 % of the species in this bird community were considered to be of high or very high population concern for the future (Burthe et al. 2014). Case Study 6: Effects of extreme climatic events on coastal birds breeding in low-lying saltmarshes (for a more extensive review see Chap. 9). Van de Pol et al. (2010) investigated whether the frequency, magnitude and timing of rare but catastrophic flooding events have changed over time in Europeâs largest estuary, the Wadden Sea. They subsequently quantiï¬ed how this had affected the flooding risk of six saltmarsh nesting bird species (both seabird species and coastal species). Maximum high tide has increased twice as fast as mean high tide over the past four decades, resulting in more frequent and more catastrophic flooding of nests, especially around the time when most eggs have just hatched. By using data on speciesâ nest elevations, on the timing of egg-laying and on the length of time that the eggs and chicks are at risk from flooding, van de Pol et al. (2010) showed that flood risk increased for all six species (even after accounting for compensatory land accretion) and that this could worsen in the near future if the species do not adapt. This study provides the ï¬rst evidence that increasing flooding risks have reduced the reproductive output below stable population levels in at least one species, the Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus.

Environmental conditions including water temperature, salinity, and turbidityâin conjunction with the life cycles of many of the species that inhabit the Gulfâall contribute to availability. Species availability, in conjunction with those economic conditions that determine whether a trip will be profitable, including the price received for the harvested product and the cost of inputs used in the harvesting process, provide signals to the harvesting units as to whether a trip will be financially viable. This viability along with the multitude of regulations that can also govern fishing patterns influences fishing effort, and ultimately the catch. Considering this, landings of a specific year cannot be descriptive of Gulf fisheries from either a biological or economic viewpoint. For this chapter, the 20-year period from 1990 to 2009 was chosen as inclusive of (1) pre- and post-management agency changes, (2) active tropical storm periods, (3) challenging production cost situations, and (4) high and low points in the national economy. This approach acknowledges that a speciesâ stock level and economic conditions of inputs and demand play roles in landings levels. This perspective conveys a need to avoid reference to beginning-year and end-year comparisons. Rather, a 3-year average was used to depict landings and associated value as the beginning and end focus of comments. There is a distinction between location of landings and location of catch. This is particularly the case for the shrimp fisheries and most finfish. Location of catch is best documented for Gulf shrimp fisheries by offshore zones east to west across the Gulf and by inshore versus offshore. When data are available to differentiate landings from catch, that data is reported in the sections dealing with key species. Data by state are also reported in the key species sections."

Age plays a significant role in pinnipeds, as younger seals are more often entangled than adults (Lucas 1992; Henderson 2001; Hofmeyr et al. 2006). Gannets and many other seabird species use seaweed to build their nests, but are known to frequently incorporate ropes, nets and other anthropogenic debris (Podolski and Kress 1989; Montevecchi 1991; Hartwig et al. 2007; Votier et al. 2011; Bond et al. 2012; Lavers et al. 2013; Verlis et al. 2014) (Fig. 4.1). Marine debris used in nest construction increases the risk of mortal entanglement for both adult birds and chicks (Fig. 4.1). In three of the six North American gannet populations, close to 75 % of the gannet nests contained fishing debris. Its frequency can be linked to the level of gillnet fishing effort in the waters around the colonies (Bond et al. 2012)."

230,118,0.596,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract In this review we report new findings concerning interaction between marine debris and wildlife. Deleterious effects and consequences of entanglement, consumption and smothering are highlighted and discussed. The number of species known to have been affected by either entanglement or ingestion of plastic debris has doubled since 1997, from 267 to 557 species among all groups of wildlife. For marine turtles the number of affected species increased from 86 to 100 % (now 7 of 7 species), for marine mammals from 43 to 66 % (now 81 of 123 species) and for seabirds from 44 to 50 % of species (now 203 of 406 species). Strong increases in records were also listed for fish and invertebrates, groups that were previously not considered in detail. In future records of interactions between marine debris and wildlife we recommend to focus on standardized data on frequency of occurrence and quantities of debris ingested. In combination with dedicated impact studies in the wild or experiments, this will allow more detailed assessments of the deleterious effects of marine debris on individuals and populations.

Thus, gulls, ducks and waders can play important roles in the mass and energy fluxes of food webs, as well as in food web control (Moreira 1997; Eybert et al. 2003).

For some species, there are estimates of current population sizes, and perhaps trends in populations. From this review, however, it is clear that even for the key indicator species or groups, current data on population sizes for the entire Gulf are usually sparse. No Gulf-wide surveys are taken at the same time using the same methodology. However, even if sufficient surveys of populations for key species were available, this information does not necessarily provide a picture of the health of the system, predict emergent ecosystem problems, or predict future trends. This is especially true for the Gulf of Mexico because of both short-term (storms, hurricanes, tides, pollution, habitat loss, human disturbance) and long-term stressors (habitat loss, subsidence, global climate change, sea level rise). Detailed information about trophic levels, food web interactions, energy flow, and forcing functions are needed to predict emerging ecosystem change (Brown et al. 2006). This information is not available for the Gulf ecosystem, although the chapters in this series begin to bring together some of this information. However, sufficient information is available to support an integrated weight of evidence evaluation of the health of avian populations in the Gulf of Mexico. The available database includes (1) natural history information (age of first breeding, clutch size, incubation period, parental-care period, and life span); (2) status and trends for key indicator species or species groups; (3) effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on habitat use, and; (4) effects of social interactions (predators, competitors) on habitat use. These factors provide information on whether populations can recover quickly or not. Information on long-term recoveries is available for the species that were devastated during the plume-hunting days of the late 1800s to the early 1900s (herons, egrets, terns), or by exposure to pesticides (Osprey, Brown Pelican), which provides insights into recovery potential. Finally, the long-term sustainability of bird populations in the Gulf is a matter of"

The netting surveys were conducted primarily at Sabine Pass, Texas, and at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, as well as secondarily near the Mermentau River, Louisiana, from April through October 1993 through 2002. During the 10-year study, 600 Kempâs ridleys were captured, ranging in size from 19.5 to 66.3 cm (7.7 to 26.1 in) SCL; all annual mean size values were between 30 and 40 cm (11.8 and 15.7 in) SCL. Of all Kempâs ridleys captured during the study, 77 % were between 20 and 40 cm (7.9 and 15.7 in) SCL, about 20 % were between 40 and 60 cm (15.7 and 23.6 in) SCL, and 2 % were larger than 60 cm (23.6 in) SCL (Metz 2004). The size of Kempâs ridleys at Sabine Pass ranged from 19.5 to 64 cm (7.7 to 25.2 in) SCL, and no turtles larger than 55 cm (21.7 in) SCL were captured after 1998. Turtles captured at Calcasieu Pass were significantly larger and ranged in size between 22.4 and 66.3 cm (8.8 and 26.1 in) SCL. Most likely in response to rising water temperatures and seasonal occurrence of blue crab prey, the overall monthly Kempâs ridley catch per unit effort (CPUE) peaked from April through June during the 10-year study in northwestern Gulf of Mexico nearshore waters (Metz 2004). The annual mean ridley CPUE across all study areas peaked in 1994, 1997, 1999, and 2002, which suggested a 2- to 3-year cycle in abundance that could be related to temporal patterns in clutch size or hatch success at the Rancho Nuevo nesting beach resulting from variability in nesting female fecundity and the remigration interval (Metz 2004). However, there was no significant relationship between Kempâs ridley CPUE in nearshore Texas and Louisiana waters and the number of hatchlings leaving the nesting beaches at Rancho Nuevo. In fact, juvenile ridley CPUE remained relatively constant or decreased slightly, even as the number of hatchlings released from Rancho Nuevo increased exponentially. Assuming that post-hatchling mortality rates did not increase during the study period, juvenile Kempâs ridleys may have been recruiting to coastal locations outside of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico study areas (Metz 2004). The annual declines in strandings in Texas since 1994, along with the subsequent increases in Florida strandings since 1995, suggested that a shift in Kempâs ridley distribution from the western to the eastern Gulf of Mexico may have occurred in the mid-1990s, which could have been related to fluctuations in circulation patterns. Significant declines in turtle CPUE at Sabine Pass since 1997 coincided with a concurrent reduction in blue crab size; however, a similar trend was not seen at Calcasieu Pass. When evaluating various biological and abiotic factors, nesting dynamics and prey availability appeared to have had the most influence on the nearshore occurrence of Kempâs ridleys (Metz 2004). Hook-and-line captures data, stranding and nesting records, satellite telemetry, and diet analyses were used to characterize Kempâs ridley population dynamics and movements along the Texas coast from 2003 through 2007 (Seney 2008). The results of the analyses confirmed that Kempâs ridleys use the upper Texas coast and northwestern Gulf of Mexico throughout their life and that the region was used seasonally as developmental and nesting habitat, as well as a migration and foraging corridor. Recreational hook-and-line captures, which did not include oceanic juveniles or adults, made up about one-third of non-nesting encounters along the coasts of Galveston and Jefferson counties in Texas. Juveniles demonstrated a preference for habitat type or benthic prey concentrations, rather than specific locations, in the northwestern Gulf and were found in nearshore waters along the upper Texas coast primarily during the warmer months (March through October). They also entered inshore areas, such as bays and coastal lakes, along the Texas and Louisiana coasts (Seney 2008). Adult females that nested along the upper Texas coast occupied the region during the nesting season (April through July). Juvenile and internesting adults occurred in relatively shallow Texas state waters, and postnesting females subsequently migrated through deeper, federal waters (Seney 2008)."

In 2010 and 2011, 683 and 970 nests, respectively, were recorded for northern Gulf of Mexico loggerheads, and a high of 1,750 nests was recorded in 2012 (FFWCC FWRI 2012; Share the Beach 2013). The Dry Tortugas subpopulation is the smallest loggerhead subpopulation of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (Figure 11.17) (TEWG 2009). This subpopulation is important not only for its genetic distinctiveness but also because it is isolated from many of the threats facing most sea turtle nesting areas (van Houtan and Pimm 2007). Loggerhead nesting activity is unevenly distributed among the seven islands within Dry Tortugas National Park (DTNP). About 90 % of loggerhead nests are laid on East Key and Loggerhead Key each year; the remaining 10 % of nesting activity occurs on Bush Key, Hospital Key, and Garden Key, and virtually no nesting occurs on Long Key and Middle Key (van Houtan and Pimm 2007). Annual nest counts for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation of loggerheads from 1995 through 2001 consistently exceeded 200 (about 40 nesting females) with a high of 340 nests recorded in 1995 (Figure 11.20). About 200 nests were also recorded for the Dry Tortugas in 2003 and 2009. A longer time series of nesting data for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation is necessary in order to detect a trend (NMFS and USFWS 2008). The majority of nesting for the Greater Caribbean subpopulation of loggerhead sea turtles occurs in Quintana Roo, Mexico. The loggerhead nesting aggregation in Quintana Roo is the third largest in the western north Atlantic (Figure 11.17) (Ehrhart et al. 2003; TEWG 2009).

Nesting surveys along the Texas coast, which have increased in recent years, have been extremely challenging due to the hundreds of kilometers of beaches that must be searched, limited resources, and logistical difficulties, and because of the nesting characteristics of Kempâs ridleys (e.g., nesting during the day on windy days) (Shaver and Rubio 2008). Eggs from nests found on many of the Texas beaches are moved to incubation facilities or protective corrals. While fewer than ten nests were recorded each year (for years for which data are available) prior to 1997, the number of nests on Texas beaches began to increase in 1998. Since 2006, more than 100 Kempâs ridley nests or at least 40 nesting Kempâs ridleys have been recorded for Texas beaches each year (Figure 11.12). In 2010, 141 nests were recorded along the Texas coast, and 199 nests were recorded in 2011 (NPS 2013a). A record number of 209 Kempâs ridley nests, representing about 84 nesting females, was recorded along the Texas coast in 2012 (NPS 2013b), and 153 nests were recorded during the 2013 nesting season (NPS 2013a). With increased productivity on the nesting beaches and improved survival at sea because of reductions in fishing mortality, conservation efforts boosted the current population of Kempâs ridleys from 7,000 to 8,000 breeding females nesting at multiple sites from Padre Island, Texas, to Veracruz in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Crowder and Heppell 2011)."

Fish species differ widely in their ability to adapt to changes in the biotic and abiotic environment in the Gulf of Mexico; omnipresent species are the most robust in adapting to changes in habitat. There is large spatiotemporal variability in key life-history parameters (e.g., growth and maturation) for many Gulf of Mexico fish species. Many fish species in the Gulf are often considered a unit fish stock, which implicitly assumes adequate Gulf-wide mixing for fisheries stock assessment and management, even though evidence suggests complex stock structure within the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., existence of meta-population or local populations as a result of spatial isolations). A wide variety of short-term and long-term anthropogenic and natural stressors, such as rapid coastal development, pollution, heavy fishing, climate change, and natural disasters, have reduced the resilience and robustness of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem with respect to human and natural perturbations. Different fish species tend to respond to fishing and changes in habitat in different ways. Some species are more sensitive, and others are more robust with respect to changes in fishing mortality and habitat. High fishing pressure and degraded environment have changed key life-history parameters of important fish species in the Gulf of Mexico, e.g., reduced size at age and earlier maturation, reduced stock reproductive potential, increased temporal fluctuation of recruitment, and impaired ability of fish stocks to recover from low stock abundance."

The Gulf of Mexico provides critical spawning grounds for many highly migratory fish and shark species of great ecological, commercial, and recreational importance. Only a small fraction (4.6 %) of finfish is endemic to the Gulf of Mexico, although some fish species of commercial and recreational importance can complete their entire life cycle within the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.

They are widely distributed in coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and experience seasonal inshoreâoffshore movements, usually leaving inshore waters in October and November for warm offshore waters and moving back into inshore waters in spring. These species tend to be smaller than 150 cm (59 in.) TL and have a maximum life span of less than 12 years. They become sexually mature at relatively young ages (2â3 years old), with males often maturing sooner than females. The reproductive cycle is usually annual within the Gulf of Mexico, with an average litter size ranging from 3 to 10 pups. One single stock is assumed in the assessment.

The only other turtle that is larger than the green turtle is the leatherback sea turtle (Witherington et al. 2006b). The green turtle was named for the green cartilage found under its shell (Witzell 1994); other names given to this turtle include edible turtle and soup turtle (Hirth 1997). The green sea turtle has been studied for centuries (Pritchard 2010). They were the first species for which a conservation and research program was established; this occurred in Tortuguero, Costa Rica, in 1955 and was the first of its kind in the world (Carr et al. 1978; Carr 1979). The Tortuguero program, which was started by the Caribbean Conservation Corporation (now known as the Sea Turtle Conservancy), continues today. Much of what is known about the biology of green sea turtles, as well as other sea turtle species, has been learned on the beaches of Tortuguero."

230,143,0.569,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"concluded, that pursuit-diving birds have the highest frequency of plastic uptake, followed by surface-seizing and dipping seabirds. Provencher et al. (2010) reported that marine birds, feeding on crustaceans and cephalopods had ingested more plastic than piscivorous seabirds, and those omnivores are most likely to confuse prey and plastic. Seabirds with specialized diets are less likely to misidentify plastic, unless a particular type resembles their prey (Ryan 1987). Many gull species frequent rubbish bins and landfill areas, in addition to foraging in marine habitats and seem prone to ingest debris. However, ingested debris does not often show up in their stomachs during dissections because they clear them daily by regurgitating hard prey remains (Hays and Cormons 1974; Ryan and Fraser 1988; Lindborg et al. 2012). As regurgitation takes place regularly, plastics quantified from boluses reflect the ingestion of the very last period, rather than accumulated debris (Camphuysen et al. 2008; Ceccarelli 2009; Codina-GarcÃ­a et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2013). Tubenosed seabirds mostly retain plastic and hard prey items (Mallory 2006) because they possess two stomachs with a constriction (Isthmus gastris) between the glandular proventriculus and the muscular gizzard (Furness 1985; Ryan and Jackson 1986). Even when spitting stomach oil to defend themselves or when feeding their chicks, only plastics from the proventriculus are regurgitated but items from the gizzard are retained (Rothstein 1973). Marine turtles frequently ingest plastic bags as they may mistake them for jellyfish, a common component of their diet (Carr 1987; Lutz 1990; Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Tourinho et al. 2010; Townsend 2011; Campani et al. 2013; Schuyler et al. 2014). While accidental plastic ingestion by filter-feeding baleen whales (Mysticeti) might be assumed to be common, Walker and Coe (1990) expected that toothed whales (Odontoceti) would have a low rate of plastic ingestion because they use echolocation or visual cues to locate their prey. However, Laist (1997), Simmonds (2012) and Baulch and Perry (2014) all made extensive descriptions of toothed whales that had ingested plastic. Indeed, our updated literature search showed that 54 and 62 % of the baleen and toothed whales, respectively, ingest plastics. It has also been suggested, that marine mammals could see plastic as a curiosity and while investigating it, they swallow it or become entrapped (Mattlin and Cawthorn 1986; Laist 1987). Large predatory fishes and birds are known to frequently inspect plastic debris and take bites out of larger plastic items. CadÃ©e (2002) observed that 80 % of foamed plastic debris on the Dutch coast showed peckmarks of birds and suggested that the birds mistake polystyrene foam for cuttlebones or other food. Carson et al. (2013) observed bite marks of sharks or large predatory fishes on 16 % of plastic debris beached on Hawaii indicating âtestingâ of materials. Choy and Drazen (2013) showed that among 595 individuals of seven such large predatory fish species, 19 % of individuals (range per species <1â58 %) had actually ingested plastic. Foraging strategies may vary under different conditions of food availability. Duguy et al. (2000) considered that decreased availability of jellyfish during winter could be the reason for the higher incidence of plastic bags during these months in the diet of turtles. In conclusion it seems that although indiscriminate omnivorous predators or filter feeders appear most prone to plastic ingestion, there are many examples of"

In general, there was a large amount of consistency between most commonly caught (A + B1 + B2) recreational species in Florida when comparing 1995 and 2009 (Tables 10.16 and 10.19), with no observed changes in ranking among the top five species. Furthermore, while large increases in the catches of scaled sardines and Atlantic thread herring were observed between the 2005 and 2009 periods, catches of the other three top five species (pinfish, spotted seatrout, and gray snapper) remained relatively constant. With respect to harvest (A + B1), four of the five most commonly harvested species in 1995 remained among the five most commonly harvested species in 2009 with only white grunt (Haemulon plumierii) falling out of the ranking and Spanish mackerel replacing it. This change in positioning reflects both a sharp decline in the estimated harvest of white grunt (from 2.8 million fish in 1995 to 1.2 million fish in 2009) and a doubling in the harvest of Spanish mackerel (from 658,000 fish to 1.4 million fish).

Management, however, is a complex mix of actions (dredging, hydrological control, diking, wetlands for aquaculture) aimed at improving the coastal environment for people, actions to improve ecosystem structure and function (e.g., terracing), and actions to aid particular species groups (burning for waterfowl habitat). There are management programs to restore large ecosystems in place as part of the larger Gulf of Mexico system. For example, a massive federal and state effort to restore the Everglades ecosystem features many of the prominent Gulf of Mexico species, such as White Ibis, Roseate Spoonbill, and other colonial-nesting species (Ogden et al. 2003, 2005; Frederick and Collopy 1989; Gawlik 2006). Managing for birds is difficult because it often involves trade-offs whereby a given action is positive for one species, but negative for another. Several examples have been provided in this chapter: (1) differences in salinity (affected by water control) favor some marsh species over others; (2) vegetation removal is positive for bare-sand nesting species, but not for those requiring some sparse or dense vegetation; and (3) large expanses of bare sand may encourage larger terns to nest, forcing smaller terns (e.g., Least Tern) out of otherwise optimal habitat. Many agencies and organizations are devoted to protection and conservation of birds in general, and of coastal waterbirds in particular (e.g., SE U.S. Regional Waterbird Conservation Plan, Hunter et al. 2006; U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, USFWS 2004; U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan for Lower Mississippi/Western Gulf Coast, GCPWG 2000). There are plans for particular species, such as the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Recovery Plans and 5-year reviews for the Piping Plover (USFWS 1999, 2003, 2009b), and the Whooping Crane Recovery Program (USFWS 1986, 2012c). Canadian provinces also produce plans for species of concern, such as the Piping Plover (White and McMaster 2005). Status reports have been developed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for groups of birds, such as seabirds (Fritts and Reynolds 1981; Fritts et al. 1983), waterfowl (USFWS 2011), and waterbirds (Anderson et al. 1996). There are also status reports for individual species, such as Red Knot (Niles et al. 2008), American Oystercatcher (Clay et al. 2010), and Black Skimmer"

A study by Eckert (2002) indicated that juvenile leatherbacks were found exclusively in waters warmer than 26  C, but larger juveniles and subadults would venture into waters as cold as 8  C. Leatherbacks, therefore, spend the first portion of their lives in tropical waters, venturing into cooler latitudes only after reaching a size of 97 cm (38.2 in) SCL (Eckert 2002; Avens et al. 2009). The restriction of smaller leatherbacks to warmer waters suggests that size may play a role in the ability of the species to exist in colder waters. The warm water restrictions also suggest that the onset of thermogenerating capability, which is not found in younger or smaller turtles, occurs after reaching a size of about 97 cm (38.2 in) SCL (Eckert 2002)."

Because of the limited nesting distribution, as well as the collaborative United Statesâ Mexican recovery program (see Section 11.2.2), an entire time series of nesting information, beginning in 1966, is available for the Kempâs ridley for Rancho Nuevo and the adjacent beaches. This time series of information has little uncertainty after 1978, when nest protection methods became standardized and almost all nests were moved to a hatchery and recorded; however, since the mid-1990s, the level of uncertainty in estimating the population size has increased because of spatial expansion of the population and increased protection efforts (MaÌrquez-M. et al. 1999; Heppell et al. 2007). While more than 40,000 Kempâs ridleys were estimated to nest at Rancho Nuevo during an arribada in one day in 1947 (Carr 1963; Hildebrand 1963), only 924 nests were documented in 1978, and a low of 702 nests was recorded in 1985, representing about 300 and 228 nesting females, respectively (Figure 11.11). The number of nests observed at Rancho Nuevo and nearby beaches began to increase during the late 1980s and continued to increase at a rate of about 15 % per year (Figure 11.11) (Heppell et al. 2005; Crowder and Heppell 2011). In addition, the geographic range of nesting has expanded to the north and south of Rancho Nuevo (Heppell et al. 2007). Since 2005, the number of nests recorded in the Rancho Nuevo area each year"

Frederiksen et al. (2006) also demonstrated consistent trends across four trophic levels, from plankton to seabirds, in the North Sea but again the causal links were undeï¬ned. Thompson and Ollason (2001) showed how ocean climate variation had lagged effects on a Scottish pelagic seabird species through cohort differences in recruitment related to temperature changes in summer. Burthe et al. (2012) compared phenological trends for species from four levels of a North Sea food web over the period 1983â2006 when SST increased signiï¬cantly. The results suggest trophic mismatch between ï¬ve seabird species breeding in the North Sea and their sandeel prey, but no evidence of an impact on the seabird breeding success or population dynamics (Burthe et al. 2012). Also, the signiï¬cant increase in the number of lesser black-backed gulls from 1996 onwards has been linked to the earlier mentioned temperature-driven increase in recruitment of swimming crabs in wide areas of the southern North Sea. These crabs are a key prey item for the seagulls (Luczak et al. 2012)."
34,551,0.562,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","10.4.2.1.5 Aggregate Gulf of Mexico Recreational Catch/Harvest The estimated annual number of fish caught (A + B1 + B2) throughout the Gulf (excluding Texas) for the 1990â2009 period is given in Figure 10.64 (left panel). The total catch (by all anglers and modes) generally ranged from about 130 million fish per year to 190 million fish per year and averaged about 155 million fish per year during the 20-year period of analysis. While exhibiting considerable year-to-year variation, there is little or no long-run discernible trend in annual catch estimates in number of fish, with a possible exception of an upward and permanent shift beginning in the late 1990s. This upward shift largely corresponds with the upward movement in number of trips (see Figure 10.61). The information in Figure 10.64 (left panel) also indicates that a large proportion of the number of fish caught is released either alive or dead. Since 1990, more than one-half of the catch in numbers of fish has been released alive (B2) with no apparent long-run trend. The high release rate is the result of a number of factors. Factors include, but are not limited to, (1) many species caught are generally considered to be undesirable (e.g., saltwater catfish), (2) most desirable species now have minimum (and sometimes maximum) size limits with catch at size below (above) that limit required to be returned to the water, (3) there are seasons for many of the desirable species and catch of that species outside the designated season must be released, and (4) retention of some species considered to be severely overfished (e.g., goliath grouper) is prohibited. While there appears to have been an upward and permanent shift in the number of fish caught beginning in the late 1990s (Figure 10.64, left panel), there appears to be no corresponding increase in the number of fish caught per trip (Figure 10.64, right panel). This is because the increased catch beginning in the late 1990s coincided with an increase in the number of angler trips. Hence, the estimated catch per angler trip remained virtually constant. Focusing only on harvest (A + B1), the Gulf of Mexico recreational harvest (excluding Texas) averaged 73 million fish per year during the 20-year period ending in 2009 with a range from less than 50 million in 1990 to 100 million in 2006 (Figure 10.65, left panel). During the decade of the 1990s, the estimated annual harvest equaled 65 million fish per year with the figure increasing to 82 million fish per year during the most recent decade (2000â2009). With few exceptions, the number of fish harvested per trip consistently fell in the relatively narrow range of three fish to four fish with no observable trend (Figure 10.65, right panel).

At the northern and southern extremes of their distribution, Atlantic sailfish occur only in the warmer months. The seasonal changes in distribution may be linked to prey migrations. The rates of Atlantic sailfish bycatch in the pelagic longline fisheries are two times higher in the Gulf of Mexico than in other areas of the North Atlantic during the spawning season, from May through September (De Sylva and Breder 1997), suggesting that spawning biomass in the Gulf of Mexico tends to be higher than spawning biomass in other areas of the Atlantic. This suggests that the Gulf of Mexico provides an important spawning and larval habitat for Atlantic sailfish. Essential fish habitat has been designated for juvenile, adult, and spawning Atlantic sailfish. These habitats are described in Table 9.26 and shown in Figures 9.42, 9.43, 9.44, and 9.45."

231,1178,0.551,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"DBEM) were applied to the same present distribution datasets and the same environmental input parameters. As indicated by the test statistics, each method produced a plausible present distribution and estimate of habitats suitable for each species (14 commercial ï¬sh). When used to make projections into the future, the ensemble of models suggested northward shifts at an average rate of 27 km per decade (the current rate is around 20 km per decade for common ï¬sh in the North Sea, Dulvy et al. 2008). This modelling approach was extended to include several additional, commercial species (squid Loligo vulgaris, seabass, sardine, sprat, John dory, anchovy, plaice, herring, mackerel, halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus, red mullet etc.) as part of a Defra study (Defra 2013). The species predicted to move the furthest were anchovy, sardine, Greenland halibut, John dory and seabass (i.e. E. encrasicolus, S. pilchardus, R. hippoglossoides, Z. faber and D. labrax respectively, see Fig. 12.4). By contrast Rutterford et al. (2015) used the same ï¬sh survey datasets for the North Sea, together with generalised additive models (GAMs), to predict trends in the future distribution of species, but came to the conclusion that ï¬sh species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by the availability of suitable habitat in the North Sea, especially in terms of preferred depths. The authors found no consistent pattern among species in predicted changes in distribution. On the basis of the GAM results the authors suggested that they did not expect or predict substantial further deepening (as previously observed by Dulvy et al. 2008), and that the capacity of ï¬sh to remain in cooler water by changing their depth distribution had been largely exhausted by the 1980s, that ï¬sh with preferences for cooler water are being increasingly exposed to higher temperatures, with expected physiological, life history and negative population consequences. Beaugrand et al. (2011) described a model to map the future spatial distribution of Atlantic cod. The model, which they named the non-parametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN), suggested that cod may eventually disappear as a commercial species from some regions including the North Sea where a sustained decline has already been documented; in contrast, the abundance of cod is likely to increase in the Barents Sea. Lenoir et al. (2011) applied the same NPPEN model with multiple explanatory variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, and bathymetry) to predict the distribution of eight ï¬sh species up to the 2090s for the Northeast Atlantic. This study anticipated that by the 2090s horse mackerel and anchovy would show an increased probability of occurrence in northern waters compared with the 1960s, that pollack Pollachius pollachius, haddock and saithe would show a decrease in the south, and that turbot Scophthalmus maximus and sprat would show no overall change in probability (â0.2 to +0.2) anywhere."

Young (to age 8) red snapper in the eastern Gulf of Mexico tend to have a higher reproductive output at age compared to those in the western Gulf. A single stock of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico has been suggested by genetic studies (Camper et al. 1993; Gold et al. 1997; Heist and Gold 2000), which may result from the lack of sufficient time since the Pleistocene epoch for spatially separated substocks of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico to have become genetically distinct, or from enough mixing to maintain homogeneity in the population. However, phenotypic differences have been identified in growth, maturation, abundance, age/size compositions, prey compositions, and fishery dynamics between the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico. To account for such differences between the two areas in the stock assessment, the Gulf of Mexico red snapper stock is considered to consist of the two substocks. Although there is evidence of large differences in life history and population dynamics at fine spatial scales, such as among different reefs (Gallaway et al. 2009), more studies are needed to evaluate the potential existence of metapopulation structure."

DePaola et al. (1994) noted that the prevalence of V. vulnificus collected offshore in the Gulf (32â35 ppt) was 11.8 % compared with 13 % in Galveston open Gulf beaches (18.9 ppt) and 68 % in the Galveston Bay estuary (11.3 ppt). Tao et al. (2012) found that a statistically significant ( p < 0.0001) inverse correlation between V. vulnificus-positive fish and salinity existed as did a positive correlation ( p < 0.03) between water temperature and V. vulnificuspositive fish in Gulf locations of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, Gulf Shores and Dauphin Island, Alabama. In addition to the fish listed above by DePaola et al. (1994), Tao et al. (2012) also reported ladyfish (Elops saurus), striped mullet, silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), sand weakfish (Cynoscion arenarius), spotted weakfish (Cynoscion nebulosus), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) to have V. vulnificus on the body surface. Buck (1990) isolated V. alginolyticus, V. damselae, and V. parahaemolyticus from fish from the GoM and adjacent Sarasota Bay, Florida. These isolates came from the gills, intestinal tract, mouth, surface skin, spines, and teeth. Exophthalmia, a condition known as âbugeye,â commonly affects fishes in the GoM. The most common cause is bacterial as shown in the red snapper maintained in culture (Figure 14.14). Figure 14.15 shows a case in the sheepshead minnow that also was probably bacterial in nature. The condition, however, can result from a variety of causes. When a trematode metacercaria infects the eye, especially in a semi-enclosed locality, a large percentage of the fish intermediate host population can be infected. Several species of diplostomoids produce this effect, and some"

The species is relatively short lived and in 2009 age-2 fish comprised an estimated 73 % of the fleet harvest and age-1 fish comprised 13 % of the harvest (NMFS, Sustainable Fisheries Branch, Beaufort, NC, 2010). Overall, the percentage of age-2 fish comprising harvest has increased over time with reasons for this increase not clearly identified. Hypotheses include (1) contraction of the fishery over time from the extremes of the species range, Florida through Texas, where smaller fish were more abundant in Mississippi and Louisiana waters and (2) a redistribution of age-1 fish to more inside waters due to deterioration of wetlands (GSMFC meeting, Orange Beach, Alabama, 2010). Given that the majority of harvest comprises only a couple of year classes, environmental factors that influence recruitment significantly influence subsequent harvest. Citing Christmas et al. (1982) and Guillory et al. (1983), Deegan (1990) suggests that low winter temperatures, high salinities, and low turbidity during the period when the menhaden are in the estuaries are correlated with poor year-classes because of their"

However, the Gulf Coast is no longer the chief wintering area for North American waterfowl because of coastal marsh habitat loss, sea level rise, and freshwater inputs that have reduced available habitat (Palmisano 1973; Link et al. 2011). Such steep declines require intensive study, management of hunting and habitat, and possible additional protection for nocturnal roost sites (Link et al. 2011), as well as manipulation of water levels (Bolduc and Afton 2004). Even so, 19 % of waterfowl wintering in the United States use marshes of the Louisiana Gulf Coast (Michot 1996). Migratory waterfowl also concentrate in coastal Mexico (Gallardo et al. 2004). Texas is the top waterfowl harvest state in the Central Flyway and is in the top five hunting states in the United States Texas accounted for 42 % of the total duck harvest and 47 % of the goose harvest in the Central Flyway (TPWD 2011). Although the number of waterfowl hunters is declining nationally, Texas hunter trends have remained stable. Coastal habitat protection is a"

34,343,0.545,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","The Atlantic sharpnose shark is mainly distributed in waters from the Bay of Fundy to the Straits of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 13 2007). Even though no genetic differences were found (Heist et al. 1996), based on tagging and life-history studies, a two-stock hypothesis has been proposed: an Atlantic stock distributed from North Carolina to the Straits of Florida and a Gulf of Mexico stock from the Florida Keys throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Little mixing was found in tagging studies between these two stocks (SEDAR 13 2007), suggesting that the two stocks are rather independent. However, large differences have been observed in the life histories between samples collected from the two areas, which might have resulted from differences in the sampling times, locations, and habitats. Most catch of this species is from the Florida east coast, and a single working stock was assumed for the assessment (SEDAR 13 2007). The Atlantic sharpnose shark is the most common shark in the northern Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 13 2007). They tend to engage in seasonal inshoreâoffshore movement, leaving the coast in October and November for warmer offshore waters and returning in March and April. Most adult females tend to be found just offshore in deepwaters. It appears that there is sex and size segregation in the distribution of the population in the Gulf of Mexico (Parsons 2006). Young-of-the-year, juvenile, and adult Atlantic sharpnose sharks prefer sandy and seagrass bottoms, but also can be found on muddy grounds (Bethea et al. 2009). The shallow waters in the extensive barrier islands of the northern Gulf of Mexico are important Atlantic sharpnose shark pupping and nursery grounds. Age and growth of the Atlantic sharpnose shark in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico have been based on vertebral age analysis (Parsons 1983; Branstetter 1987; Carlson and Baremore 2003). The Atlantic sharpnose shark has a maximum length of about 107 cm (42.1 in.) and a maximum age of 11 years (Loefer and Sedberry 2003). Tagging studies, however, suggest that the maximum age should be 12 years. Nearly all females and males become sexually mature at the age of 2.5 years in the Gulf of Mexico and at age 3.5 in the South Atlantic. Peak mating activity occurs in June and July, and the gestation period is 10â12 months. Reproductive periodicity is annual for both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Fecundity is 4.1 pups per year, with pupping occurring in June. The annual survival rate is about 0.7 for age-1 sharks and slightly higher (around 0.75) for adults (SEDAR 13 2007)."

The Atlantic blue marlin is the most tropical of the billfishes and is a blue water fish that spends most of its life in the open sea (Tables 9.18 and 9.19). They rarely aggregate in schools and are usually found as scattered single individuals. Their distributional areas range from about latitude 45 N to about latitude 35 S (Table 9.20). Blue marlin are less abundant in the eastern Atlantic, where they mostly occur off Africa between the latitudes of 25 N and 25 S (NMFS 2009b). The distribution and movement patterns of Atlantic blue marlin within the Gulf of Mexico tend to vary among individuals. Some may spend considerable time within the Gulf of Mexico for feeding and spawning, while others move seasonally between the Gulf of Mexico and tropical areas, such as the Bahamas. A tagging study with pop-up archival transmitting tags in the Gulf of Mexico suggested that most tagged fish remained in the Gulf of Mexico, with some fish exhibiting egress into Belize (Caribbean Sea) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Kraus et al. 2011)."
231,1180,0.541,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Year-Class Strength and Implications for Fisheries Fishers and scientists have known for over 100 years that the status of ï¬sh stocks can be greatly influenced by prevailing climatic conditions (Hjort 1914; Cushing 1982). âRecruitmentâ variability is a key measure of stock productivity, and is deï¬ned as the number of juvenile ï¬sh surviving from the annual egg production to be exploited by the ï¬shery. Recruitment is critically dependent on the match or mismatch between the occurrence of the larvae and availability of their zooplankton food (Cushing 1990) as well as other processes that affect early life-history stages (see Petitgas et al. 2013). Empirical data on exploited populations often show strong relationships between recruitment success, ï¬sheries catches and climatic variables. These strong relationships have been demonstrated, for example, for cod (OâBrien et al. 2000; Brander and Mohn 2004; Cook and Heath 2005), plaice (Brunel and Boucher 2007), herring (Nash and Dickey-Collas 2005), mackerel (Jansen and Gislason 2011) and seabass (Pawson 1992). Correlations have been found between ï¬sh recruitment and various climate variables, including sea surface temperature, the NAO and even offshore winds (Table 12.2). A number of publications describing the impact of climate variability (e.g. the NAO and AMO) on small pelagic ï¬shes such as herring, anchovy or sardine in the North Sea have been published in recent years, for example those of Alheit et al. (2012) and GrÃ¶ger et al. (2010). According to the most recent assessment of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the NAO is one of the climate indices for which it is most difï¬cult to provide accurate future projections (IPCC 2013). Recent multi-model studies (e.g. Karpechko 2010) suggest overall that the NAO is likely to become slightly more positive (on average) in the future due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, a slight tendency towards enhanced recruitment and larval abundance of these species in the future could be expected if the relationships observed in the past continue to hold. In the case of cod, there is a well-established relationship between recruitment and sea temperature (OâBrien et al. 2000; Beaugrand et al. 2003), but this relationship varies with regard to the different cod stocks that inhabit the North Atlantic (Planque and FrÃ©dou 1999). For stocks at the northern extremes (e.g. in the Barents Sea) or the western Atlantic (e.g. Labrador), warming leads to enhanced recruitment, while in the North Sea, close to the southern limits of the range, warmer conditions lead to weaker than average year classes (Drinkwater 2005). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, cold conditions were correlated with a sequence of positive recruitment years in North Sea cod"
231,1181,0.54,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"and subsequently high ï¬sheries catches for a number of years thereafter (Heath and Brander 2001). In recent years however, despite several cold winters, cod have suffered very poor recruitment in the North Sea, although it is unclear whether this is a direct consequence of changed climatic conditions, reduced availability of planktonic prey items for larval ï¬sh or over-ï¬shing of the parental stock (i.e. some sort of âAllee effectâ) (Mieszkowska et al. 2009), or more intensive predation of cod larvae by pelagic ï¬sh stocks which have increased, such as herring and sprat (Engelhard et al. 2014a). A clear seasonal shift to earlier appearance ofï¬sh larvae has been described for several species at Helgoland Roads in the southern North Sea (Greve et al. 2005), and this has been linked to marked changes in zooplankton composition and sea surface temperature in this region (Beaugrand et al. 2002). In particular, there has been a decline in the abundance of the copepod Calanus ï¬nmarchicus but an increase in the closely related but smaller species C. helgolandicus. Calanus ï¬nmarchicus is a key prey item for cod larvae in the northern North Sea, and the loss of this species has been correlated with recent failures in cod recruitment and an apparent increase in flatï¬sh recruitment (Reid et al. 2001, 2003; Beaugrand et al. 2003). Calanus helgolandicus occur at the wrong time of the year to be of use to emerging cod larvae. Greve et al.

Most populations or subpopulations have not been well studied, with the most notable exceptions being those of the Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida, area (Wells 2003) and Sanibel Island (Shane 2004) of west Florida. Similarly, dolphin populations are known in the north-central Gulf (Mullin 1988) and off Texas (Shane 1977; Moreno 2005) as well, but none has been followed for as long or as thoroughly as the subject of the Wells (2003) study. Bottlenose dolphins of the inshore areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico number about 28â32 separate stocks (that are not necessarily distinguished as genetic populations), with an estimated total of 5,355 (no reliable CV available) animals (Table 13.22). Three coastal stocks outside of bays and estuaries and up to 20 m (66 ft) deep, total approximately 13,600 animals (see details, below). The northern continental shelf stock between 20 m and 200 m (66 ft and 656 ft) totals about 17,777 (CV 0.32). The northern oceanic stock deeper than 200 m (656 ft) totals about 3,708 (CV 0.42). Details of these groupings are given below. Anthropogenic influences on this species will be discussed, including toxins, noises, and other aspects, since more is known about these dolphins and their ecology than is known about other cetaceans in the Gulf, largely due to work by Randall Wells and colleagues, which is summarized in Reynolds et al.

Prior to the mid-1990s, the U.S. share of landings from the West Atlantic sailfish stock varied between 20 and 60 %, with an average of approximately 40 % (Figure 9.47). Beginning around 2000, landings in the United States and the U.S. share of landings dropped dramatically (Figures 9.46 and 9.47). This may reflect the fact that a targeted commercial fishery for Atlantic sailfish is prohibited in the Gulf of Mexico and other U.S. waters. The current Atlantic sailfish commercial catch is bycatch in pelagic longlines, which are commonly used in the Gulf of Mexico to target swordfish and yellowfin tuna. Atlantic sailfish are subject to domestic and international management regulations (Table 9.24). For the West Atlantic sailfish stock, the most recent stock assessment suggests that overfishing is probably occurring, and the stock may be overfished (Table 9.24) (ICCAT 2011b). However, because of the large uncertainty associated with the data and stock structure, the results are not conclusive. The recent stock assessment (ICCAT 2011b) suggests that the West Atlantic stock suffered great declines in abundance prior to 1990. However, since 1990, different abundance indices tend to suggest conflicting trends, with some indicating declines and others indicating increases or no trends (ICCAT 2011b)."

Considering either catch (A + B1 + B2) or harvest (A + B1) in the aggregate has only limited value because many of the species most frequently caught are done so with the express purpose of using the catch for bait in catching more desirable species. This is clearly illustrated with the help of the information in Tables 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14, and 10.15 where each table provides the 25 most commonly caught (A + B1 + B2) and harvested (A + B1) species for a given year (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2009). As indicated, many of the species either caught (A + B1 + B2) or harvested (A + B1) tend to be used primarily as bait or released because they are not considered edible. In 1990, for example, three of the four most commonly recreationally caught species in the Gulf of Mexico (scaled sardine [Harengula jaguana], gizzard shad [Dorosoma cepedianum], and pinfish [Lagodon rhomboids]) represent species primarily used for bait as too are Spanish sardine (Sardinella aurita) and Gulf menhaden. Many other speciesâincluding hardhead catfish (Arius felis), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), and ladyfish (Elops saurus)âare rarely kept because they are considered trash fish by a large proportion of the recreational fishing population. Similarly, many of the more commonly harvested species (A + B1) in 1990 are used for bait including the three listed under the most commonly caught species. The average weight of the harvested baitfish species, as indicated, tends to be low relative to non-bait species (e.g., the average weight of scaled sardines equaled 0.0266 lb). The total estimated catch by Gulf of Mexico anglers in 1990 equaled 106 million fish (Figure 10.64, left panel). Of this total, 22.5 million, or about 20 %, represented species that would normally be used for bait. Similarly, the number of fish harvested (A + B1) in 1990 was estimated to equal 44 million (Figure 10.65, left panel). Of this total, 13.3 million, or almost 30 %, represented species primarily used for bait. As also indicated by the information in Table 10.11, some of the species caught (A + B1 + B2) in 1990 were generally harvested (i.e., either retained or released dead) while for other species the catch and harvest figures can vary substantially. For example, an estimated 7.9 million scaled sardines were caught by recreational anglers in 1990, of which 7.4 million were harvested. By comparison, while an estimated 11.8 million spotted seatrout were caught by recreational anglers in 1990, about two-thirds of this total were released alive based on an"

231,178,0.531,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.5 Fisheries The North Sea ecosystem is overï¬shed (Cury et al. 2000; FAO 2012). Bottom and beam trawling are a major threat for marine organisms because they damage the seabed and alter mature benthic communities. Based on long-term data, Fock et al. (2014) stated that the age, volume and size composition of commercial ï¬sh stocks has shifted since 1902. As a result, species composition has shown signiï¬cant changes in recent decades. For example, slow-reproducing ï¬sh such as sharks and rays declined and may only be encountered in areas with low ï¬shing density. With beam trawling, the benthic community structure has changed from long-lived species (e.g. sharks and rays) to short-lived opportunistic and scavenging species (e.g. crabs and shrimps). Seagrasses declined along the Dutch, German and Danish coasts as a result of bottom trawling ï¬sheries and an epidemic of wasting disease in the 1930s. Exploitation of North Sea ï¬sh stocks has increased since 1945 as shown by trends in ï¬shery mortality among all groups of exploited ï¬sh species (Daan et al. 1990). As a result of measures to allow ï¬sh stocks to recover, total catches have declined since the late 1960s (Fig. 1.37). Even though pollution and overï¬shing in the North Sea (CabeÃ§adas et al. 1999) have resulted in major changes in species composition and shifts in species distribution, species richness based on International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data has increased over the past 30 years (ICES 2008); see"
231,951,0.53,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Weather variables such as air and sea temperature, and amounts of precipitation are changing. Intra- and interannual variability in these weather variables, temporal autocorrelation and the frequency of extreme events can also change over time, which may all affect population dynamics of coastal birds (Van de Pol et al. 2010a, b, 2011). However, climate may not change at the same rate throughout the year or in different parts of the world, and this can lead to phenological mismatches in food webs (Visser 2008) and require readjustment of migration schedules (Bauer et al. 2008). Global warming is causing both air and water temperatures to rise. Air temperatures directly affect the energetic expenditure and thereby food requirements of birds, particularly in small species during winter (Kersten and Piersma 1987). Many benthic and ï¬sh species that are prey items of coastal birds are strongly dependent on sea temperatures for growth, reproduction and survival (see also Chap. 8, Sect. 8.4). Severe winters can cause high mortality among many invertebrates, but these same cold winters can also cause shellï¬sh to lose less body mass (Honkoop and Beukema 1997) and result in a good spatfall (Beukema 1992). Thus, it has been suggested that global warming is already"

Greenberg and Marra (2005), and further, Jahn et al. (2004) provide a system-wide approach to new world migration that is particularly applicable to the Gulf. Migrants have three choices for flying between North America and Central/South America: (1) a circum-Gulf route through eastern Mexico and Texas, (2) a trans-Gulf route to the YucataÌn Peninsula and the Mexican coast, and (3) a circum-Gulf route through Florida and West Indies (Stevenson 1957; Langin et al. 2009). Since migration takes place over a relatively small time scale, but a large spatial scale, different factors affect migration patterns. On a small spatial scale, habitat (amount and quality, prey availability) is critical, while on a broader scale, weather and winds become critical (Moore 2000a). Wind patterns are generally favorable for birds to migrate across the Gulf in the spring, usually determined by studies with radar (Gauthreaux 1971, 1999; Gauthreaux et al. 2006). Migration patterns are not static, but shift from year to year and season to season, depending upon prevailing winds (Barrow et al. 2005). Analyzing data from 10 radar stations from Key West, Florida to Brownsville, Texas, Gauthreaux et al. (2006) showed that in the spring: (1) northbound migrants approached the northern Gulf Coast at between 1,000 and 2,500 m above ground; (2) the longitudes of peak arrivals were similar over the 4-year period (near longitude 75 west, northern Texas/western Louisiana); (3) wind trajectories over the Gulf of Mexico had relatively little influence on the longitude of peak arrival; (4) the longitude where the greatest density of trans-Gulf migrants arrived on the northern coast was relatively constant from year to year; and (5) on occasion, strong winds or storms displaced migrants, but migrants seemed to have a preferred route they followed. These conclusions suggest that conservation efforts should concentrate on the preferred routes and landing locations. These findings are intriguing and suggest the potential to develop conservation priorities for suitable habitat for northbound Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, especially when coupled with data from birds fitted with geolocators. Neotropical migrants face several decisions with respect to the Gulf of Mexico, including which route to follow, when to migrate, where to make landfall before crossing the Gulf, where to make landfall after crossing the Gulf, and how long to stop at stopovers on either side of the Gulf. Passage across the Gulf is long, and birds often arrive in the Louisiana northern Gulf Coast with little fat (Yong and Moore 1997), making coastal lands critical for increasing fat stores and continued survival. Peak numbers of spring Passerine migrants occur from mid-April to early May, and radar studies indicate that nearly all the Passerine migrants arrive from directly over the Gulf of Mexico (Gauthreaux 1971). A bad storm or hurricane can kill 40,000 migrants on one day, if it occurs during a peak time when migrants are arriving from their northward flight across the Gulf (Wiedenfeld and Wiedenfeld 1995). The coastal habitats used by migratory Passerines are extremely important because estimates suggest that most Nearctic-Neotropical migrant Passerines are unable to reach northern breeding sites in a single flight without stopping (e.g., thrushes) (Yong and Moore 1997). Passerines that are lean upon arrival often remain longer before departing for breeding grounds farther north (Moore and Kerlinger 1987). Length of stay in Louisiana after a transGulf flight is related to fat-depletion upon arrival; lean birds (Parulinae warblers) remained longer than fat ones, but if weather is favorable, birds continue to migrate (Moore and Kerlinger 1987). For migrant Passerines using the northern Gulf Coast, suitable stopover habitat is a critical feature. Migrant densities were most strongly related to forest cover within a 5 km radius; this feature influenced where migrants made landfall (Buler et al. 2007). Indeed along the coast of Mississippi, northbound songbirds made landfall in resource-rich habitats within 18 km (11 mile) of the coastline (Buler and Moore 2011)."
34,1293,0.529,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","14.1 INTRODUCTION How could the environmental health of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf or GoM) be described in regard to fish kills, diseases, and parasitic infections before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? This might seem like a simple question, but the answer is complex and difficult to report. Nevertheless, reporting some of that complexity is the aim of this chapter. Many people consider the GoM to be restricted to the offshore waters, but studies on diseases in offshore water deeper than 200 meters [m] (656 feet [ft]) are few, not very detailed, incomplete, and not necessarily representative of the entire Gulf. Looking at offshore fishes in the Gulf, one should also consider the nursery grounds for those species. These grounds are usually the estuaries of the Gulf. Moreover, these estuaries are independent habitats that provide important aspects of understanding mortality and diseases of animals throughout the entire Gulf. This chapter treats the entire GoM. Several factors have been impediments to research on this topic. An important reason for not being able to fully understand disease and its importance to the GoM involves the fact that when fishes become ill or otherwise stressed, they usually get preyed upon by predators and microbial consumers. Moreover, many diseases primarily affect the larval stages of the hosts, and individuals of these stages are so small that they are usually overlooked and seldom critically examined. When someone sees infected individuals, disease conditions may not necessarily be apparent. Infections in larval fishes by one or few individuals of a parasite species can have a role in disease epidemics. Observations of such cases can be supported by experimental laboratory studies. One critical reason that diseases in the Gulf of Mexico prior to the oil spill are not well-known is because some cutting-edge molecular diagnostic tools have been developed only recently and have not been widely applied for diagnosis of marine animal diseases. Another reason why diseases of offshore fishes as well as shellfishes, other invertebrates, marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds have not been studied relates to the high expense of collecting and studying the material. For example, charges for daily rental of large research ships can be as much as $50,000; the 29.7 m (97.4 ft) USM-GCRL R/V Tommy Munro, on which research involving the continental shelf is conducted, presently costs $7,200 plus the cost of fuel. Some of our past research has avoided high collecting costs because we took advantage of various inshore and offshore studies of fishes conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) by partaking in its cruises, by accompanying other biologists on their trips, by obtaining parasites from some fishes collected by others, by conducting numerous inshore and offshore collection activities from our own small vessels, by assessing diseases, and most importantly, by utilizing the vast array of literature reflecting research conducted by others."
34,624,0.528,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Florida generally accounted for between 75 and 85 % of the Gulf recreational catch (A + B1 + B2) expressed in numbers of fish during 1995â2009 (right panel). The annual recreational harvest (A + B1) of snappers from Florida waters expressed in pounds and as a percentage of the Gulf harvest is presented in Figure 10.109. As indicated, harvested pounds have been highly variable on an annual basis with a range from less than 2.5 million pounds to more than 5.5 million pounds. Since 1995, pounds of snappers harvested from Florida waters have averaged 3.8 million annually which represented almost 60 % of the total Gulf recreational snapper harvest (excluding Texas). Furthermore, as indicated, Floridaâs share of the Gulfâs total closely mimics the absolute Florida harvest in pounds. There are a large number of snapper species caught in Florida, with red snapper contributing the largest share of the total harvested poundage (A + B1). There has been a significant increase in the harvest of this species since 1995 (Figure 10.110, left panel) and this increase is generally attributed to growth in the stock and expansion of the stock from the northern Gulf to the Florida panhandle and down through the eastern Gulf."

Tagging studies suggest that juvenile red drum have limited dispersal but that adults can travel considerable distances in the Gulf of Mexico (Osburn et al. 1982; Overstreet 1983). Metapopulation structure may exist for the red drum in the Gulf of Mexico, and despite the likely complex spatial structure of the stock, red drum in the Gulf of Mexico is considered as a single stock, which implicitly assumes no spatial heterogeneity in the Gulf of Mexico red drum population. The impacts of this unrealistic assumption on the stock assessment and management of red drum are unknown."

They have a distinctive dark and white pattern of bands on the head, neck, and upper breast (Figure 12.36). The black and white breaks up the outline of birds, allowing them to disappear when motionless. They were listed in 1985, and recovery plans for several regions have been developed (USFWS 1999). They are endemic to North America, with a total population of about 8,000 (Gratto-Trevor and Abbott 2011). The Piping Plover has been given the highest conservation priority by the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, including for the Gulf Coast where they only winter (GCPWG 2000). They breed on the Atlantic coast of Canada and the U.S. Great Lakes region, Great Plains, the Canadian Prairies, and St. Pierre and Miquelon (French territories off the southwest coast of Newfoundland) (USFWS 1999; Elliott-Smith et al. 2004). They do not breed in the Gulf of Mexico. They winter along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts (into Mexico), and in the Caribbean (Elliott-Smith et al. 2004; Gratto-Trevor and Abbott 2011). Piping Plovers in Texas show wintering site fidelity (Drake et al. 2001). Piping Plovers forage on beaches, washover areas, and tidal flats on small invertebrates (Withers 2002). They frequently nest on sandy beaches with little vegetation, but with some shell or pebble cover; often near dunes (Wilcox 1959; Burger 1987b; Maslo et al. 2011). They are monogamous for one breeding season, although there are rare reports of sequential polyandry (Amirault et al. 2004). Both members of the pair incubate their four-egg clutch for 26â31 days (USFWS 1999), and both parents brood the young (Gratto-Trevor et al. 2010). The parents draw predators from their nests and chicks with very elaborate distraction displays, which involve a broken wing act (Figure 12.36). They are dependent on management, such as restrictive access for off-road vehicles (Burger 1991b, 1994b; USFWS 1999; Maslo and Lockwood 2009). There is controversy about the effectiveness of nest protection techniques. Nest protection includes nest enclosures (predator exclosures), electrified wires on enclosures, fencing (mainly for people), wardening, predator control, and captive breeding (Burger 1987b; Murphy et al. 2003; White and McMaster 2005; Cohen et al. 2008, 2009; Maslo and Lockwood 2009). Beach nourishment increases habitat for Piping Plover (Webster 2006). Management has largely focused on reducing mortality during the breeding cycle, and it is unclear whether the sustained efforts required can be maintained (Gratto-Trevor and Abbott 2011)."

Sex is determined by incubation temperatures prevailing during the middle third of the incubation period for all sea turtle species (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980; Wibbels 2007). Each species has a pivotal temperature, which is the temperature at which the sex ratio is one to one. Nest temperatures higher than the pivotal temperature produce mostly females, and lower temperatures produce mostly males (Witherington et al. 2006a). Immediately after emerging from the nest, sea turtle hatchlings begin a period of frenzied activity. During this period, they move from their nest to the surf, swim, and are swept through the surf zone (Witherington 1995; Conant et al. 2009). The hatchlings use a progression of orientation cues as they crawl to the water, swim through the surf, and migrate offshore (Lohmann and Lohmann 2003; Lohmann et al. 2012). Once they reach the oceanic zone, hatchlings spend a number of years growing and developing. Some sea turtle species return to the neritic zone as juveniles (e.g., Kempâs ridleys, loggerheads, greens, hawksbills), while others stay in the oceanic zone (e.g., leatherbacks) (Figure 11.1). Adults of some species remain in the neritic zone their entire lives (e.g., Kempâs ridleys), and some move back and forth between the neritic and oceanic zones (e.g., loggerheads). Some sea turtles spend their entire lives in the oceanic zone (e.g., leatherbacks), with the exception of females nesting in the terrestrial zone. While differences exist between and within species, adult females typically return to nest in the general vicinity of the beach where they hatched from eggs many years earlier and often nest at the same beach throughout their reproductive years. For example, while most loggerheads return to nest at the same beach from which they were hatched, individual loggerhead sea turtles have been known to nest on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of Florida (LeBuff 1974). Green turtles typically nest on the same beach where they hatched (Bowen et al. 1989; Allard et al. 1994)."

230,16,0.525,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract This chapter traces the history of marine litter research from anecdotal reports of entanglement and plastic ingestion in the 1960s to the current focus on microplastics and their role in the transfer of persistent organic pollutants to marine food webs. The reports in Science of large numbers of plastic pellets in the North Atlantic in the early 1970s stimulated research interest in plastic litter at sea, with papers reporting plastics on the seafloor and impacting a variety of marine animals. The focus then shifted to high concentrations of plastic litter in the North Pacific, where novel studies reported the dynamics of stranded beach litter, the factors influencing plastic ingestion by seabirds, and trends in fur seal entanglement. By the early 1980s, growing concern about the potential impacts of marine litter resulted in a series of meetings on marine debris. The first two international conferences held in Honolulu by the US National Marine Fisheries Service played a key role in setting the research agenda for the next decade. By the end of the 1980s, most impacts of marine litter were reasonably well understood, and attention shifted to seeking effective solutions to tackle the marine litter problem. Research was largely restricted to monitoring trends in litter to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures, until the last decade, when concern about microplastics coupled with the discovery of alarming densities of small plastic particles in the North Pacific âgarbage patchâ (and other mid-ocean gyres) stimulated the current wave of research.

Clearly, large uncertainties are associated with the current assessment of the red drum stock status described above. A bottom longline survey program has been developed to collect data for monitoring the red drum stock dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico (Powers et al. 2012). The condition of red drum within the Gulf of Mexico may also vary greatly from location to location. For example, the red drum population along the Florida Gulf coast appears to be recovered (Figure 9.52). Regardless of the uncertainties, the evolution of this fishery clearly demonstrates the necessity and importance of appropriate management regulations in improving the status of fish populations."

Later, Shane compared her Aransas Pass work with the results of a new study in the 1980s off Sanibel Island, Florida, almost precisely east of her former study area in Texas (Shane 2004). The Wells studies have continued and expanded and spawned several 100 publications resulting in one of the best-known cetacean populations in the world. A summary of the major findings from this set of studies is included in the section devoted to bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf. The first systematic offshore efforts to describe marine mammals in parts of the northern Gulf of Mexico occurred during the Fritts Surveys, 1979â1981 aerial surveys led by T. H. Fritts (Fritts et al. 1983). These surveys established that several dolphins of the genus Stenella occur off continental shelf and slope waters, but these early surveys (originally designed for sea turtle and sea bird assessments) suffered from small cetacean sample size, precluding abundance estimates, and some unfortunate misidentifications. For example, they did not distinguish between the two species of spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata and Stenella frontalis), now known to have quite different distribution patterns in the Gulf; at times the surveys confused spinner and Clymene dolphins (Stenella longirostris and Stenella clymene, respectively), and sometimes they misidentified either Clymene or pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) as short-beaked common dolphins. Common dolphins do not presently occur in the Gulf, nor are there verified historical records. The NMFS conducted a series of aerial surveys in continental and coastal waters (continental shelf aerial surveys, 1983â1986; red drum aerial surveys, 1986â1987) and established some estimates of numbers of the predominantly sighted cetacean, the common bottlenose dolphin. Since 1989, aerial and shipboard surveys have been conducted (albeit not in every year) in both coastal and deeper oceanic U.S. waters, commencing with Keith Mullinâs 1989â1990 continental slope aerial surveys that for the first time properly documented distribution and abundance of oceanic cetaceans in waters off Louisiana and Mississippi (Mullin et al. 1994; Jefferson and Schiro 1997) (Figure 13.2). In the 1990s, NMFS and Texas A&M University coordinated dedicated aerial and boat surveys in concert with descriptions of physical and"

From 1998 to 2006, on average, 6,240 metric tons (13.8 million lb) of dolphinfish were landed in the recreational fishery, which consisted of 94 % of the total dolphinfish landings; commercial fishermen landed 415 metric tons (914,909 lb) (NMFS 2009c). The total landings of dolphinfish increased from 2,100 metric tons (4.6 million lb) in 1981 to a peak of 11,300 metric tons (24.9 million lb) in 1997. Dolphinfish landings decreased to 5,800 metric tons (12.8 million lb) in 2006 (NMFS 2009c). Multiple councils manage dolphinfish (Table 9.38). A time series of relative abundance index data was developed based on U.S. longline fishery data, which was then used for the assessment of dolphinfish using a surplus production model (Prager 2000). The estimated MSY was about 12,000 metric tons (26.5 million lb)/year, and the estimated fishing mortality that yielded MSY (FMSY) was about 0.5 per year. The estimated stock biomass in 1998 was above BMSY, suggesting that the stock was not overfished in 1998. This assessment suggested some increase in stock size relative to previous estimates and that the fishery was sustainable (Prager 2000). Although a large uncertainty may exist in the assessment as a result of the quality and quantity of data and uncertainty about the stock structure, a recent assessment suggested that there was no decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) indices and that the current fishing mortality level appears to be sustainable (Collette et al. 2012).

230,28,0.52,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"1.4 Shifting Focus to the North Pacific Ocean Indications that the North Pacific was a hot spot for plastic litter date back to Kenyon and Kridlerâs (1969) paper on plastic ingestion by Laysan albatross. Subsequently, Bond (1971) found plastic pellets in all 20 red phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) examined when many individuals of this species came ashore along the coasts of southern California and Mexico in 1969. The birds apparently starved due to a shortage of surface plankton, and some were observed feeding along the strand line where plastic pellets were abundant (Bond 1971). It was unclear whether this had contributed to the high incidence of plastic in these birds, but Connors and Smith (1982) found plastic in six of seven red phalaropes killed by colliding with powerlines on their northward migration in central California. Birds with large volumes of ingested plastic had smaller fat reserves, raising concerns that ingested plastic reduced digestive efficiency or meal size. Baltz and Morejohn (1976) reported plastic in nine species of seabirds stranded in Monterey Bay, central California, during 1974â1975. All individuals of two species contained plastic: northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris). Industrial pellets predominated in these birds, but they were also found to contain pieces of food wrap, foamed polystyrene, synthetic sponge and pieces of rigid plastic. Baltz and Morejohn (1976) speculated that having large volumes of plastic in their stomachs could interfere with the birdsâ digestion, although they considered that toxic chemicals adsorbed to the plastics posed the greatest threat to bird health. Ohlendorf et al. (1978) showed that plastic ingestion also occurred among Alaskan seabirds. In the same year that Colton et al. (1974) showed the ubiquitous nature of plastic particles floating in the northwest Atlantic, Wong et al. (1974) reported that plastic pellets were widespread in the North Pacific Ocean. Sampling in 1972, they found that pellets occurred at lower densities (average 300 g kmâ2) than tar balls, but they outnumbered tar balls northeast of Hawaii, with up to 34,000 pellets kmâ2 (3500 g kmâ2). Even before this, however, Venrick et al. (1973) had shown that large litter items, at least half of which were made of plastic, were commonly encountered in the North Pacific gyre northeast of Hawaii (roughly 4.2 items kmâ2) in the area of the now notorious âNorth Pacific Garbage Patchâ. This is where Moore et al. (2001) recorded densities of more than"

Given the susceptibility of many of the species to overfishing in conjunction with their popularity by the commercial and recreational sectors, the GMFMC is considerably involved in the management of reef fish species. Management of reef fish species with respect to the commercial sector has historically included sector quotas, size and trip limits, closed seasons, limited entry, and, more recently, the introduction of catch shares (previously called individual fishing quotas). The introduction of catch shares, as discussed in more detail below, constitutes a major shift in management regime and one that is likely to become more prevalent over time. Following the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan (GMFMC 1981) and related amendments, Gulf of Mexico reef fish can be broadly classified into six groups: snappers, groupers, tilefish, jacks, amberjacks, and triggerfish.

The composition of the fish species accounting for over 50 % in each freeze were striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), and bay anchovy. They noted that the size classes of a species affected varied between some of the freezes, but not all species, e.g., pinfish. This observation they felt led to an âinstantaneous pictureâ of the species population structure at the time of the kill. Hence, the recommendation to fisheries managers was to respond to mass mortalities by imposing regulations to reduce fishing efforts immediately following the event to allow recruitment and compensatory mechanisms to take place. Commercial fishing after the cold kills, at least the 1940 episode, showed a dramatic decline (Gunter 1941). While there was some difference in the decline among commercial catches from the regions of Galveston, Matagorda, Aransas, and Laguna Madre, the red drum, spotted seatrout, and black drum all declined by 78 % while that of the southern flounder declined by 95 %. However, dead flounder do not float and because of their shape they are not easily trawled or dredged, so some mortalities could have easily escaped notice. He also tabulated data for catches after the 1940 freeze from both the year of the freeze and of the prior year and noted that there was no difference in decline from catches in the Gulf of Mexico. But there was in the bays, where the water was much shallower. It took about 3 years for the commercial catch to recover. Texas fishermen seem to agree that fish will be scarce for a few months after severe cold spells; whereas those from Florida and Mississippi estimate a 2- to 3-week period. As suggested above, this difference can be explained primarily by many of the fish in Florida, Mississippi, and offshore Texas migrating to more tolerable water or recovering after a water temperature rise after being affected but not killed. The nice thing about cold kills is that residents as well as numerous animals such as piscivorous birds and raccoons make a healthy feast of the freshly dead or numbed fish! Such is not the case for fish killed by most other causes."

34,651,0.515,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Aggregate Reef Fish: As noted when examining trips by area, Louisiana is primarily an inshore fishery. As such, it is not surprising that catch of offshore species is limited. The aggregate catch of reef fish in numbers of fish (A + B1 + B2) generally tends to be less than one million fish per year and harvest in pounds (A + B1) is generally less than two million pounds per year (Figure 10.125). Among the primary species harvested are red snapper (average annual landings of 558,000 since 1995) and greater amberjack (average landings of 231,000 lb annually since 1995). Other Offshore Species: Other than reef fish species, two offshore species highly desired by Louisiana anglers are yellowfin tuna and blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus). These two species are highly migratory in nature and, as such, yearly landings can fluctuate widely. Reported harvest of yellowfin tuna averaged 365,000 lb annually during 1995â2009, and blackfin tuna landings averaged 300,000 lb. Large expenditures are incurred in the harvest of these species due to the far offshore distance one must travel to catch either yellowfin or blackfin tuna and, as such, the number of trips is limited. The limited number and nature of these trips suggests caution should be exercised when assessing the reliability of these figures."
34,681,0.511,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Corpus Christi, Texas (True 1887; Doughty 1984). The Fulton cannery was the largest and operated between 1881 and 1896; in 1890, this cannery alone processed 900 green turtles (41.7 % of the turtle catch in the state) totaling 110,223 kg (243,000 lb) and produced about 40,000 0.9-kg (2-lb) cans (Doughty 1984). The green turtle cannery located in Rockport was founded around 1886. During its first 6 months of operation, the cannery processed about 3,856 kg (8,500 lb) of green turtle meat (True 1887). Green turtles caught and processed in Texas were presumed to feed in the seagrass beds located between Matagorda Bay and Laguna Madre (Hildebrand 1982). Rapid depletion of green turtle populations in Texas and elsewhere occurred because the fishery targeted juvenile turtles, a highly vulnerable stage in the life cycle of this slow-growing, late-maturing species (Crouse et al. 1987; Witzell 1994). While the green turtle fishery in Texas developed very quickly, it declined abruptly after 1892 and ended shortly thereafter, presumably due to the scarcity of turtles and to a deep freeze along the Texas coast (Hildebrand 1982). A small turtle fishery in Louisiana remained open through the early 1970s (Figure 11.2). Prior to 1860, green turtles caught on the Florida east coast, particularly in the Indian River Lagoon, were exchanged for goods with various merchant vessels; in later years, agents purchased the catch and then shipped it mainly to New York (True 1887). By 1887, green, loggerhead, and hawksbill turtles were hunted as far north as Beaufort and Morehead City, North Carolina, where green turtles in particular were a delicacy and consumed locally (True 1887). There was no mention of Kempâs ridley sea turtles being harvested in the early records, even though this species surely was present in Florida at the time (Carr 1957). The omission appears to have occurred because Kempâs ridleys were sold as loggerheads for years (Rebel 1974; Cato et al. 1978). Two locations on Floridaâs west coastâKey West and Homosassaâappear to have supported the most abundant in-water populations of green turtles in the entire Gulf of Mexico in the late 1800s. Captured turtles weighing between 18 and 45 kg (40 and 100 lb) were kept alive in small Kraals (Dutch for corral) or seawater-filled holding pens until ready to be shipped to New York (True 1887). Estimates indicate that about 50 18-kg (40-pound) turtles per week were brought to Key West throughout the year (True 1887). The green turtle fishery in the Cedar Keys area presumably arose around 1878. Fishing was concentrated in an area 32â48 kilometers (km) (20â30 miles [mi]) north and south from the main Cedar Keys port, with the shallow foraging grounds being the most productive (True 1887). Large boats brought between 1,361 and 2,268 kg (3,000 and 5,000 lb) of green turtles to port; whereas, small boats brought in only 23â363 kg (50â800 lb). Interestingly, the largest green turtle recorded at the time weighed an impressive 544 kg (1,200 lb) (True 1887). The reported weight of this turtle was questioned by Carr and Caldwell (1956), who indicated that green turtles landed in the Cedar Keys fisheries in the 1950s were no larger than 52 kg (115 lb). Alternatively, it is possible that the discrepancy reflects the impact of the decades-long turtle fishery in the region, leaving no large adult turtles in the population. Overall, statistics show that the Florida west coast produced about 81,647 kg (180,000 lb), Louisiana about 13,608 kg (30,000 lb), and Texas approximately 24,494 kg (54,000 lb) of green turtle meat in 1880, though apparently an unspecified amount of freshwater turtle meat was also included in these records (True 1887; Rebel 1974). No mention is made of significant sea turtle fisheries for any other Gulf coast state prior to 1880 besides Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. By 1887, the most important sea turtle fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico were those of the Cedar Keys area and around Key West (True 1887; Townsend 1899). Figure 11.3 shows statistics of turtle landings on the Florida Gulf coast between 1880 and 1897 for the years for which data are available (Townsend 1899), and provides a perspective of turtle demand in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico."

230,695,0.507,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"campaigns are conducted in many countries, and can be a source of marine litter information supported by citizen scientists (e.g. Ribic 1998; Martin 2013). For this review, marine litter studies were identified by searching the ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar databases for papers using the keywords âcitizen scienceâ or âvolunteerâ with âmarine litterâ, âmarine debrisâ or âplastic debrisâ. We thoroughly scanned the literature, identifying all studies in which volunteers had participated in sampling and/or sample processing. We only selected studies with a main focus on marine litter; studies which coincidentally also report interactions of litter with marine biota were not considered, unless these explicitly focused on litter aspects, such as plastic ingestion and entanglement by seabirds and marine mammals (Moore et al. 2009; van Franeker et al. 2011). At the time of writing, 40 marine litter studies were identified, which were based entirely or partly on data or samples contributed by citizen scientists (Appendix 1)."

In North America, they breed primarily along the Atlantic Coast from Maine south to all regions along the Gulf coast, to the east coast of Mexico, and down to South America, including the Caribbean Islands. On the west coast they breed in California, and on the west coast of Mexico and Central America. They also breed in scattered inland areas in the Central United States (McCrimmon et al. 2011). They winter throughout their breeding range, except for interior North America and the northeast coast (McCrimmon et al. 2011). Egrets are useful indicators for the Gulf Coast because they are colonial, conspicuous (large and white), usually nest higher in vegetation when it will support their nests, and are key members of wading bird nesting assemblages in the coastal regions all along the Gulf of Mexico, including Mexico (Burger 1978a; Mock 1978, 1980). They feed on intermediate-size fish, as well as reptiles, amphibians (especially frogs), small mammals, birds, crustaceans, mollusks, and insects (Stevenson and Anderson 1994). They also visit inland rice fields, crawfish ponds, and wet fields to find frogs, as well as dry fields to stalk small reptiles (Eubanks et al. 2006). Great Egrets nest in mixed-species colonies with other egrets, herons, ibises, and often Brown Pelicans. These colonies are stable as long as conditions remain viable and the habitat suitable; otherwise they switch sites (Kelly 2006a). They are monogamous, and both parents incubate and care for the young, including provisioning (McCrimmon et al. 2011). Incubation (28â29 days) begins with the first or second egg so that young hatch asynchronously; when food is in short supply, competition between siblings results in older chicks kicking eggs or younger chicks out of the nest (Mock and Lamey 1991; Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Great Egret populations, along with other herons and egrets, declined dramatically in much of the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s due to hunting their plumes for the millinery trade (Ogden 1978). Their plumes (called aegrettes), used in courtship displays, have a delicate, lacey appearance (Figure 12.16). The North American population of Great Egret"

Results from a recent survey of breeding Snowy Plovers in North America, conducted in 2007 and 2008, indicated that 42 % of all breeding Plovers resided in Great Salt Lake in Utah and Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma (Thomas et al. 2012). The total population for the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was 4,515 (19 % of total). Approximately 9 % of the North American breeding population occurs in Mexico (Thomas et al. 2012). Snowy Plover are attracted to extensive beaches with tidal pools and sand flats that provide foraging areas, although they will also feed in marshes (Withers 2002). They eat small mollusks, crustaceans, marine worms, and insects.

230,149,0.5,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"prey fishes (Bravo Rebolledo et al. 2013). A similar route for plastic ingestion was proposed by Di Beneditto and Ramos (2014), who showed that plastic in franciscana dolphins was related to benthic feeding habits, in which disturbance of sediment probably induced accidental intake of plastic debris. Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) may take up plastic accidentally during foraging on plants (Beck and Barros 1991). Pelagic loggerhead sea turtles may ingest plastic because they feed indiscriminately or graze on organisms settled on floating plastic (McCauley and Bjorndal 1999; Tomas et al. 2002). A special case of such accidental ingestion is known for the Laysan albatross who take up plastic particles in combination with eggs strings of flying fish. The fishes attach their eggs to floating items: previously seaweed, bits of wood or pumice, but nowadays often plastic objects (Pettit et al. 1981). This phenomenon has also been observed in loggerhead turtles. The plastic in their stomachs was sometimes covered by the eggs of the insect Halobates micans (Frick et al. 2009). A final case of unintentional plastic ingestion is that of secondary ingestion, which occurs when animals feed on prey, which had already ingested debris. This may concern both prey swallowed as a whole or scavenging. In seabirds, skuas are known to forage on smaller seabirds that consume plastic (Ryan 1987). Great skuas (Stercorarius skua) from the South Atlantic Ocean predate several seabird species, and their regurgitated boluses showed a link with the amount of secondarily ingested plastic and their main prey species (Bourne and Imber 1982; Ryan and Fraser 1988). In the monitoring study on northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) in the North Sea intact stomachs from scavenged fulmars or black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were occasionally found, which contained plastic (Van Franeker et al. 2011). A spectacular example of secondary ingestions was provided by Perry et al. (2013) who reported a ball of nylon fishing line in the stomach of a little auk (Alle alle), that was found in the stomach of a goose fish (Lophius americanus). The presence of small plastic particles in the faeces of fur seals on Macquarie Island was attributed to secondary ingestion through the consumption of myctophid fishes (Eriksson and Burton 2003). High abundance of small plastics in myctophid fishes (Boerger et al. 2010; Davison and Asch 2011), in combination with the fact that this type of fish is a common prey for many larger marine predators, suggest that secondary ingestion may be more common than reported."

Combined, these factors result in large spatiotemporal variability in physicochemical conditions, causing primary production to vary markedly within and across areas of different oceanographic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico (Grimes and Finucane 1991; Biggs 1992). Physicalâchemical variability affects the distribution, growth, and mortality of pelagic larvae of many fish species in the Gulf of Mexico (Govoni et al. 1989; DeVries et al. 1990; Lang et al. 1994). Higher abundance, increased growth, and reduced mortality have been observed for larvae within frontal features created by riverine discharge and hydrodynamic convergence (Lang et al. 1994; Hoffmayer et al. 2007). The great spatiotemporal variability in oceanographic and physicochemical conditions provides a large diversity of habitat for fish species that often require different habitats in their different stages of life history. The general movement patterns and key habitat requirements for fish of different lifehistory stages are responsible for the formulation of fish community structure (OâConnell et al. 2004). Environmental variables, such as temperature, primary production, current, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, water clarity, substrate, and geographic area, have been found important in regulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish communities (McEachran and Fechhelm 2005). Because of the large spatiotemporal variability in these environmental variables, fish community structure varies temporally among seasons and years and spatially over estuarine categories and geographic areas, such as in areas east and west of the Mississippi River (Hoese and Moore 1998; McEachran and Fechhelm 2005). For a given fish population, the dynamics of distribution, abundance, and life-history processes are greatly influenced by abiotic factors, such as water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and substrate, as well as a variety of biotic factors, such as food availability, intra- and interspecific competition, and predator abundance (Briggs 1974; Richards et al. 1989; Ahrenholz 1991). The most profound impacts of these factors on the dynamics of a fish population usually occur during their early life-history stages, when their survival rates are most sensitive to the change in biotic and abiotic environments (Gallaway et al. 2009). For marine fish species that tend to have planktonic early life-history stages (eggs and larvae), their survival rates during the planktonic life stage are usually a function of parental abundance and fecundity and their complex interactions with predation, oceanographic processes, and prey abundance (Richards and Lindeman 1987). Parental abundance can be greatly affected by the level of fishing mortality. The process of fish growing from early life-history stages to catchable sizes, or becoming catchable in commercial and recreational fisheries, is often referred to as recruitment, which consists of largely distinct ecological processes including survival of a cohort of planktonic eggs and larvae, spatiotemporal patterns of demersal settlement of free-swimming juveniles, and natural and fishing mortality of adults and juveniles before they reach the catchable sizes defined by fishing gear selectivity or minimum legal size requirements (Gallaway et al. 2009). Spatiotemporal variations in recruitment, which can be affected by environmental variables and commercial and recreational fisheries, contribute to variability in fish populations and community structure in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem (OâConnell et al. 2004; McEachran and Fechhelm 2005)."
230,574,0.499,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"of marine ecosystem services, which are estimated at â¬16.5 trillion in one study (Costanza et al. 1997), suggest that even fractional deterioration in provision would represent a significant cost (Beaumont et al. 2007; Galparsoro et al. 2014). Thus far, studies undertaken to estimate the economic impacts of marine litter have generally focused on the direct losses borne by economic activities adversely affected by the presence of marine litter in the environment, within which they operate and rely upon (see Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; MacFayden 2009; McIlgorm et al. 2011). Largely, such studies have not taken into account the often intangible costs of any social and ecological impacts. Some early studies allude to the need for research to explore these costs. For instance, Kirkley and McConnell (1997, p. 185) call for strategies, which account for the economics related to lost ecological functions driven by marine litter. The intricacy of developing such strategies can be illustrated with the example of alien invasive species. Marine litter provides additional opportunities for marine organisms to travel (including alien invasive species) up to threefold (Barnes 2002). Given that the introduction of alien invasive species can have a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems and biodiversity (Kiessling et al. 2015) and can result in serious economic losses to many marine industries, any estimates, which exclude such ecological impacts, will inevitably fall seriously short of the true cost of the marine litter problem. For example, the introduction of the carpet sea squirt (Didemnum vexillum) in Holyhead Harbour (Wales, U.K.) resulted in an eradication and monitoring program over a decade starting in 2009, which was expected to cost â¬670,000. This expenditure was economically justified as allowing the species to spread unpredated and smother organisms and marine habitats would have cost the local mussel fisheries up to â¬8.6 million alone over 10 years (Holt 2009). Goldstein et al. (2014) recorded the ciliate pathogen Halofolliculina (known to cause skeletal eroding band disease in corals) on floating plastic debris in the western Pacific and suggested that the spread of the disease to Caribbean and Hawaiian corals may be due to rafting on the enormous quantities of litter reported from the area. Increased coral mortality or the introduction of other pathogens via floating marine debris may lead to economic costs, for example through decreased revenues due to falling numbers of visiting tourists. Despite their partial coverage, the studies that are available provide sufficient information to draw a number of important conclusions. The main economic sectors, which have been identified from the literature as being affected by marine litter are agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, commercial shipping and recreational boating, coastal municipalities, coastal tourism sector and the emergency rescue services (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010). The economic impacts affecting these sectors are described and quantified where possible (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; McIlgorm et al. 2011; Jang et al., 2014; Antonelis 2011). They also make attempts at aggregating economic impacts across sectors to provide regional cost estimates. Mouat et al. (2010) provide an estimate of marine litter costs for the Shetland (U.K.) economy, of â¬1â1.1 million on average per year, an estimate, which consists of actual expenditures and, in some cases, estimated lost income. This is only a single case study, and the sectors affected on Shetland would be affected to"
34,204,0.499,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","However, tagged fish showed highly variable movement patterns, regardless of tagging location, season, or egress status. Seasonal changes in distribution suggested a northâsouth cyclical movement pattern within the Gulf of Mexico that supported a new perspective on Atlantic blue marlin, in which the Gulf of Mexico provides suitable year-round habitat that is utilized by a subset of the Atlantic population. An analysis of otolith chemistry of Atlantic blue marlin also suggested that movement out of the Gulf of Mexico for Atlantic blue marlin may be more limited, as compared to other regions (Wells et al. 2010). Atlantic blue marlin in the Gulf of Mexico tend to remain in offshore waters (Table 9.19). However, they may move close to the coast from July to September. They spawn in the Gulf of Mexico as early as May and continue to spawn throughout the summer (Table 9.18). Atlantic blue marlin that spawn on spawning grounds off Texas and Louisiana during the summer remain in the Gulf through the fall and winter. Blue marlin tag/recapture data from the Gulf of Mexico indicate that seasonal movements may occur between the Gulf of Mexico (summer) and the Bahamas (winter). Several data sources indicate that the Gulf of Mexico may serve as important spawning and/or nursery habitat for blue marlin (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008; Rooker et al. 2012). Blue marlin larvae were found in a 2005 fishery-independent survey in the areas from 27 to 28 N to 90 to 94 W in July (Rooker et al. 2012). This seems to suggest that blue marlin can spawn in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008; Kraus et al. 2011). However, larvae mainly are present near the western margin of Loop Current on the continental shelf in relatively warm waters (>27  C). The presence of young blue marlin larvae along the boundary of the Loop Current may be a result of transport from Caribbean/Straits of Florida spawning events (Kraus et al. 2011; Rooker et al. 2012). Because no spawning-capable adults have been captured in this region, it is unlikely that blue marlin spawn in the Loop Current in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008). Strong histological evidence supports the lack of spawning in the northern Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River, which is augmented by the failure to capture blue marlin larvae in areas not associated with the Loop Current (Kraus and Rooker 2007; Kraus et al. 2011; Rooker et al. 2012). Thus, the likelihood of blue marlin spawning in the northern Gulf of Mexico is slim, although the northern Gulf of Mexico supports an active recreational fishery for blue marlin from May through September (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008). Limited published information is available on blue marlin biology and life history from the Gulf of Mexico (Table 9.18) (De Sylva et al. 2000). Females are batch spawners and can spawn as many as four times in a spawning season (Brown-Peterson et al. 2004). They often release more than seven million eggs at once, each approximately 1 mm (0.04 in.) in diameter (BrownPeterson et al. 2008). The larvae may grow as much as 16 mm (0.63 in.) in a day (BrownPeterson et al. 2008). Males may live for 18 years and females up to 27 years. Females can grow up to four times the weight of males (Wilson et al. 1991; ICCAT 1997). The M estimated using the Hoenig method (Hoenig 1983) at a maximum age of 30 years is 0.14 (Hill et al. 1989), which was used in the most recent stock assessment. The estimated blue marlin recruitment fluctuates over time and has been low in recent years (Figure 9.28). However, there is great uncertainty associated with the estimated recruitment, which results mainly from uncertainty in the quality of fishery and biological data, as well as the assumed stock structure and population dynamics. Given the large distributional area that the Atlantic blue marlin occupies and the existence of multiple spawning grounds, blue marlin in different areas may be subject to different environmental stressors and prey availability. This may result in large spatial variability in key life-history parameters, such as growth and maturation."

That worm is typically found in the mullet during winter months and absent by May or June. We do not know the snail intermediate host, but it is probably a hydrobiid that was rare in our Mississippi estuaries pre-Katrina. Parasites in migratory fish are another matter. Adults of the bucephalid Prosorhynchoides ovatus in the Atlantic tripletail (Lobotes surinamensis) occurred abundantly inshore and offshore both before and after the storm as did other bucephalids from other offshore migratory fishes such as scombrids. The bucephalid lifecycle involves a bivalve to a fish to the final fish host. Fauna of the sandy barrier islands off Mississippi include a variety of crustaceans, clams, snails, polychaetes, acorn worms, brittle stars, and other invertebrates. Even though those beaches were lost or reshaped, most of the nearshore beach fauna was reestablished, according to Richard Heard of USM, within 6â12 months. Some of the species on the Gulf side took longer, up to 2 years, especially those species without planktonic larvae such as pericaridean crustaceans (like amphipods and isopods). Reestablishment of these animals was easier to determine than that of those from the muddy benthos, but what is important to remember in regard to parasites is that once the invertebrate has reestablished, worms from an infected final host have to deposit eggs and the resulting larvae have to infect those invertebrate hosts. As indicated above, this infection of a parasite may take several years, and the final monitoring results provide information on the presence of all the hosts for a particular parasite in the ecosystem and the overall environmental health of that ecosystem. Parasites are also good indicators of toxicants in the ecosystem. The myxosporidian Henneguya gambusi probably infects Gambusia affinis, the western mosquitofish, in extremely low intensity and is difficult to detect. However, when in a stream along coastal Mississippi that was contaminated with the heavy metals chromium, copper, and arsenate, the mosquitofish exhibited heavy infections that involved the intestine, gonads, kidney, and even brain tissue (Overstreet and Monson 2002). Infections presumably kill the mosquitofish in nature since when we transferred samples of fish from this location into the laboratory and maintained them in aquaria, a little more than half the fish died within 6 months when compared with none dying nor expressing an infection in samples collected from non-contaminated locations. No infected fish survived 12 months, but non-infected ones had a high survival. After the hurricane, infections were absent; however, they occurred again in August 2007. The surge apparently flushed out the contaminated water and the infected oligochaete intermediate hosts. The mosquitofish from this location before the hurricane contained no adult tapeworm infection. After the storm, the invasive Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi) showed up in the mosquitofish (Figure 14.44); this adult cestode had previously been collected from mosquitofish in locations numerous kilometers from that contaminated location. Parasites have been shown to be good indicators of pollution, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PCBs, but usually as non-point sources. Some studies treat the Gulf (e.g., Overstreet and Howse 1977; Skinner 1982; Overstreet 1988; Landsberg et al. 1998; VidalMartÄ±Ìnez et al. 2014), but most studies treat other areas (e.g., Khan and Thulin 1991; MacKenzie et al. 1995; Austin 1999; Broeg et al. 1999; Dzikowski et al. 2003). Most of the studies have shown that the parasites of fish are more sensitive biomarkers to environmental stressors than the fish by themselves. Landsberg et al. (1998) related specific natural and chemical stressors to specific parasites in the silver perch in Florida. Skinner (1982) showed that the gills of the yellow fin mojarra (Gerres cinereus), grey snapper, and timucu (Strongylura timucu) from a polluted but not a non-polluted area in Biscayne Bay, Florida, expressed excessive mucus production, epithelial hyperplasia, fused lamellae, and telangiectasia. Three species of monogenoids on the gills of fish from the polluted area occurred in significantly greater mean intensity, presumably because of gill pathology and altered host resistance to the parasites.

Adult mullet can be found in waters ranging from 0 to 75 ppt salinity, but juveniles cannot tolerate such wide salinity ranges. The habitat preferences of juvenile and adult striped mullet include shallow estuarine and marine waters, as well as contiguous freshwaters (Table 9.40).

231,756,0.497,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"This chapter presents a review of what is known about the impacts of climate change on the biota (plankton, benthos, ï¬sh, seabirds and marine mammals) of the North Sea. Examples show how the changing North Sea environment is affecting biological processes and organisation at all scales, including the physiology, reproduction, growth, survival, behaviour and transport of individuals; the distribution, dynamics and evolution of populations; and the trophic structure and coupling of ecosystems. These complex responses can be detected because there are detailed long-term biological and environmental records for the North Sea; written records go back 500 years and archaeological records many thousands of years. The information presented here shows that the composition and productivity of the North Sea marine ecosystem is clearly affected by climate change and that this will have consequences for sustainable levels of harvesting and other ecosystem services in the future. Multi-variate ocean climate indicators that can be used to monitor and warn of changes in composition and productivity are now being developed for the North Sea."

However, some habitat types or land cover types are unusable (such as developed lands). This appendix provides maps of habitat type (land cover) using the National Land Cover database from the National Geospatial Management Center, developed by Jason Wells, ENVIRON International Corporation, Houston, Texas in consultation with the author. Land Cover was determined for 10 mile (16.1 km) and 25 mile (40.2 km) from the coastline. Methodology is described below as well as the land cover types used (USDA, National Geospatial Management Center; accessed 28 March, 2012).

GIS Procedures: For analytical purposes, the data resources were preprocessed or normalized to a consistent datum and projection. Since we were attempting to gain aerial estimates of land cover classes by state, our choice was to use the North American Datum 1983 (based on the Geodetic Reference System GRS 1980 spheroid) and NAD 1983 Albers projection using meters as the unit of measure. For mapping display purposes, the geographic coordinate systemâWGS 1984 was used with projection âon-the-flyâ from ArcGIS 10. We chose operational GIS layers for this analysis as the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD 2006) and a polyline feature class from ESRI Data and Maps 2010 called Detailed County Lines. The NLCD was used to derive comparative areal estimates of land cover classification by coastal state within 10 and 25 miles of coastal shoreline and the coastal shoreline was derived from the Detailed County Lines feature class.

As indicated, total offshore effort approached or exceeded 200,000 days fished per year throughout the 1990s. Since 2003, however, effort has fallen sharply and in recent years, has been less than 70,000 days per year. Overall, effort in recent years has only been about one-third to one-half of the observed effort throughout the 1990s. Analysis by Nance et al. (2006) examines the relationship between catch and effort in the offshore component of the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery and if their analysis is valid, one can conclude that the current level of effort associated with the offshore component of the fishery is significantly less than what is required to harvest maximum yield. This conclusion, however, needs to be tempered because the treated relationship between offshore yield and effort in their analysis was considered independently of inshore shrimping activities. As the case with respect to offshore effort, inshore effort has also fallen sharply in recent years. Reduction in effort in the inshore component of the fishery would, one might hypothesize, result in increased escapement of the small shrimp to offshore waters and, hence, an increasing abundance of shrimp in the offshore waters. This increased abundance translates into a higher catch per unit of effort in the offshore waters. A more detailed examination of effort in the two main northern Gulf of Mexico shrimp fisheriesâthe brown shrimp fishery and the white shrimp fisheryâcan be made with the aid of Figure 10.20. As indicated, total estimated effort (i.e., inshore and offshore) in the brown shrimp fishery (Grids 7â21)7 fell from almost 200,000 days annually in the early 1990s to about 160,000 days by the late 1990s/early 2000s (effort is assumed to be directed at a particular species if at least 90 % of that tripâs catch comprises that particular species). Thereafter, in association with the sharp decline in shrimp price and increasing fuel costs, effort fell precipitously to less than 50,000 days in recent years. A somewhat different picture emerges when one examines total effort (i.e., inshore and offshore) white shrimp effort (Figure 10.20, right panel). As indicated, effort associated with this fishery showed a large increase in the mid-1990s to early 2000s with an abnormally high number of days fished being reported in 2002 (169,000 days). Thereafter, however, effort fell sharply to about 60,000 days in recent years. This decline in effort coincided with a period of increasing white shrimp harvest indicating a significant increase in the catch per unit effort."

The D variant was found only in the loggerhead. Green turtle (Chelonia mydas) fibropapillomatosis with or without mortality has been associated with herpesvirus, retrovirus, natural tumor-promoter okadaic acid, arginine, external parasites, trematode egg interaction, and environmental factors demonstrating that these combinations of conditions can be pathogenic and life-threatening (Aguirre et al. 1998; Herbst 1994; Casey et al. 1997; Landsberg et al. 1999; Dailey and Morris 1995; Alfaro-NuÌnÌez et al. 2014; Foley et al. 2005; Ene et al. 2005; Work et al. 2004; Van Houtan et al. 2010). There does not seem to be any single factor inducing infections or causing mortality. Work et al. (2001) concluded that turtles with severe FP were immunosuppressed, but immunosuppression was not a prerequisite for development of FP and neither were trace metals nor organic contaminants (Aguirre et al. 1994). Induction of FP by herpesviruses seems to be promoted by a metabolic influx of the amino acid arginine; lysine inhibits the virus and proline aids the viral infection. Moreover, eutrophication spurs nuisance algal blooms where arginine would be elevated, consequently promoting the FP tumors in C. mydas. Okadaic acid also promotes tumors and is produced by toxic benthic dinoflagellates in the genus Prorocentrum, which are fed on heavily by C. mydas exhibiting FP in Hawaii (Landsberg et al. 1999). There appears to be an interesting relationship of FP with blood flukes (in the Gulf, at least two different described species of Spirorchiidae infect C. mydas, and three infect C. caretta (e.g., Overstreet et al. 2009)). Adult flukes and their eggs were initially assumed to be related to FP in relatively large specimens of C. mydas, but later considered not to be the immediate cause of the disease. In the mid 1960s, R. Overstreet removed tumors from many caged 20 cm (8 in) and larger specimens of C. mydas maintained by R.E. Schroeder in Marathon, Florida Keys, Florida, and saw some spirorchiid eggs in larger turtles, but all the tumors contained considerable cyanobacteria, diatoms, and other algae appearing to cause some cellular response. After one or more viruses had been implicated in the etiology of FP, Aguirre et al. (1998) studied the relationship between blood fluke infections and fibropapillomatosis in C. mydas in Hawaii. A generalized thickening and hardening of major vessels (aortic, pulmonary, mesenteric, and hepatic) and thrombosis with complete or partial occlusion occurred in turtles containing both FP and spirorchiidiasis and were considered primary causes of mortality. Similar pathogenesis has been reported from both wild and cultured sea turtles worldwide (e.g., Aguirre et al. 1998). Chen et al. (2012) provided several references on fluke infections in C. mydas associated with mortality, but they considered the mortality in the stranded juvenile turtles, apparently without FP, in Taiwan probably from fishery by-catch rather than the fluke-associated pathogenic alterations. When a large number of young C. mydas exhibiting a robust nutritional condition became moribund or died from a single hypothermic event in Florida, Stacy et al. (2010) took advantage of them to assess the pathological responses to spirorchiid infections. They determined that the responses differed relative to trematode species, species of turtle (C. mydas and C. caretta), and size of turtle host. Even though some turtles exhibited severe pathological alterations, only one specimen of C. mydas died from a worm infection even though infections probably contributed to poor health in others. In a report of Australian strandings in which size of turtles was not given, blood flukes caused death in 10 of 96 and contributed to death in 29 more of the 96 (Gordon et al. 1998). In those, many were chronically ill, whereas in Florida, examined turtles died from a variety of acute insults. An apparent undescribed quite pathogenic species of Neospirorchis sp. was most common as adult worms and associated egg masses in large C. mydas and C. caretta and infected the leptomenenges, thymic gland, and thyroid gland rather than heart and major arteries like Neospirorchis pricei and the other blood flukes. In general, adults of most species produce proliferative endarteritis, with parasitic granulomas and thrombosis inhibiting blood flow; eggs typically become trapped in capillaries,"

Modeling approaches are useful for interpreting experimental and observation data, as well as for risk assessment of the hazards caused by plastic ingestion in wildlife (Koelmans 2015). Because this is discussed in detail by Koelmans (2015), the discussion here will be limited to observational data in the field and experimental data in the laboratory. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that chemical contaminants do transfer from plastic debris to marine animals. Correlative evidence in the field and laboratory shows that the concentrations of PCBs (Ryan et al. 1988; Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011) and trace metals (Lavers et al. 2014) in seabirds are positively correlated with the mass of ingested plastic. Moreover, seabirds collected from the North Pacific were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the ingested plastic in their gut content (Tanaka et al. 2013) and myctophid fish collected from the South Atlantic were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the plastic debris in the region (Rochman et al. 2014b). These observational data suggest that plastic-associated chemicals from plastic do transfer to wildlife upon ingestion. This hypothesis has been further investigated in controlled laboratory studies, providing a stronger weight of evidence. Two studies demonstrated the bioaccumulation of additive PBDEs in crickets (Acheta domesticus; Gaylor et al. 2012) and amphipods (Allorchestes compressa; Chua et al. 2014) as a result of the ingestion of plastic. Another study showed greater concentrations of PCBs in lugworms exposed to contaminated sediment with polystyrene as opposed to contaminated sediment without plastic, suggesting that the existence of the plastic in the experiment facilitated the transfer of chemicals to lugworms (Arenicola marina; Besseling et al. 2013). Another laboratory study demonstrated that both additive chemicals and chemicals that accumulate in nature (nonylphenol, phenanthrene, PBDE-47 and triclosan) desorb from PVC and can transfer into the tissues of lugworms upon ingestion (A. marina; Browne et al. 2013). Lastly, a study measuring the bioaccumulation of POPs sorbed to plastics demonstrated the transfer of chrysene, PCB 28 and several congeners of PBDEs to fish from the ingestion of polyethylene pellets (Rochman et al. 2013b). Thus, there is strong evidence showing that chemical contaminants can bioaccumulate in marine life when plastic debris is ingested. What remains less understood, is whether these plastic-associated contaminants biomagnify in higher trophic level animals as a direct result of plastic ingestion (potentially leading to bioaccumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in seafood; Fig. 5.3) and how important bioaccumulation from plastic is relative to bioaccumulation from other sources of chemical contamination in the environment (e.g. chemical contamination that is ubiquitous in water, sediments and food webs globally; Ross and Birnbaum 2010). Still, the fact that chemicals from plastic debris can transfer to marine animals begs the question, how do these chemicals associated with plastic debris impact marine organisms?"
230,392,0.494,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract Microplastics are an emerging marine pollutant. It is important to understand their distribution in the marine environment and their implications on marine habitats and marine biota. Microplastics have been found in almost every marine habitat around the world, with plastic composition and environmental conditions significantly affecting their distribution. Marine biota interact with microplastics including birds, fish, turtles, mammals and invertebrates. The biological repercussions depend on to the size of microplastics encountered, with smaller sizes having greater effects on organisms at the cellular level. In the micrometre range plastics are readily ingested and egested, whereas nanometre-sized plastics can pass through cell membranes. Despite concerns raised by ingestion, the effects of microplastic ingestion in natural populations and the implications for food webs are not understood. Without knowledge of retention and egestion rates of field populations, it is difficult to deduce ecological consequences. There is evidence to suggest that microplastics enter food chains and there is trophic transfer between predators and prey. What is clear is that further research on a variety of marine organisms is required to understand the environmental implications of microplastics in more detail and to establish effects in natural populations.

34,426,0.492,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","10.3.4 Dockside Value of Landings Gulf fisheries brought in $658 million (i.e., dockside value), on average, for the last 3 years of the 1990â2009 study period. The first 3-year average for the period was $568 million for an 18 % increase in nominal terms. The high single year was 2000 with value at $997 million (Figure 10.8). The last year of the period had value at its lowest over the 20 years. Value increased while landings decreased 10 %. Key species values were mixed: (1) oyster value increased 89 % under increased supplies of 61 %, (2) blue crab landings were 14 % lower with a value increase response of 59 %, (3) menhaden landed value was 15 % higher on 9 % lower landings, (4) white shrimp value was up 24 % on much higher landings of 41 %, and (5) brown shrimp was 37 % lower on a drop of 27 % in landings. Recall that these are for 3-year averages at the start and end of the 1990â2009 period. NOAA Fisheries maintains an ex-vessel price series with 1982 as the base year (i.e., 1982 Â¼ 100). The ex-vessel price indexes for blue crab, oysters, menhaden, and Gulf and South Atlantic shrimp are good descriptors for the Gulf. However, none of the edible finfish from the Gulf have price indexes. The substitute index used herein is that of total edible finfish in the country. Edible finfish ex-vessel prices in 1990 had an index of 130 but ended at 117 in 2009. The interpretation is that overall finfish ex-vessel prices were 30 % higher in 1990 compared to 1982 but only 17 % higher by 2009. The index for blue crab was at 152 in 1990 with a large increase to 383 by 2009. Oyster harvesters were successful marketing in 1990 at prices that put the index at 228, the highest index for the key species. By 2009, the oyster index reflected more favorable conditions with an index of 273. Ex-vessel prices in the vertically integrated menhaden industry are estimated from a small number of firms. The index levels in 1990 and 2009 were 128 and 154, respectively. The situation for shrimp necessitated that all warm water shrimp be used in the calculation, not just the brown and white shrimp noted previously in this chapter. Brown and white shrimp commonly comprise over 95 % of landings. For 1990, the index was 79 signaling a 21 % decrease from the 1982 base. Although there were"
34,1006,0.491,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","As a federally endangered species, Piping Plovers are useful indicators because their populations are closely monitored, and their wintering in the Gulf Coast makes them vulnerable to coastal stressors. Populations declined during shorebird harvesting for the millinery trade in the late 1880s and early 1900s (USFWS 1999). In the latter half of the twentieth century, however, Piping Plover populations declined because of habitat loss and alterations, human disturbance, and increased nest predation (Sidle 1984). The breeding population estimate of 5,945 plovers is probably an underestimate (Elliott-Smith et al. 2009). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified human disturbance and habitat loss as the two greatest threats to Piping Plovers on the wintering ground (USFWS 2009b). Other threats during the fall and winter include hurricanes, oil spills, and red tides. Gratto-Trevor and Abbott (2011) provide the best and most comprehensive review of conservation efforts for Piping Plover. A complete winter survey of Piping Plovers was conducted in 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 (Haig and Plissner 1993; Haig et al. 2005; Elliott-Smith et al. 2009). In 2001, they reported 2,389 piping plover during the winter, but 5,945 adults were counted during the breeding season (Haig et al. 2005). In 2006, the International Piping Plover Census covered more than 12,400 km of potential habitat in 2 weeks (2,470 sites, 1,300 observers) (Elliott-Smith et al. 2009; GrattoTrevor and Abbott 2011). More Piping Plovers were recorded in 2006 in the northern Gulf than in either 1996 or 2001, but numbers were lower than in 1991. In all years, Texas had most of the Piping Plovers (Table 12.10)."

35,634,0.48,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Abstract Global demand for seafood is increasing. Supply from wild caught sources has been essentially flat for twenty years and, depending on the speciï¬c ï¬shery, in decline for many species that are considered fully exploited or over-exploited. As the fastest growing sector of world food production, aquaculture is increasingly playing a major role and currently accounts for nearly half of the total aquatic production worldwide. Marine cage culture in particular provides an opportunity to utilize vast amounts of the worldâs surface area to produce ï¬sh, shellï¬sh, and plants, while avoiding land-use conflicts in crowded coastal regions. Currently in the US, very small volumes of marine ï¬sh are produced and very large volumes are imported. This trend shows no signs of slowing down with an ever increasing annual seafood trade deï¬cit. In an effort to initiate more domestic production, private companies, research institutions, and government agencies have all been involved in various types of aquaculture production. Aquaculture can be generally categorized as land-based, near shore, or offshore. Offshore marine ï¬sh culture utilizing cages has been conducted on both the east and west coast of the US as well as in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Speciï¬cs on the projects in the GoM are described in the following sections."

Dolphinfish spawn in warm ocean currents (water temperatures greater than 24  C) throughout much of the year (Tables 9.36, 9.37, and 9.38), and spawning occurs in the open water when the water temperature rises. The spawning season varies greatly with latitude. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, spawning occurs at least from April through December, while spawning takes place throughout the year in the southern Gulf of Mexico, and oceanic waters are preferred (Tables 9.36 and 9.37). Larval and juvenile dolphinfish are commonly found in floating seaweed (Gibbs and Collette 1959; Beardsley 1967; Rose and Hassler 1974). In waters above 34  C, dolphinfish larvae are found year-round, with greater numbers detected in spring and fall. In a study conducted in the northern Gulf of Mexico, 70 % of the youngest larvae collected were found at a depth greater than 180 m (590 ft). Dolphinfish are among the fastest-growing fish, and they become sexually mature within a few months (Table 9.36). The length at maturity varies spatially, ranging from 35 to 53 cm (13.8â20.9 in.)

As indicated, the estimated annual number of fish being caught by recreational anglers, though highly variable on a year-to-year basis, increased during the period of analysis. From 1995 to 1999, the average catch expressed in number of fish equaled 27 million annually. By 2005â2009, this figure had increased to 36 million. Overall, Louisianaâs share of the total Gulf catch (excluding Texas) expressed in numbers of fish averaged 21 % during the 15-year period of analysis and ranged from a low of 15 % in 2002 to a high of 26 % in 2000. As was found to be the case throughout the Gulf, a large proportion of the catch by anglers in Louisianaâs waters is released with the annual estimate of 50â60 %. This high release rate reflects a combination of the catch of undesirable species (e.g., hardhead catfish) and regulations (particularly size limits and bag limits)."

241,920,0.475,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"16.3.2.1 Salinity In the Baltic Sea, changes in salinity can have a cascading effect on food webs through the whole pelagic ecosystem (HÃ¤nninen et al. 2003; Wasmund et al. 2011). Some climate change scenarios project a decrease in Baltic Sea salinity, while others project an increase (BACC Author Team 2008; Chap. 13). A fall in salinity would lead to a decrease in marine species and an increase in freshwater species (MÃ¶llmann et al. 2005; MacKenzie et al. 2007), while an increase in salinity would cause the reverse. Changes in salinity would probably affect coastal birds and seabirds indirectly, mainly through changes in food availability. For instance, distribution and size of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis are highly dependent on salinity (Westerbom et al. 2008), whereas the Baltic clam Macoma balthica has a greater capacity to acclimatise to highly dilute brackish conditions (Jansen et al. 2009). As it is mediated by food availability, the relationship between salinity and bird populations may not become apparent immediately (RÃ¶nkÃ¤ et al. 2005). 16.3.2.2 Water Temperature The marine ecosystem is sensitive to changes in water temperature, which can affect the plankton (Dahlgren et al. 2011; Wasmund et al. 2011) as well as ï¬sh reproduction and survival (Margonski et al. 2010), and may thus have an impact on the food resources of coastal birds and seabirds.

222,685,0.475,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"In order to explore the impact of particular fisheries, management scenarios model runs using the species-based model for Hilsa shad and Bombay duck were undertaken. For this exercise, averaged outputs of the three climate ensembles were calculated to enable a focus specifically on the relative impacts of fisheries management decisions. The results are presented relative to the year 2000 model outputs (not the actual catches), but the different management interventions are implemented at year 1980, as the model needs to settle and reflect the interventions before the period of analysis. For this reason, by 2000 the three management trajectories already diverge from the actual recorded catches. Results conclude that both Hilsa shad and Bombay duck catches will decline over time regardless of the fisheries management regime, but to different degrees (Fig. 25.4). For Hilsa the decline stabilises under MSY management at 175,000 t by 2035, while it virtually collapses around the same period under the OF scenario. A significant inter-annual variability is also observed (Fig. 25.4). By the 2050s the decline in catches is between 39 per cent (under MSY) and 87 per cent. For Bombay duck inter-annual variability is reduced (Fig. 25.4), and while catch potential declines continuously under all management scenarios, they do not lead to biological collapse. By the 2050s this decline is around 35 per cent for all management scenarios. Potential catches are on average higher in the more sustainable scenarios (MSY) than in the BAU scenario for both species (91 per cent in Hilsa Shad and 37 per cent in Bombay duck by the 2050s). It is useful to compare the outcomes of the BAU scenario in the 2000s decade with those of a more sustainable scenario in coming decades. The results indicate that a change to sustainable management would result in a very minor decline in potential catches by the 2020s but a still significant"

While walking, they swing their slightly open bill from side to side; when it contacts prey, it snaps shut, mainly on fish, crayfish, shrimp, insects, and other aquatic invertebrates (Lewis 1983; Dumas 2000). Decline of the species in a specific area of the Gulf could be caused by loss of foraging habitat, although Spoonbills can move to other areas with suitable shallow pools for foraging. Roseate Spoonbills nest in mixed-species colonies with other herons and egrets, although in some places they nest mainly with White Ibis (Imhof 1962). They prefer islands and keys without predator access. In a colony in Nueces Bay, Texas, they nested with Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, Cattle Egrets, Louisiana Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, and Laughing Gulls (White et al. 1982), which is typical in other parts of their range. They nest low in trees or shrubs, including mangroves (Sprunt 1954; Portnoy 1977; Lewis 1983). Incubation requires 22â24 days (Lewis 1983), and the nesting season can be prolonged because nesting is not synchronous within a colony (Sprunt 1954). Postbreeding movements require more study, although some birds from Texas move a little south into Mexico (Dumas 2000), and birds from Florida move northward (Hancock et al. 1992). Roseate Spoonbills, like many other wading birds, suffered virtual extirpation in the late 1800s to the mid-1930s because of harvesting for plumes and food. From 1865 to the late 1880s they were limited to small areas in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida (Imhof 1962). They were nearly extirpated by the late 1800s from the U.S. Gulf coast; their numbers declined to only 15 pairs during the end of the plume trade era (Rodgers et al. 1996). Spoonbill numbers gradually increased after protection from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. They first began breeding in Texas in 1923, and Friedmann (1925) saw flocks of 75â100 feeding in shallow water and reported another flock of 1,000 feeding in southern Texas. They increased to 830 pairs by 1941 to 3,000 pairs in the 1970s, and then declined to 1,124 pairs in the 1980s (Dumas 2000). By 1996, they were up to 2,901 pairs (Dumas 2000). In Louisiana, numbers ranged up to 150 pairs in the 1940s, and then increased thereafter (while they decreased in Texas), with a 36 % increase from 1966 to 1989 (Breeding Bird Survey) (Dumas 2000). Data from Florida Bay indicated a steady increase in the number of Roseate Spoonbill colonies, and nests, but great variability among years (Figure 12.22) (Powell et al. 1989). There were fewer than 500 pairs in the 2000s (Lorenz et al. 2008). Thus their numbers appear to have declined. A recent review by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FFWCC 2011a) recommended that Roseate Spoonbills be given the status of threatened because populations are very small and restricted. Nesting colonies are affected by hydrological changes caused by management. For example, construction of canals in the Everglades reduced the flow of freshwater to the Florida Bay and decreased Roseate Spoonbills in the 1980s (Davis et al. 2005). Small fish are the primary food of Roseate Spoonbills in Florida Bay (Bjork and Powell 1994), and without a water depth threshold of 12 cm, fish are not sufficiently concentrated to provide adequate food reserves (Lorenz 2000). Thus, hydrology (salinity gradients, water depth, and dry-down) influences whether birds nest and also their reproductive success (Davis et al. 2005). Delany and Scott (2006) estimated that the number of Roseate Spoonbills in Florida and the West Indies was 3,400 individuals. Data from Shamrock Island in Texas indicated a variable, but generally stable trend from 1973 to 1999 (Gorman and Smith 2001). The number of breeding pairs varied from about 25â200 (Figure 12.23). Thereafter, numbers seemed to increase (TCWS 2012). Using Christmas Bird Counts from 1965 to 2011, Niven and Butcher (2011) reported that wintering Roseate Spoonbills showed a significant increase of 5.9 % per year. Figure 12.24 shows populations from 1951 to 2001."
34,922,0.471,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","12.3 LAND-WATER INTERFACE Land-water interfaces usually have high species diversity and high biomass because they contain a range of different habitats. Habitats are intermixed in different patch sizes, and the interface serves as the gateway for movement into both aquatic and terrestrial environments. While it is impossible to clearly define the coastal zone, functionally it is the area on either side of the actual meeting of the land and ocean that is influenced by both marine and terrestrial inputs. The margins themselves are usually narrow, providing an opportunity for animals to move quickly from one habitat to another (Burger 1991a). Since these characteristics apply to both plant and invertebrate communities, the diversity is amplified in higher trophic levels, such as fish, birds, and mammals. The land-water interface also serves as a physical buffer for both the marine ecosystem and for the terrestrial system. Estuarine and coastal environments protect inland terrestrial habitats from excessively high tides, hurricanes, erosion, and other severe storm events, while protecting marine environments from contamination by providing a sink for contaminants. The margin constantly changes due to the effects of wind and water. Because it is large, the Gulf of Mexico has a long coastline with a wide range of habitats. Because of its geographical position, it has a diversity of habitats that extend from tropical to temperate and from coastal to offshore islands. The Gulf serves as a conduit or migration route to southern wintering grounds between the United States (and more northern Canada) and Mexico, Central America, and South America (Gallardo et al. 2004). The land mass to the north is larger and serves as a funnel point for birds scattered across North America that are migrating to wintering grounds along the Gulf of Mexico or farther south. Most of the birds of the Gulf of Mexico are tied to the coastal zone because of breeding constraints and foraging opportunities. Gallardo et al. (2009) lists 395 species in 53 families as the number of bird species in the Gulf region. The main families in the Gulf are ducks (Anatidae, 46 species), gulls, terns and skimmers (Laridae, N Â¼ 41), herons and egrets (Ardeidae, N Â¼ 17), rails (Rallidae, N Â¼ 16), warblers (Parulidae, N Â¼ 36), and flycatchers (Tyrannidae, N Â¼ 17). The latter two groups are Passerines, but they frequently occur on coastal islands, on marshes, and in coastal forest habitats either as migrants or during the breeding season (Moore et al. 1990; Buler et al. 2007; Buler and Moore 2011). For a full list of the species, see Gallardo et al. (2009). Coasts are impacted by weather and storm events, as well as anthropogenic factors, such as alteration of hydrological processes, introduction of toxic chemicals and nutrients, increased human population density, increased fishing and other commercial enterprises, development of wind energy, increased numbers of oil and gas platforms, and direct human disturbance. Half of the continental U.S. population resides within 50 mile of the coasts, making them the most rapidly growing areas in the United States. From the 1960s to 2015, the population density of all Gulf coastal counties is expected to increase from 187 to 327 people per square mile (NOAA 1998). Condominiums, resorts, casinos, and other commercial and industrial development already characterize large expanses of the northern Gulf Coast. Development of wind energy is ongoing, both nearshore and offshore, and has the potential"

73,903,0.469,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Intertidal coastal wetlands are dynamic systems that are habitat for mangrove and saltmarsh plant communities. They deliver a wide range of ecosystem services (Perillo et al. 2009) providing a range of value and non-value uses (see Barbier et al. 2010 for a detailed review) including nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important ï¬sh species (Sheaves et al. 2014), habitat for migratory birds (Visser and Baltz 2009) and aesthetic green spaces. Coastal wetlands improve water quality by stripping nutrients and intercepting sediments, and they reduce erosion by protecting the foreshore from waves and currents (Costanza et al. 2006). In addition, mangrove and saltmarsh are amongst the most efï¬cient ecosystems in the world at sequestering carbon (Saintilan et al. 2013) and are being investigated for future Blue Carbon opportunities (e.g., Mcleod et al. 2011; Irving et al. 2011). However loss of coastal wetlands is a major concern globally (Irving et al. 2011) with urbanisation and development identiï¬ed as the most common cause of mangrove loss (Dale et al. 2014). Losses in New South Wales (NSW) Australia have been estimated at 60 % for the period from European settlement (1788) to 1970 (Goodrick 1970) with losses continuing to occur (Pressey and Middleton 1982). More recently loss of saltmarsh (Saintilan et al. 2014) has resulted in its listing as an endangered ecological community within NSW and nationally. The high conservation value of coastal wetlands is now better recognised with many protected by legislation and sometimes via land use zonings. However, even when there is protection via zoning or other means, coastal wetlands often retain legacies of past land uses that pre-date the zoning. Clearing, draining and construction of roads associated with agricultural and urban development are major contributors to loss, fragmentation and degradation of coastal wetlands (Williams and Watford 1997).

As this species covers fairly the same niche as the European lobster and is also a high value seafood product on the market, it is another promising candidate that should be examined. Passive ï¬shery on brown crab is very common along Northern European coasts and also in several offshore areas of the German Bight and reduces the ecological pressure on the endangered lobster population. Clear positive effects on the potential of OWFs to function as refuge for ï¬sh and marine animals were observed for crustacean species such as brown crab (Cancer pagurus) due to increased opportunities for shelter and food availability (StelzenmÃ¼ller et al. 2016)."

230,610,0.466,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.5 Conclusions Marine litter is a complex problem to address, which exerts significant economic costs, often borne not by the polluter but by coastal and marine industries such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, etc. (some of which also contribute significantly to marine litter). Economic instruments have a potentially important role to play in addressing marine litter, with initiatives in place in several countries proving that they can lead to significant reductions in waste entering the environment (ten Brink et al. 2009). The development of effective and efficient instruments requires a strong link between the behavior change driven by the instrument and the harm caused by marine litter. However, there are several areas where there is a lack of sufficient information to make this link. At the heart of this is the problem of understanding the harm caused by marine litter. The harm caused by some forms of litter is known, however, there are large gaps in this understanding. While the presence of litter in the marine environment and even its ingestion, etc., in species is documented, it is not clear what impact it is having on critical populations of marine organisms or indeed species higher up the food chain (including humans). Further, while some specific types of litter are identified as having some impacts (discarded nets, plastic bags, etc.), the impacts of other types of litter are currently poorly understood, which is most notable with the debate on micro- and nanoplastics. In relation to socio-economic impacts, impacts on tourism from beach litter are documented, but a quantitative link between the impact and levels of litter is poorly understood (Ballance et al. 2000). These links between types, quantities and sources of marine litter and their varied impacts are important to understand if targeted economic instruments are to be developed. Otherwise an instrument may lead to a reduction in litter, but with a limited reduction in impact."

Juvenile blacktip shark abundance showed significant correlation with turbidity/water clarity (Bethea et al. 2009). They can also be tolerant of low salinity, moving into estuaries and mangrove swamps. Seasonal migration has been documented to avoid unfavorable thermal habitats, usually moving into warm waters during the fall and returning to inshore feeding/nursery grounds in the spring. Newborn and juvenile blacktip sharks can be found on muddy/sandy/seagrass grounds in inshore shallow nurseries in late spring and early summer, and grown females tend to return to the nurseries where they were born to give birth. Young blacktip sharks are most likely to form aggregations in early summer to avoid predators (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2005). There tends to be segregation by sex and age, with adult males and nonpregnant females being found apart from pregnant females; juveniles are separated from both groups in the winter (Castro 1996). The abundance of blacktip sharks in the Gulf of Mexico has had a relatively small decrease since the 1980s and seems to have stabilized or slightly increased since 2000 (Figure 9.81). The spawning stock fecundity that describes stock reproductive potential has the same trend as stock abundance. The most recent stock assessment concluded that the Gulf of Mexico blacktip shark stock was not overfished, and overfishing was not occurring (SEDAR 29 2012). This conclusion is robust with respect to all of the uncertainty in data quality and quantity and assumptions considered in the assessment (SEDAR 29 2012)."

Juvenile red drum prefer rivers, bays, canals, tidal creeks, passes in estuaries, seagrass beds, oyster bars, mud flats, and sand bottom (Table 9.28). As they mature, red drum move farther into the open Gulf of Mexico, and adults can be found along coastal beaches and nearshore shelf waters (Table 9.28). Essential fish habitat, which is shown in Figure 9.50 and described in Table 9.28, has been designated for the red drum."
34,1386,0.46,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Nematodes play an important role in the parasite community. Adults have separate males and females as opposed to being hermaphroditic like the flatworms discussed above. In some cases, the adults can cause mortality, but these usually involve situations where the habitat is confined. The Gulf contains numerous species of Contracaecum, and the adults occur in piscivorous birds. The American white pelican hosts five species (Overstreet and Curran 2005), and in some cases, juvenile specimens embedded in the proventriculus may cause disease and even mortality. But adults, typically embedded in encapsulated ulcers, can number over 1000 per bird and rather than harming the bird, they often leave the protective ulcer, embed in the prey fish, and help break down the fish tissue. Presumably, they are helpful rather than harmful. Pelicans, herons, egrets, and many other water birds serve as definitive hosts (Figure 14.46). Fish and crustaceans are the typical second intermediate host after a copepod or other crustacean first intermediate host. When in high enough numbers, the third stage infective juvenile can weaken or cause mortality, but infections seldom cause mass mortalities. If the juvenile infects larval or postlarval fish, it can kill the fish that probably have little effect on the fish population. The effect that juveniles embedded in the liver, kidney, spleen, or other organs may have on the reproductive ability of some fish hosts should be investigated. The nematode Eustrongylides ignotus obtains considerable attention because the red worm as long as a human finger can cause human peritonitis when people eat raw second intermediate fish hosts (Overstreet 2003, 2013). Small fish such as the western mosquitofish and small Gulf killifish obtain infections by feeding on the oligochaete first intermediate host. Larger fish that feed on infected mosquitofish and young killifish serve as paratenic hosts, in which the worm grows considerably but remains the same stage infective to the heron or egret bird final host. The striped bass, Morone saxatilis, is known to die from an association with the infection in harsh conditions (Mitchell et al. 2009)."
231,172,0.46,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"There are over 200 species of ï¬sh in the North Sea and their total annual productivity has been estimated at 1.8 g C mâ2 (Daan et al. 1990). Cushing (1984) reported a large increase in the abundance of gadoids such as whiting Merlangius merlangus, haddock Melanogrammus aegleï¬nus, cod Gadus morhua and Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii accompanied by a decrease in herring Clupea harengus in the 1960s, commonly referred to as the âgadoid outburstâ. Overall, demersal ï¬sh and their size composition have declined in the North Sea since the start of the 20th century (Pope and Macer 1996). The commercial ï¬shery was heavily exploited in the 1960s, when landings peaked and then declined following a ban on herring in 1977 from a change in EU ï¬sheries policy. The ï¬shery reopened in 1981 and landings increased until 1988 followed by a record low in the 1990s. Of the roughly 10 million t of ï¬sh and shellï¬sh biomass produced each year in the North Sea, around 25 % is removed by the ï¬shery, 50 % is consumed by predatory ï¬sh species, and the rest is consumed by birds and mammals or lost to disease (Daan et al. 1990). About 2.3 million t of ï¬sh and shellï¬sh were landed in the North Sea in 1999 (FAO 2003). Fish catches over the past 60 years seem strongly related to levels of primary production (Chassot et al. 2010). Pelagic species such as herring and mackerel are the most important in landings, as well as smaller species such as sardines, and anchovy. Demersal landings include cod, haddock, whiting, saithe Pollachius virens, plaice and sole. Detailed statistics of ï¬sh landings are available from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES 2008; FAO Annual reports; see also Chaps. 8 and 12). The sedimentary environment of the North Sea contains up to 5000 species of macrobenthic and meiobenthic invertebrates (Heip and Craeymeersch 1995). Total macrobenthic biomass decreases northward from 51.5Â°N while biodiversity and density increase (Heip et al. 1992). Rehm and Rachor (2007) also showed benthic biomass to decrease with distance from the coast. According to Heip and Craeymeersch (1995), northern species of the macrobenthic community extend southward to the northern slope of Dogger Bank and southern species extend northward to the 100 m depth contour. They also found the separation between northern and southern species to disappear at around the 70 m depth contour in the central North Sea."

To examine dead or dying stranding animals, one required a permit or special permission and such was seldom obtained before the animal decomposed too much to be evaluated. A few cases of single stranded animals appeared to result from an ectopic parasite. Trematodes and nematodes or their eggs have been found in the brains of these animals along the Pacific coast, and, in the Gulf during the 1980s, we observed in stranded bottlenose dolphins lung infections of metastrongyle nematodes Halocercus lagenorhynchi and Skrjabinalius cryptocephalus associated with pneumonia. Those findings compared favorably with those reported by Fauquier et al. (2009). Dailey et al.

Many more birds were counted in the tanks of salt pans (64.5%), than in either rice ï¬elds (27.2%) or intertidal areas (8.4%). This pattern was also found for most individual species, although there were also several species with peak counts (>75% of observations) in rice ï¬elds (e.g. cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, purple heron, white stork Ciconia ciconia, black stork C. nigra, glossy ibis Plegadis falcinellus, and lapwing Vanellus vanellus).

Oceanic Stenella dolphins also occur most often in cold-core cyclonic rather than anticyclonic zones. They do not generally occur on the upper slope or in the abyssal, greater than 3,000 m (9,843 ft) deep zone. The pantropical spotted dolphin is the most numerous of any cetacean in the Gulf of Mexico and presents a striking feature of large group sizeâoften more than 100 dolphins per groupâand general abundance. The more important use of cold-core rather than warm-core eddies/gyres can be found in numerous examples of data presented by Davis et al.

260,274,0.456,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ranaviruses were detected and diagnosed as a disease agent in amphibians in the 1960s, and in reptiles and fish in the 1980s (Duffus et al. 2015). Since these initial cases, ranaviruses have been linked to numerous epizootic mortality events in these three classes of lower vertebrate animals (Duffus et al. 2015). Although long-term population data are generally lacking, there is evidence that ranaviruses can cause population declines in amphibians (Teacher et al. 2010; Beebee 2012; Earl and Gray 2014; Price et al. 2014). Further, the nearly complete loss of entire age classes of fish and amphibians due to ranavirus outbreaks have been reported (Petranka et al. 2003; Todd-Thompson 2010; Waltzek et al. 2014; Wheelwright et al. 2014), and some species of global conservation concern are highly susceptible (Geng et al. 2010; Sutton et al. 2014a). More recently, the potential economic impact of ranaviruses in farmed fish and amphibians (Mazzoni et al. 2009; Waltzek et al. 2014), and on recreational fisheries (Grizzle and Brunner 2003) has been recognized.

In any event, we could bend over and cradle the gars, successfully lifting them out of the water. There are cases where crustaceans can transmit viruses and other pathogenic agents to their hosts. One such case discussed earlier (Section 14.4.1.2) suggests internal lymphocystis virus in the silver perch being transmitted from a skin infection through gill lesions produced by the cymothoid Livoneca ovalis. The taxonomy of the Livoneca redmanii-ovalis complex needs attention, but the Gulf species is common in the Gulf and infests a wide range of hosts. Figure 14.51 shows a lane snapper, Lutjanus synagris, from off Horn Island, Mississippi, with a typically exposed specimen. Usually a single specimen occurs on the gills, and the effect that individual has on the host or the population is difficult to establish. Blaylock and Overstreet (2002), however, provided photographs (Figures 12.38 and 12.39 from Blaylock and Overstreet (2002)) showing six individuals causing a flaring of the operculae and heavily eroded gill filaments of an anemic year-old juvenile spotted seatrout in Mississippi. Livoneca ovalis (most likely a separate species of the Livoneca redmanii-ovalis complex) was noted by both Pearson (1929) for seatrout from Texas and Overstreet (1983a) for seatrout from Mississippi to occur on runted fish during their first 2 years and was more than likely to cause a gradual mortality of those fish. The infested spotted seatrout in Mississippi ranged between 10 and 17 cm (4â7 in) in length from November through May and often hosted two specimens of the isopod. The same species also caused extensive erosion of the gills of juvenile red drum in Mississippi marshes (Overstreet 1983b). Cymothoids are also known to cause mass mortalities in cultured fish, but the majority of cases involve fishes infested by cymothoids that are not on their natural hosts (Smit et al. 2014). Careful field and laboratory studies in the Great Barrier Reef on the cymothoid Anilocra pomacentri attached laterally on the pomacentrid reef fish Chromis nitida demonstrated an association often thought to be relatively harmless because the isopod stays attached for a long period. However, observations on a single cohort of fish showed the significantly depressed growth, reproduction, and survivorship of the infested fish. A parasitized female fish produced only 12 % of the number of eggs produced by a non-parasitized counterpart of the same size. Mortality of juvenile fish was estimated to be 88 % relative to 66 % during the first 70 days after recruitment. Within 48 h of attachment, the isopod penetrates through the skin into the muscle (Adlard and Lester 1995). In laboratory trials, fish mortality from infestation ranged from 78 % for small fish compared with 28 % for larger fish within 4 days of experimental infestation (Adlard and Lester 1994). Most cymothoid life cycles have been based on speculation; two have been described with considerable detail: Glossobius hemiramphi from the ballyhoo, Hemiramphus brasiliensis, from South Florida (Bakenhaster et al. 2006) and A. pomacentri mentioned above from Australia (Adlard and Lester 1995). The final marsupial stage on the female known as a manca immediately swims to the appropriate final host and develops into a male. Then in turn, this protandric hermaphrodite develops into a female, which feeds heavily on host blood, apparently only during periods related to onset of vitellogenesis. The adult female occupies the buccal cavity of the ballyhoo or externally dorsal and posterior to one of the eyes of the chromis. Some other species probably differ because juvenile stages have been collected from hosts other than the recognized final host. Another of the several Gulf cymothoids that attracts attention of biologists is Olencira praegustator, a species that infests the tongue of the Gulf menhaden. Guthrie and Kroger (1974) point out that their data, which also covers infestations of the Atlantic menhaden along the Atlantic coast, suggest that injured or infested adult menhaden school with juvenile menhaden in estuarine nursery areas rather than with their own year-class of fish in offshore waters. When enough infested individuals were present, they formed schools independent of"

The eggs of Gulf menhaden are planktonic and drift with prevailing currents for almost 48 h before hatching. Early larvae also drift with the current and feed on phytoplankton. Currents transport Gulf menhaden larvae into low-salinity estuaries for early growth (Minello and Webb 1997). This transportation from spawning grounds to estuarine nursery grounds is critical for the survival of Gulf menhaden larvae. As they grow larger and become able to swim, they shift their diet to zooplankton. After developing gill rakers, they filter-feed on plankton, typically near the surface. In fresh and brackish estuaries and rivers, they grow rapidly in spring and summer, and by fall, they migrate to high-salinity offshore waters no deeper than 100 m (328 ft). No eastâwest component of annual migration was found for Gulf menhaden in tagging studies (Kroger and Pristas 1975; Pristas et al. 1976); however, Gulf menhaden from the eastern and western extremes of their ranges tend to move toward the center of their range with age (Ahrenholz 1991)."

Based on a large-scale econometric model of the world shrimp market U.S. market, the European Union [EU] market, and the Japanese market), Poudel (2008) analyzes the impacts of increased shrimp production in different regions of the world (Asia, Central America, and South America) on the Gulf of Mexico dockside price as well as the influence of changes in own landings (i.e., Gulf landings) on the dockside price. The analysis was based on quarterly data from 1990 to 2004. Overall, Poudel (2008) found the dockside price to be relatively invariant to large changes in landings with a 10 % increase (decrease) in Gulf landings resulting in a 1.7 % decline (increase) in dockside price, holding all other factors constant. The small response in price to a change in landings is not unexpected given that the U.S. shrimp supply is dominated by imports. Furthermore, given"

Thus, much of the understanding of trends in North Sea benthos is based on evidence from relatively few sites. However, because most benthic animals have planktonic life stages the recent advances in molecular analysis mean preserved plankton samples can be now be reanalysed (Kirby and Lindley 2005). North Sea plankton samples, collected monthly by CPR since 1948 from all parts of the North Sea, show increasing abundance of meroplankton (the planktonic life stages of benthic species) and a decline in the abundance of holoplankton (permanent planktonic species) since 1958 (Lindley and Batten 2002). In contrast to deeper water benthic species, rocky shore species are easier to survey due to their greater accessibility and because their community dynamics, biodiversity and ecology can be studied experimentally (Sagarin et al. 1999; Tomanek and Helmuth 2002). Benthic community structure in the North Sea is affected by hydrographic variables; bottom water temperature has a particularly strong influence, but also bottom water salinity, and tidal stress (for the infauna). Chapter 1 discusses the dynamics of water masses in the North Sea and effects on hydrographic properties which affect the composition and productivity of pelagic (planktonic) communities (see Sect. 8.2) which, in turn, affect the benthic communities. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) drives some of the observed changes in benthic-pelagic coupling and has been shown to affect benthic communities off north-eastern Germany (KrÃ¶ncke et al. 1998, 2001) and in the Skagerrak off western Sweden (Tunberg and Nelson 1998), by causing variability in nutrient supply, changes in planktonic biomass and so"

230,18,0.452,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"1.1 Introduction From messages in bottles to exotic tropical seeds washing up on temperate shores (Guppy 1917; Muir 1937), the dispersal of floating debris at sea has long fascinated people. As early as 1870 Jules Verne provided a graphic description of how floating debris accumulates in ocean gyres in the chapter on the Sargasso Sea in his famous novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea. However, this review focuses on the last 50 years because from the perspective of environmental impacts the history of marine litter research is closely linked to the development of plastics. Plastics are a diverse group of synthetic polymers that have their origins in the late 19th century, but which really came to the fore in the mid-twentieth century. Their low density, durability, excellent barrier properties and relatively low cost make plastics ideal materials for a wide range of manufacturing and packaging applications. Their versatility has seen the amount of plastic produced annually increase rapidly over the last few decades to an estimated 288 million tonnes in 2012 (Fig. 1.1), and this total continues to grow at about 4 % per year (PlasticsEurope 2013). However, the properties that make plastics so useful also make inappropriately handled waste plastics a significant environmental threat. Their durability means that they persist in the environment for many years, and their low density means that they are readily dispersed by water and wind, sometimes travelling thousands of kilometres from source areas (Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, plastic wastes are now ubiquitous pollutants in even the most remote areas of the world (Barnes et al. 2009). Over the last 60 years we have seen a major shift in perception surrounding the use of plastics, especially in one-off applications. Once seen as the savior of the American housewife (Life Magazine 1955), there are now calls to treat waste plastics as hazardous materials (Rochman et al. 2013a), reiterating a point first made by Bean (1987) that persistent plastic wastes qualify as hazardous wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Most of the threats posed by plastics occur at sea (Gregory 2009; Thompson et al. 2009), where waste plastics tend to accumulate (Barnes et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2009). This chapter briefly summarises the history of marine litter research. Trends in the numbers of"

The spawning stock biomass of the western Atlantic bluefin tuna has declined substantially over the past few decades and is at a very low level despite more than 20 years of strict regulations on the western Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery (NMFS 2012b). Large uncertainty is associated with the most recent Atlantic bluefin tuna stock assessment, in particular with the estimated recruitment. The status of the population and fishery are dependent on the assumptions made on recruitment dynamics. For the high productivity scenario, the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock is considered overfished (e.g., population level is too low) and the fishery is in the status of overfishing (e.g., fishing mortality is too high) (Table 9.17) (NMFS 2012a). However, for the low productivity scenario, the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock is not overfished and the fishery is not in the status of overfishing (NMFS 2012a). Because of the limited information available, it is not clear which scenario more realistically describes the dynamics of Atlantic bluefin tuna recruitment. Despite the uncertainty in the stock assessment, the stock biomass of the western Atlantic bluefin tuna has decreased greatly since the 1970s, mainly as a result of overfishing (NMFS 2012a). Overfishing over the last several decades has greatly reduced the spawning stock biomass and stock reproductive potential, likely resulting in poor recruitment and current low stock biomass of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. However, the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock appears to be stable or even slightly increasing over the last 10 years, perhaps resulting from conservation measures and regulations (NMFS 2012a)."

241,923,0.449,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(Cramp and Simmons 1977; Pihl et al. 1995; Gilissen et al. 2002). A minor component of the Finnish and Swedish populations of some coastal birds remains in the northern Baltic Sea (Gilissen et al. 2002). Winter severity in the Baltic Sea reflects winter severity in the North Sea and further off the coast of western Europe, as well as in central Europe (Hurrell 1995). Winter severity in western Europe affects the non-breeding survival of several coastal birds and seabirds (Nilsson 1984; Koskinen et al. 2003). In addition to mortality from starvation and cold, severe winters may force birds to migrate further than normal and this incurs extra energy costs. Furthermore, when the Baltic Sea is largely ice-covered, seabirds are forced to feed in small open areas which increases competition for food and possibly the risk of disease (Grenquist 1965; Hario et al. 1995). Climate change affects the arrival and departure times of migrants (Forchhammer et al. 2002; JonzÃ©n et al. 2002; HÃ¼ppop and HÃ¼ppop 2003; Lehikoinen et al. 2004; Lehikoinen and Sparks 2010; Lehikoinen and Jaatinen 2011) and the timing of breeding (Forchhammer et al. 1998; Both and Visser 2001; MÃ¸ller 2002; Sanz 2002). A mismatch between hatching time and resource availability has been observed in passerines (e.g. pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Both et al. 2006) as well as in ducks (Oja and PÃ¶ysÃ¤ 2007). Trophic mismatches may cause population declines particularly in long-distance migrants in seasonal habitats (Both et al. 2010). In addition to trophic constraints, longdistance migrants may suffer from increasing competitive pressure by residents and short-distance migrants along with climate change, contributing to population declines in longdistance migrants (Lemoine and BÃ¶hning-Gaese 2003). Climate change may also drive changes in migratory routes, stopover sites and migratory tendencies within species and populations. For instance, delayed departure from breeding areas may be the cause of recently observed northward shifts in wintering ducks (Lehikoinen and Jaatinen 2011). Milder winters may allow birds to winter closer to breeding grounds and thus contribute to higher survival, which has been proposed for the mallard (Gunnarsson et al. 2012). However, temperature may be less important in shaping the wintering distributions of European dabbling ducks than factors such as feeding ecology (Dalby et al. 2013). Species ranges are expected to move poleward with climate change (Thomas and Lennon 1999; Hickling et al. 2006), and this has already been shown for the breeding ranges of central European and Arctic birds (Brommer et al. 2012). More study species (41; 69 %) shifted their range margin northwards than southwards (18; 31 %) (Î§2, p = 0.00275). Only a few range margin shifts were greater than three grid squares. An example of a species with a large shift in the southern border northward is the ruff Philomachus pugnax. Large shifts in the northern border occurred in coot, mute swan, common eider, razorbill and Arctic skua"

These two prey items accounted for 84 % of the total diet. Unidentified Pisces (6.9 %) and Betaeus granulimanus (Decapoda) were the next most common prey items. Age â¥2+ Pacific cod consumed a wider range of organisms compared with younger fish. In Sendai Bay, the older cod most commonly preyed on sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), followed by Paroctopus spp. (P. dofleini and P. conispadiceus), Pleuronectes spp. (P. herzensteini and P. yokohamae), and Crangon spp. A number of other fish and invertebrates were observed in the stomachs of age 2+ Pacific cod captured from April to June in Sendai Bay. Age 1+ Pacific cod fed on the small pelagic invertebrates Euphausia pacifica, Watasenia scintillans, and Themisto japonica in April and June on the upper continental slope off Tohoku (Fig. 10.7). Age â¥2+ Pacific cod preyed primarily on flathead flounder Hippoglossoids dubius, followed by Euphausia pacifica. In October and November, benthic shrimp Pandalus eous were the most abundant (wet-weight) prey item of 1-year-old Pacific cod, followed by myctophid fish Diaphus watasei and unidentified fishes (Fig. 10.7). Older cod frequently fed on unidentifiable fishes, as well as Diaphus watasei and horsehair crab Erimacrus isenbeckii. These observations suggest that Pacific cod shift food items not only ontogenetically but also spatiotemporally. Age 1+ cod fed on benthic Natantia euphausiids, small decapod cephalopods, small fishes, and cephalopod octopi whereas age â¥2+ individuals fed on Cephalopoda"

Their filtration efficiency is largely a function of branchio-spicule spacing of the gill rakers changing allometrically as menhaden grow (Friedland et al. 2006). Small Gulf menhaden larvae primarily feed on large phytoplankton (e.g., dinoflagellates) and some zooplankton (Govoni et al. 1983). As the larvae grow, phytoplankton become less important in the diet, and large zooplankton, especially copepods, become more important. After metamorphosis into juveniles, Gulf menhaden become filterfeeding omnivores (Table 9.10). However, some of the phytoplankton that the juvenile Gulf menhaden consume is an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest phytoplankton consumed at larval stages (Chipman 1959; June and Carlson 1971). Menhaden may also feed on their own eggs (Nelson et al. 1977), as well as eggs and larvae of other fishes and invertebrates (Peck 1893; McHugh 1967)."

In the western Atlantic Ocean, they can be found from along the U.S. Atlantic coast all the way to the south of Brazil. All of the Large Coastal Sharks can be found in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). They are considered either as part of the South Atlantic stock or as an independent stock in the assessment and management. Most species of Large Coastal Sharks use the inshore shallow waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico as their spawning and nursery grounds. They tend to move into the inshore shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico during the spring to give birth to their offspring. The inshore shallow waters provide refuges for their newborn offspring from potential predators (usually large sharks). The young sharks spend summers in the inshore waters for feeding. The preferred bottoms range from sand to mud to seagrass. Young-of-the-year sharks tend to occur more frequently in shallower water with higher temperatures, lower salinities, and more turbid conditions compared to the habitats for juveniles and adults. Small and young sharks may select these habitats as a refuge from larger and more active predators (Bethea et al. 2009). Most sharks move into warmer offshore waters in the fall. Compared to species of Small Coastal Sharks, most of the Large Coastal Sharks tend to become sexually mature at a later age. The Large Coastal Sharks group supports several important commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). Although most species are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, most stock abundances have been reduced over time. The catch quota for the Large Coastal Sharks stocks has been reduced continuously over time since the 1990s but has become relatively stable since the mid-2000s (Figure 9.75), perhaps reflecting a stabilized Large Coastal Sharks group. Sandbar and blacktip sharks are two of the most abundant and most commercially and recreationally important shark species in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). They both belong to the Large Coastal Sharks group and are widely distributed in the Gulf of Mexico. As top predators that are abundant in Gulf of Mexico coastal ecosystems, sandbar and blacktip sharks play an important role in regulating the ecosystem dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico; therefore, they were selected as representative species for evaluation."

231,1183,0.447,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"that it might not be sustained at, or expected to recover to, levels observed in the past (Jennings and Blanchard 2004). Cook and Heath (2005) examined the relationship between sea surface temperature and recruitment in a number of North Sea ï¬sh species (cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole) and concluded that if the recent warming period were to continue, as suggested by climate models, stocks which express a negative relationship with temperature (including cod) might be expected to support much smaller ï¬sheries in the future. In the case of cod, climate change has been estimated to have been eroding the maximum sustainable yield at a rate of 32,000 tonnes per decade since 1980. Calculations show that the North Sea cod stock, could still support a sustainable ï¬shery under a warmer climate but only at very much lower levels of ï¬shing mortality, and that current âprecautionary referenceâ limits or targets (such as FMSY), calculated by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on the basis of historic time series, may be unrealistically optimistic in the future. For Atlantic mackerel, increases in sea surface temperature are known to affect growth, recruitment and migration with subsequent impacts on permissible levels of exploitation (Jansen and Gislason 2011). Jansen et al. (2012) used information on larval ï¬sh from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) to show that abundance has declined dramatically in the North Sea since the 1970s and also that the spatial distribution of mackerel larvae seems to have changed. Whether these trends can be ascribed to changes in climatic conditions remains unclear, although development and/or mortality of mackerel eggs is known to be very sensitive to seawater temperature (Mendiola et al. 2007). There have been many attempts to include climatic variables in single-species population models (e.g. Hollowed et al. 2009), and thereby to project how the productivity of ï¬sh stocks will be affected by climate change in the future. Particular emphasis has been placed on climatic determinants of ï¬sh recruitment, and indeed several studies have inserted temperature or other environmental terms within the âstock-recruitâ relationship in order to make medium or long-term forecasts. Clarke et al. (2003) used projections of future North Sea temperatures and estimated the likely impact of climate change on the reproductive capacity of cod, assuming that the high level of mortality inflicted by the ï¬shing industry (in 2003) continued into the future. Outputs from the model suggested that the cod population would decline, even without a signiï¬cant temperature increase. However, scenarios with higher rates of temperature increase resulted in faster rates of decline. In a re-analysis by Kell et al. (2005), the authors modelled the effect of introducing a âcod recovery planâ (as being implemented by the European Commission), under which catches were set each year so that stock biomass increased by 30 % annually until the cod stock had recovered to around 150,000 tonnes.

231,171,0.446,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Annual production of secondary producers (formation of heterotrophic biomass) is estimated at 2â20 g C mâ2, with higher production in the northern North Sea than the Southern Bight (Fransz et al. 1991). This gradient may be because large amounts of primary production in the shallow southern areas are transferred to benthic communities and so are unavailable for consumption by zooplankton. De Wilde et al. (1992) reported a signiï¬cant decline in zooplankton abundance across the North Sea between 1960 and 1980. As shown in Fig. 1.36 this decline was followed by a subsequent recovery and then a new and ongoing decline. The long-term trend in zooplankton biomass for the North Sea as a whole is well documented through the variability observed in its sub-areas. Estimates of annual secondary and higher production for the North Sea are given in Table 1.5. The benthic fauna production estimate for Oyster Ground (36 g C mâ2 yearâ1) includes 21 g C mâ2 yearâ1 for macrofauna and 6 g C mâ2 yearâ1 for meiofauna (De Wilde et al. 1984). Biomass of brown and green algae increased in the Wadden Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat area between 1960 and 1990 (Beukema 1989; Josefson et al. 1993).

A fish population with its biomass lower than the minimum spawning stock threshold (MSST) is defined âoverfished,â meaning that the stock biomass is too low and reproductive potentials are severely depleted. For the Gulf of Mexico red snapper stock, the MFMT is defined as FSPR26% (SEDAR 7 2009), a fishing mortality (F) at which the reproductive potential is only 26 % of the maximum reproductive potential in the absence of fishing mortality and was estimated at 0.53 per year. The average F from 2006 through 2008 was 1.00, almost two times as high as the MFMT. The fishing mortality of optimal yield (FOY) was determined at 75 % of the MFMT (e.g., 0.39). Thus, recent fishing mortality was much higher than the FOY and the MFMT, suggesting that overfishing occurred in the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery prior to 2010 (SEDAR 7 2009). The stock biomass at which maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is achieved (SMSY) was estimated at 4.6 million kg (10.16 million lb), and for the Gulf of Mexico red snapper, the MSST was calculated as (1 M)SMSY, where M has a value of 0.1 per year, which yields a MSST of 4.1 million kg (9.14 million lb). The biomass as of 2008 was only 1.78, much lower than the MSST (<20 % of the MSST), suggesting that the red snapper stock biomass was severely overfished prior to 2010 (SEDAR 7 2009). Thus, the Gulf of Mexico red snapper stock was overfished, and overfishing occurred in the Gulf of Mexico prior to 2010 (Table 9.8). An early stock assessment (SEDAR 7 2005) also suggests that Gulf of Mexico red snapper were grossly overfished through 2003, and the estimated spawning potential ratio (SPR) was less than 5 %."

The coverage and quality of global marine environmental layers improves each year through a combination of remotely sensed, in situ, and modelling data. These layers and maps of marine regions are also freely available online at GMED and marineregions.org. Species trait information is being added to WoRMS, and more sample information can be added to OBIS so users can select datasets suitable for their purposes. The mapping of available data in OBIS shows how more sampling has been conducted in northern hemisphere and coastal environments compared to open-ocean, deep-sea and developing countries (Fig. 6.3a). However, because neither biodiversity nor human impacts are homogenously distributed, neither should it be expected that global sampling programmes will be. Sampling of particular guilds of biodiversity should thus be stratiï¬ed to represent its spatial variation. A major obstacle to engaging more scientists and citizens in recording marine biodiversity is the availability of guides to the identiï¬cation of species. Generally, these are only widely available for vertebrates (Costello et al. 2006, 2015b). To identify invertebrates often requires numerous papers to be obtained, sometimes in"

These Gulfcet surveys provided a more detailed knowledge of how cetaceans are affected by seasonal and interyear climatic conditions, including the presence and positions of eddies and gyres that spin off the Loop Current in the north-central Gulf and the periodic, and at times strong, fresh water incursions from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River system (Davis et al. 1998, 2002; Baumgartner et al. 2001; OrtegaOrtiz 2002). Such work has continued in the first 10 years of this century, although not always with similar multidisciplinary input as in the 1990s. The sperm whale seismic surveys (SWSS) of the first 6 years of the 2000s revealed much about sperm whale habitat in the north-central Gulf (Jochens et al. 2008), and Keith Mullin has continued to lead NMFS surveys (Maze-Foley and Mullin 2006). Studies, now better integrated year to year with standardized visual (and often acoustic) data gathering and analysis techniques, are finally giving a more complete picture of the cetaceans of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Such long-term information is allowing for assessments of community structure of pelagic cetaceans at large spatial scales, as recently attempted by Schick et al. (2011). Data for the southern Gulf are much less complete, except for an analysis by Ortega-Ortiz (2002); and for western nearshore areas in the state of Veracruz, there are analyses by Galindo et al. (2009), MartÄ±Ìnez-Serrano et al. (2011), and Valdes-Arellanes et al. (2011). The shores of Cuba are poorly represented, except for a thesis by PeÌrez-Cao (2004) from the Camagâ¬ uey Archipelago, NE Cuba, and outside of the Gulf. Studies of bottlenose dolphins in nearshore and offshore waters deserve special attention, since bottlenose dolphins of the Sarasota-Bradenton area of west Florida are arguably the longest continuously studied marine mammal (Wells and Scott 2009), vying for this distinction only with killer whales of several pods in the coastal Pacific near the U.S.âCanadian border (Ford 2009). Other studies also have been carried out, most notably by Shane off south Texas and southwest Florida (Shane 1977, 2004; Shane et al. 1986), Mullin (1988) in the north-central Gulf, and students of Wâ¬ ursig (e.g., BraÌger et al. 1994; Maze 1997; Moreno 2005) off the northwest Gulf, near Galveston Texas. Most of these studies have relied heavily on photoidentification for mark-recapture numbers analyses and society descriptions, and more is now known about the generally open, fluid social systems of bottlenose dolphins than of the social systems of most other cetaceans. The study of Caribbean (West Indian) manatee, one of only four species of the taxonomic order Sirenia (Figure 13.3) and the only vegetarians among the 122 or so species of marine mammals, had a similar early introduction by Gordon Gunter in his work with cetaceans (Gunter 1941). The monograph by Daniel Hartman (1979) on ecology and behavior of manatees in Florida (work carried out in the late 1960s) finally gave detailed information on their preferred habitats, life-history strategies, foraging techniques, and social/sexual and other aspects of behavior and behavioral ecology. While there has been much updated work (e.g., Reynolds and Odell 1991; OâShea et al. 1995; Marsh et al. 2011), this early monograph still stands as a hallmark of marine mammal studies. Since Hartman (1979), it is now known that there are two subspecies of Caribbean manateeâthe Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) (Figure 13.3). The Florida manatee regularly occurs on both sides of Florida (i.e., into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and north to about Tampa), although more rare excursions to northwest Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana occur, while the Antillean manatee occurs in the southern Mexican part of the Gulf and all the way south to (and even south of) the estuary of the Amazon River, where it is believed to hybridize with the much smaller-bodied Amazon manatee (Trichechus inunguis). Marsh et al. (2011) provide excellent up-to-date information on all Sirenia."
230,441,0.443,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.3.1.5 Marine Mammals Only one study on microplastic ingestion by marine mammals has been published to date. Bravo Rebolledo et al. (2013) recorded microplastics in stomachs (11 %, n = 100) and intestines (1 %, n = 107) of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). Direct microplastic ingestion by other species of marine mammals has not been observed. However, larger plastics items were identified in the stomachs of numerous cetaceans (46 % of all species; Baulch and Perry 2014, see also KÃ¼hn et al. 2015). The frequency of microplastic uptake by marine mammals is hitherto unknown, but could occur through filter feeding, inhalation at the water-air interface, or via trophic transfer from prey items. As baleen whales (Mysticetes) strain water between baleen plates, to trap planktonic organisms and small fish (Nemoto 1970), they may incidentally trap microplastics. Thus, their feeding mode may render baleen whales more susceptible to direct microplastic ingestion than toothed (Odotocetes) or beaked whales (Ziphiids) which are active predators of squid and fish (Pauly et al. 1998). It is also likely that marine mammals are exposed to microplastic via trophic transfer from prey species. For example, microplastics were recorded from the scats of fur seals (Arctocephalus spp.) believed to originate from lantern fish (Electrona subaspera) (Eriksson and Burton 2003). Cetaceans were suggested as sentinels for microplastic pollution (Fossi et al. 2012a; Galgani et al. 2014). However, it is notoriously difficult to extract and subsequently assess microplastics from cetacean stomachs, the often large size and decomposition rate of stomachs make sampling almost impossible. Furthermore, strandings are infrequent and unpredictable. Although adaption of sampling methods for smaller organisms such as fish and birds have the potential to be implemented, further work is necessary. The assessment of phthalate concentrations in the blubber of stranded fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (Fossi et al. 2012b, 2014) could serve as an indicator for the uptake of microplastics, but this raises other concerns as it is not possible to distinguish the origin of the phthalates. Exposure routes could be via micro- or macroplastics or simply from direct uptake of chemicals from the surrounding seawater into the blubber. Further work is essential to assess if microplastics significantly affect marine mammals."
230,573,0.441,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.2 Estimating the Economic Impacts of Marine Litter Measuring the full economic cost of marine litter is complex due to the wide range of economic, social and environmental impacts, the range of sectors impacted by marine litter and the geographic spread of those affected. Some of the impacts are easier to evaluate in economic terms because they are more direct, such as increased marine litter cleaning costs. Others are more complex, for example, the less direct and/or more intangible values such as the impacts of ecosystem deterioration or reductions in quality of life. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal complexity of the impacts related to marine litter result in costs, which may not always be immediate or conspicuous but are nevertheless significant for sustainability (National Research Council 2008). As regards ecosystem degradation, it is useful to differentiate between impacts on biodiversity (species and habitats) and the impact on the ecosystem services flowing from the ecosystem (e.g. provisioning services such as food provision, regulating services such as water and waste purification; and cultural services such as tourism and recreation). As regards economic costs it is important to differentiate between actual economic costs linked to expenditure (e.g. costs of cleanup of beaches; costs associated with damage to or loss of fishing gear or obstruction of motors; eventual cost of hospitalisation from marine debris related health impacts), economic costs of loss of output or revenue (e.g. loss of revenue from fish or loss of income from tourism) and assessment of welfare costs in economic terms (e.g. health impacts from marine debris; assessing the economic value of loss of cultural values such as recreation or landscape aesthetics). While marine litter has become an increasingly important issue in policy discussions, there is only a very sketchy (albeit growing) body of knowledge on the costs of the impacts. Because of a lack of recording even the direct economic costs of marine litter tend not to be measured (Mouat et al. 2010). Furthermore, even though there is a growing interest in ecosystem services (Costanza et al. 1997; MA 2005; TEEB 2010, 2011) little research has been done to date on the economic cost of marine litter on ecosystem service provision. Having said this, evaluations"

231,804,0.441,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"north-western North Sea, resulting in unfavourable environmental conditions (Corten 2013). A second, continuing period of weak recruitment began in 2002, when the adult population was large and exploitation low. This is ascribed to the warming of the North Sea and substantial changes in the zooplankton community described earlier in this chapter (Payne et al. 2009, 2013) which resulted in lower growth rates of larvae and hence probably lower survival. The North Sea herring population consists of several spawning components and recruitment is the sum of the survivors of many spawning events, with different spawning grounds and timing, experiencing different environmental conditions (HjÃ¸llo et al. 2009; Rijnsdorp et al. 2009). It is therefore naÃ¯ve to search for single environmental drivers; spatial and temporal differences must be taken into account, as must the influence of parental factors (Dickey-Collas et al. 2010). It is paradoxical that recruitment of both sole and plaice is higher following cold spring conditions (Ottersen et al. 2013), since plaice is close to the warm end of its range in the North Sea and sole is close to the cold end of its range. Cold temperatures in March delay spawning in sole, but it is not known whether recruitment is determined during the pelagic egg and larval stages, or during the early demersal stage (van der Land 1991; Kjesbu et al. 1998; Rijnsdorp and Witthames 2005). For plaice the higher survival during colder winters is probably related to mortality of their predators during both the pelagic and early demersal stages (Van der Veer et al."

We are deeply grateful for the contributions of the co-authors of this volume, as their expertise and experience represents the state of knowledge on the topic of aquaculture as a potential multi-use of ocean platforms. We have covered technical, operational, biological, economic, social and political considerations, as well as case studies, where aquaculture was implemented at pilot scale on offshore oil rigs and wind turbine platforms. One important area that was not covered in this book was environmental and ecological risks associated with aquaculture. While we acknowledge that environment issues are extremely important, we felt that they have been covered exhaustively over the past three decades and that further discussion would not have added new information for this volume. A recent review paper by the US Department of Commerceâs National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration (Price and Morris 2013) does an excellent job of synthesizing thirty years of literature on all environmental aspects of marine ï¬sh cage culture, so we recommend that report to readers with interest of this topic. While most environmental impacts have been associated with marine ï¬nï¬sh culture, there are some concerns with shellï¬sh and macroalgae culture though to a much lesser extent. These issues are also covered extensively in the literature (Fabia et al. 2009; Hatcher et al. 1994; Langan 2007, 2012; Lloyd 2003; Paul 1999; Plew et al. 2005; Price et al. 2015)"
231,1171,0.438,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Alheit et al. (2012), the anchovy population from the western Channel (not from the Bay of Biscay) invaded the North Sea and Baltic Sea during positive periods of the AMO. Given this evidence and according to the rules of ârelative stabilityâ within the EU Common Fisheries Policy, Spanish and French vessels would not necessarily be granted exclusive access to this expanding resource, unlike the present situation in the Bay of Biscay. Under the EU Common Fisheries Policy, a number of closed areas have been implemented as âtechnical measuresâ to conserve particular species and to protect nursery or spawning grounds. In the North Sea, these include closure areas to protect plaice, herring, Norway pout and sandeel. If species shift their distribution in response to climate change then it is possible that such measures will become less effective in the future (van Keeken et al. 2007). Juvenile plaice are typically concentrated in shallow inshore waters of the southeast North Sea and move gradually offshore as they grow. In order to reduce discarding of undersized plaice, thereby decreasing mortality and enhancing recruitment to the ï¬shery, the EU âPlaice Boxâ was introduced in 1989, excluding access to beam and otter trawlers larger than 300 hp. However recent surveys in the Wadden Sea have shown that 1-group plaice are now completely absent from the area where they were once very abundant. Consequently, the âPlaice Boxâ is now less effective as a management measure for plaice than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The boundaries of, and expected beneï¬ts from marine protected areas (MPAs) may need to be âadaptiveâ in the future in the context of climate change. Cheung et al. (2012) looked at other ï¬shery closure areas in the North Sea and noted that they will most likely experience between 2 and 3 Â°C increases in temperature over the next 80â100 years and consequently it is unlikely that the species they are designed to protect now will occur there in the same numbers in the future given deï¬ned temperature tolerances or preferences of speciï¬c ï¬shes (Freitas et al. 2007; PÃ¶rtner and Peck 2010). Fishers have witnessed and responded to a number of new opportunities in recent years, as warm-water species have moved into the North Sea and/or their exploitation has become commercially viable for the ï¬rst time. Notable examples include new or expanding ï¬sheries for seabass, red mullet, John dory Zeus faber, anchovy and squid Loligo forbesi. Biomass estimates for seabass in the eastern Channel quadrupled from around 500 tonnes in 1985, to in excess of 2100 tonnes in 2004/2005, with populations also increasing rapidly in the southern North Sea (Pawson et al. 2007). This was attributed to an increase in seawater temperature, especially in the winter and has resulted in a dramatic expansion of seabass ï¬sheries both within the commercial sector and the recreational ï¬shing sector. Seabass are caught by angling on the east coast of Scotland and in Norway, but"

These warmer water species have all reappeared or increased in abundance over the past thirty years. Declining catches since the fourteenth century from accessible nearshore areas of the North Sea led to the development of ever more distant ï¬sheries at Iceland, in the NW Atlantic and in the Barents Sea, to feed the growing human population."

Texas processing was at the level with such a small number of firms that reporting it separately would divulge confidential data. From 2006 forward, the Texas data had to be combined with the Louisiana data to maintain confidentiality. Gulf blue crab processing data exists for Alabama, Louisiana/Texas, and Florida west coast. The 2007â2009 average Alabama processed production was six times larger than the next largest, Louisiana/Texas. Recalling the level of landings in Alabama being a 3-year average of approximately ten million pounds, points to significant cross state movement of live blue crab. The 4 % of average Gulf landings clearly would not support the Alabama processing industryâs 4.2 million pounds of blue crab meat. It is an inescapable conclusion that Louisiana was the only state that could have supplied sufficient live crabs for Alabama to attain such a high processed volume."
230,674,0.435,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"15.4 Potential Gaps in Marine Litter Management As previously described, a basic regulatory and management framework addressing marine litter is in place and a number of regions and countries have taken management measures to tackle the issues. A few cases indicate that some of the management measures have generated desirable results, such as South Koreaâs fishing gear buyback programme, Taiwanâs plastic restriction policy and compulsory garbage sorting policy, US Fish for Energy, OSPAR Fishing for Litter, EU PRF Directive, HELCOM Baltic Strategy (see previous sections). Despite this, marine litter continues to increase worldwide: on shorelines, in estuaries and mangroves, in oceanic gyres, and on seafloors, signalling that marine litter remains an abiding problem, particularly with respect to microplastics (Barnes et al. 2009; UNEP 2011; Lima et al. 2014; Mohamed Nor and Obbard 2014; Pham et al. 2014; Lusher 2015). There are complex reasons for this and, it is possible to identify a number of gaps in the current framework that prevent the effective control of marine litter. â¢ Limits of existing instruments in addressing plastic marine litter Gold et al. (2013) identified a number of limitations in existing international instruments in addressing marine litter, including their insufficient scope with respect to the main sources of plastic pollution, exemptions and lack of enforcement standards. For instance, UNCLOS acknowledges the existence of landbased sources but simply requests that countries address the problem through domestic means.44 MARPOL Annex V exempts accidental loss of disposal of plastic resulting from damage to the ship or its equipment,45 as well as ships <400 GT, a category to which most of the fishing vessels belong, from recoding garbage discharge operations in Garbage Record Books (GRBs).46 However, GRBs are of utmost importance to ensure compliance with discharge regulations (HELCOM 2012). The lack of enforcement standards can be found in the terms used in the legal instruments. UNCLOS, for instance, requires only that nations âshall endeavorâ to use the âbest practical meansâ to reduce marine pollution âin accordanceâ with their capabilities. Similarly, the Helsinki Convention requires contracting parties to take âall appropriateâ measures to prevent and eliminate pollution. This leaves room for interpretation for countries with differing legal systems, environmental circumstances and capacities (Gold et al. 2013). â¢ Deficiencies in the legislation and a lack of implementation and enforcement of regulations and management measures The implementation and enforcement of regulations and management measures at national levels is a key component to combat marine litter. However, a number"

If birds cannot alter their timing sufï¬ciently or climate change makes historically adaptive cues maladaptive, then populations may suffer (Visser 2008). Focusing on coastal birds, there appears to be no general pattern in how timing of egg laying has responded, with for example northern lapwings Vanellus vanellus showing no response over the past decades, while egg laying in Eurasian oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus advanced in response to increased rainfall, and in ringed plovers Charadrius hiaticula advanced in response to rising temperatures (Crick and Sparks 1999). Studies have also identiï¬ed various cases where interannual variability in demographic rates was associated with climatic variability. The most common pattern is that annual juvenile and/or adult survival is strongly positively related to winter temperatures in many coastal birds (e.g. Peach et al. 1994; Yalden and Pearce-Higgins 1997; Atkinson et al. 2000). By contrast, a review has suggested that populations"
231,819,0.433,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"show that birds would beneï¬t most from adapting their nest-site selection to higher areas. However, historically the lower saltmarsh has been favoured for its proximity to the feeding grounds and for its low vegetation, aiding predator detection. Van de Pol et al. (2010) concluded that it is more difï¬cult for birds to infer that habitat quality has decreased from changes in the frequency of rare and unpredictable extreme events than from trends in climatic means. The result is, at present, that the lower parts of the saltmarsh may function as an ecological trap."

Aquatic organisms for which ingestion of microplastics has been documented in the field include those from across the marine food web, including turtles, seabirds, fish, crustaceans and worms (reviewed by Wright et al. 2013). Laboratory studies have confirmed that many other organisms have the capacity to ingest microplastics including zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013; SetÃ¤lÃ¤ et al. 2012). The majority of studies have documented microplastics in the guts of organisms, an organ that is not generally consumed directly by humans."

This is expected given the large proportion of the Gulf catch in number of fish is represented by Louisiana. As previously discussed, the catch of red drum by Louisianaâs anglers in numbers of fish (A + B1 + B2) accounts for the majority of the Gulf catch (excluding Texas). As such, it should come as no surprise that Louisianaâs recreational harvest of red drum in pounds (A + B1) dominates the Gulf (Figure 10.119). Overall, Louisianaâs annual recreational red drum harvest in pounds generally ranges from about 8 million pounds to 11 million pounds, which represents about 80 % of the Gulf total (excluding Texas). The stateâs share of the Gulf total in pounds harvested is marginally higher than its share in number of fish reflecting primarily larger bag limits in Louisiana and a larger sized fish being harvested.26"

169,578,0.431,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"â¢ Fishes are present in most surface waters except in cases of stream size and migration restrictions. â¢ The identiï¬cation of ï¬shes is relatively easy, and their taxonomy, ecological requirements, and life histories are generally better known than in other species groups. â¢ Fish presence corresponds strongly to changes in hydrological and environmental ï¬ow patterns, while other biological quality elements (e.g., macroinvertebrates) hardly indicate these impacts. â¢ Fishes have evolved complex migration patterns, making them sensitive to continuum interruptions. â¢ The longevity of many ï¬sh species enables assessments to be sensitive to disturbance over relatively long time scales. â¢ The natural history and sensitivity to disturbances are well documented for many species, and their responses to environmental stressors are often known. â¢ Fishes generally occupy high trophic levels and thus integrate conditions of lower trophic levels. In addition, different ï¬sh species represent distinct trophic levels: omnivores, herbivores, insectivores, planktivores, and piscivores. â¢ Fishes occupy a variety of habitats in rivers: benthic, pelagic, rheophilic, limnophilic, etc. Species have speciï¬c habitat requirements and thus exhibit predictable responses to human-induced habitat alterations. â¢ Depressed growth and recruitment are easily assessed and reï¬ect stress. â¢ Fishes are valuable economic resources and are of public concern. Using ï¬shes as indicators confers an easy and intuitive understanding of cause effect relationships to stakeholders beyond the scientiï¬c community. There is a common agreement that the performance of any biological assessment approach increases with the quality rating of its ecological background (Verdonschot and Moog 2006). Consequentially there was a remarkable increase of taxa lists that associated ecological information with indicator taxa in the last 10â15 years. These taxa lists include functional ecosystem characteristics, species traits, and others more in ecological assessment (see Chap. 20)."
34,503,0.43,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","information in Figure 10.45, Gulf production during the 20-year period ending in 2009 fluctuated from less than 13 million pounds (1990 and 1991) to more than 25 million pounds (2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004). Abnormally low production in 1990 was most likely the result of drought conditions throughout Louisiana, which lasted for several years beginning in the mid-1980s. This drought came to an abrupt end in 1991 with a record rainfall. While initially resulting in high oyster mortality as a result of low salinity conditions throughout the stateâs estuary systems, the pulse of fresh water was, in the long run, beneficial to the oyster population. Gulf production was also relatively low in 2005 and 2006 due, primarily, to a reduction in harvests in Mississippi and Louisiana. This decline can be directly related to Hurricane Katrina (and to a lesser extent Hurricane Rita), which made landfall around the Mississippi/Louisiana border in August of 2005 (Mississippi was forced to close its state waters to all oyster harvesting in 2006). Similarly, when Hurricane Ike entered around Galveston Bay in 2008, there was a significant loss of infrastructure that resulted in a reduction in Texas production in that year and in 2009. This had a significant impact on production from Texas given the fact that about 80 % of the Texas production is generally taken from this one water body. Despite some significant year-to-year variations in state annual production, each stateâs relative share of the regionâs overall total has remained extremely stable when considered in 10-year increments (Table 10.1). For example, Louisianaâs share of the regionâs production remained at 57 % during both 10-year periods while Texasâs share remained at about 21 %. A Closer Look at the Louisiana Oyster Harvesting System: Louisianaâs large annual oyster harvest is derived from a combination of production from leases and public seed grounds. By providing a stable environment through its leasing policy, the state has encouraged industry investment and has provided an impetus for the preservation, rehabilitation, and expansion of existing leases. Overall, Louisianaâs leased acreage has expanded approximately fivefold since the early 1960s, from about 75,000 acres (30,350 ha) to about 400,000 acres (161,875 ha) (OTTF 2012). Despite this increase in acreage, long-run production from this leased acreage has remained relatively constant at about eight million pounds per year. Increasing leased acreage in conjunction with relatively constant long-run production from the leased acreage implies, of course, declining productivity per acre. This may be the result of several factors including (1) the recently added acreage is not as productive as the older acreage, (2) older leases are no longer as productive as in past years, (3) the average productivity of all leased acreage is declining, and (4) some amalgam of these factors. One argument that has been advanced to explain the increased leased acreage in conjunction with the relatively stable long-run production is that the increased acreage being leased is in response to wetland degradation and increasing rapid fluctuations in salinity regimes. Specifically, with the increasing exposure of Table 10.1. 10-Year Average Annual Oyster Production in Pounds for Each Gulf State and Its Share (%) of Gulf of Mexico Production Florida"

241,108,0.43,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"1.2.4.2 Coastal Ecosystems, Birds, and Forests The ecosystems of the extensive coastal zone of the Baltic Sea are relatively unstable, owing particularly to land uplift and the effects of sea-level rise and drainage basin processes. Furthermore, human influences from the often densely populated coastal areas exert a wide range of impacts on this area. Land use varies greatly within the Baltic Sea drainage basin. The most notable contrast is between the agricultural south and the forested north. Some of the ecosystem responses are speciï¬c to the relatively simply structured brackish water ecosystems of the Baltic Sea. The high diversity of the regional geography and distribution of the different habitats must be considered when assessing ongoing and possible future change patterns. The combined effects of climate change and land uplift on coastal ecosystems have been little studied and need particular emphasis in the future. Warmer terrestrial ecosystems and warmer coastal sea water affect the northward migration of terrestrial and aquatic species and result in longer reproductive periods for coastal fauna and flora. The biodiversity of the Baltic Sea is particularly sensitive to changes in salinity, which can have a cascading effect on food webs and interaction between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The effects of climate change on salinity and water temperature can facilitate invasion by non-indigenous aquatic bird species, such as cormorants, which can cause major changes in coastal bird communities. The climate-mediated changes can also facilitate the invasion of mammalian predators which can cause major changes in coastal and archipelago ecosystems. The positive impacts of climate change on forest growth are expected to continue. In relative terms, boreal forest stands may beneï¬t more from climate change than temperate forest stands."

Both Vereshchaka and Vinogradov (1999) and Skebo et al. (2006) used in situ visual observations, which should have allowed them to gather information on the fragile ctenophores and larvaceans. However, although the former authors showed that gelatinous animals and radiolarians can dominate plankton biomass throughout the water column, particularly just above and below the main core of the hydrothermal vent plume, at the Broken Spur vent field, mid-Atlantic ridge, and the latter authors also found significant differences in jellyfish abundances between the near-field and far-field areas, the level of taxonomic resolution was only at the Phylum level. The midwater and benthopelagic fauna occurring around deep sea chemosynthetic ecosystems is therefore somewhat of a black box, even though the predation pressure on vent-derived larvae exerted by its inhabitants may be considerable. The taxonomy of these soft-bodied predators is difficult and the information needed to correctly identify many of the species is scattered throughout the literature in a variety of languages. In the present paper we analysed the video record from ten dives of the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) HyperDolphin around the Hatoma Knoll hydrothermal vent site (approx. 21 51.450 N 123 50.450 E) and give taxonomic treatments and other information on the gelatinous zooplankton that were observed, in order to stimulate and facilitate further work. As it is not yet known at what depths the larvae of each vent species inhabit during development, we give a synopsis of the gelatinous zooplankton that could eat released eggs and newly-hatched larvae (eg. larvaceans, lobate ctenophores) as well as those that would be expected to prey on larvae nearing their settlement phase (eg. siphonophores and cydippid ctenophores), and their potential predators, in turn. Where a video record existed, it was analyzed from the benthopelagic layers near the vent plumes right up to the near surface layer."

(2014) found over 50 % of amphibians exported via Hong Kong International Airport were infected with ranavirus. Reptiles infected with ranaviruses also have been discovered in internationally traded animals (Hyatt et al. 2002; StÃ¶hr et al. 2013b, 2015). Finally, internationally traded ornamental fishes have been shown to be infected with ranaviruses (Hedrick and McDowell 1995). While the outcome of infection varies among hosts and strains of ranaviruses, it is clear that ranaviruses have the potential to cause population declines and extinctions (Teacher et al. 2010; Price et al. 2014; Earl and Gray 2014). They may present a significant threat to host species that are geographically isolated or exist at low abundance (Heard et al. 2013; Price et al. 2014; Earl and Gray 2014). Thus, highly susceptible host species that are rare may be at greatest risk (Earl and Gray 2014). However, common species also can be affected. For example, populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria) have declined on average 80 % in the UK where ranavirus die-offs have reoccurred (Teacher et al. 2010). It is therefore important to understand the geographic extent, host range, and phylogenetic relationships of these emerging pathogens (Jancovich et al. 2015)."

Economic conditions by 2009 were not favorable, resulting in an index of 65 (i.e., price was 35 % below 1982). When examined at the state level, the dockside value of all landings is highly concentrated in Louisiana and Texas with shares of 43 % and 26 %, respectively. The other state achieving a double-digit contribution is Florida (west coast) at 19 %. Alabama and Mississippi range from 6 to 7 % of Gulf value. Species components of the state values are widely different. Louisiana value of individual fisheries for white shrimp, blue crab, oysters, and menhaden leads among the states. For example, the commercial dockside value of Louisianaâs white shrimp landings averaged $96.3 million annually during 2007â2009, which exceeded the combined values for all other states (Figure 10.9 left panel). Similarly, the 2007â2009 annual average commercial value of Louisianaâs blue crab landings ($34 million) and oyster landings ($43.4 million) exceeded the combined landings from all other Gulf states (Figure 10.9 right panel). The remaining key species, brown shrimp, is dominated by Texas landings (with an average dockside value of $87.8 million during 2007â2009), followed by Louisiana ($29.2 million) and Alabama ($21.8 million) (Figure 10.9 left panel). Key species designation of the five species fits well for all but Florida (west coast). At 19 % of total Gulf value, the area only receives 11 % of its landed value from key species. Edible finfish such as groupers and snapper bring high finfish dockside prices. These species and highly valued spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) and stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) claws push the west coastâs share in the Gulf (19 %) past that depicted by key species alone (3 %)."

Subsequently, a moratorium was placed on the issuance of new permits and, according to unpublished NMFS records, a total of 1,907 vessels were permitted under the Gulf shrimp moratorium permit in 2009 (i.e., the upper-bound estimate of the number of vessels that would be legally allowed to shrimp in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico). Of this total, 693 of the vessels, or more than one-third of the total, were home-ported in Texas. Louisiana ranked second (545 permits; 29 %), followed by Florida (278 permits; 15 %), Mississippi (164 permits), and Alabama (149 permits). While the number of permits equaled about 1,900 in 2009, Liese and Travis (2010) report that only about 1,215 of these actively harvested shrimp in 2009. In addition to those vessels holding a Gulf shrimp moratorium permit, which is required for shrimping in federal waters, a large number of boats shrimp only in the state waters. Based on state license sales, Miller and Isaacs (2011) estimate that the population of inshore shrimpers, excluding those that had a Gulf shrimp moratorium permit, approximated 3,765 in 2009.

The importance of taxonomy in protecting species is most immediately visible under the Convention for International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) agreement. With 179 Parties having now joined the Convention, to which they agree to voluntarily adhere, CITES provides a rank system with varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 plant and animal species. Under CITES, all Acerodon and Pteropus species, or flying foxes, are listed as Appendix I or II. Appendix I species are deemed as threatened by extinction and all international trade is prohibited except for non-commercial purposes (e.g., scientific research). Appendix II affords protection to species that are not currently threatened, but may become threatened without controlled trade. Appendix II also protects similar-looking species in order to discourage illegal wildlife trafficking. All members of Acerodon and Pteropus are listed at both the genus and species level because many species have very restricted ranges and some are endangered, but species identificationâespecially by non-expertsâis extremely difficult. The only nonpteropodid currently listed by CITES is the Uruguay population of the whitelined broad-nosed bat (Platyrrhinus lineatus), which is listed under Appendix III. Appendix III species are protected within a signatory country, but that signatory country has indicated it requires extended cooperation from other countries to prevent exploitation. The importance of taxonomy in international agreements is also evident in the Convention on Migratory Speciesâ (CMS) EUROBATS Agreement, which originally recognized 37 species, but now includes all 52 bat species (both migratory and non-migratory) in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. EUROBATS sets legal protection standards and develops and promotes management and conservation strategies across international borders, with 35 of 63 states within the targeted range as signatories. Revisions to the number of species listed, with an increase of 7 new species since 1995, are due to continuing taxonomic work in the region (CMS 2013)."

Model results were tested against the long, spatially-resolved time series from the CPR and against detailed seasonal sampling of vertical distribution of life history stages. Increasing temperature is a major factor in observed changes in Calanus phenology, but changes in abundance are also influenced by advection of C. ï¬nmarchicus through the northern boundary of the North Sea, which is to some degree climate-related. The detailed observational time series available for the North Sea allow testing of quite complex process models on scales encompassing regional physical dynamics, water column processes and species life history. Observed changes in distribution and phenology are consistent with global patterns (Poloczanska et al. 2013), but there are important processes occurring at regional and local scales that modify the simple global pattern. It is probably too early to judge whether adaptive responses by marine zooplankton will keep pace with the current rapid changes in climate (Dam 2013). The observational time series for North Sea plankton are longer and have better temporal and spatial coverage and resolution than any other in the world. Since many taxa have plankton life stages these time series can be used to analyse long-term change not only in holoplankton, but also in meroplankton, including benthic species and ï¬sh, and examples are given in later sections."

231,787,0.424,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"It has long been known that many intertidal rocky shore species reach their biogeographic limits around the British Isles (Forbes 1858; Hawkins et al. 2009) and changes in the distribution of intertidal species on rocky shores have been related to climate variability and change for decades. For example, the relative abundance of two barnacle species during the early twentieth centuryâBalanus balanoides, a Boreal-Arctic species that reaches its southern limit in the SW British Isles and Chthamalus stellatus, a LusitanianTropical species that reaches its northern limit in Scotlandâ was shown to be related to warm and cold periods (Southward and Crisp 1954). Recent surveys have updated these historic records and show that a number of warm-temperate rocky shore species have extended (or re-extended) their northern limits since the abrupt warming of the late 1980s (Southward et al. 1995; Mieszkowska et al. 2006). It seems that more southern, warm-water species have been recorded advancing polewards than northern, cold-water species retreating (Hawkins et al. 2009). Responses seem to be species- and habitat-speciï¬c, with the likelihood of range extensions determined by a combination of life history traits including reproductive mode, fecundity, larval behaviour and larval duration, all of which have the potential to influence dispersal capability. In contrast to plankton in open pelagic systems, it is unlikely that whole assemblages of intertidal rocky shore species will shift simultaneously (Hawkins et al. 2009) owing to their speciï¬c requirements in terms of degree of exposure, vertical zonation and substrate attachment."

In contrast to the previous lower-tier assessments that indicated potential adverse effects in aquatic organisms (Giesy et al. 1999), this paper relied on higher and more refined tiers of risk assessment. Effects of CPY on aquatic organisms were evaluated by comparing measured or modeled concentrations of CPY in aquatic environments to species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), cosm no observed ecologically adverse effect concentrations (NOAECeco), or individual toxicity values where sufficient data to derive a SSD were not available (Giddings et al. 2014).

This nematode is acquired by the croaker as well as numerous other fishes (Fusco and Overstreet 1978) when it feeds on copepods such as harpacticoids, the white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus) (see Fusco 1980), Atlantic brief squid (Lolliguncula brevis), and probably other hosts. Patterns of mean abundance, the number of the nematodes in all the croaker examined, whether infected or not, over time suggest the populations of this parasite exhibit extreme seasonal and annual variability, with some time periods exhibiting heavily infected croaker, whereas other periods exhibit few, if any, specimens of S. cricotus (Figure 14.55). Over the course of decades, both prevalence (% infected) and mean intensity of this parasite infecting croaker varied. In total, 1,307 croaker examined for this chapter had 2,193 individual S. cricotus from the 1970s and 1990s. In the early 1970s, prevalence of a sample reached as high as 74.6 %. In contrast, prevalence of S. cricotus in Atlantic croaker from the later 1970s was as low as 1.7 %. Low prevalence was also generally encountered during the 1990s when some collections, such as that in April of 1992, demonstrated no S. cricotus. Fluctuations of S. cricotus over time do not appear to be strongly driven by either water temperature or salinity. The period of highest mean abundances occurred during the early 1970s (Figure 14.55). In subsequent years, this parasite was less abundant, even when environmental conditions were similar to the period when abundances were high. The lack of S. cricotus in later time periods suggests a decrease in either the presence or consumption of infected intermediate hosts by Atlantic croaker, different susceptibilities to infection, differences in host density, or different climatic conditions after the early 1970s. The potential mechanisms for this difference could be numerous; however, this lack of coherence, a reliable estimate of mean abundance under normal conditions, over time would hinder before-and-after comparisons of parasite population structure in relation to environmental disruptions (see review by Underwood 1994). While the mechanism driving patterns of S. cricotus mean abundance in croaker remains unknown, the presence of a decline following the early 1970s was still apparent in the 1990s (Figure 14.55). In addition, abundance of S. cricotus often peaked within a time period during the early spring and summer months during the two periods in the 1970s and 1990s. The changes in abundance that occur on a seasonal basis would represent a further impediment to beforeâ andâafter comparisons of environmental disruption since this may necessarily involve comparing different seasons within a year. The decrease in S. cricotus over time is most clearly illustrated when comparing late spring and early summer months from the three time periods with one another and using that comparison to control for possible confounding seasonal effects. Even in cases where similar salinities occurred during the same months such as the spring and early summer months of the early 1970s and 1990s, mean abundance of S. cricotus was different, and that would suggest mechanisms besides those directly or indirectly related to either salinity or seasonality. In addition to abundance, prevalence and mean intensity also varied among time periods. Between March and June of 1971, prevalence ranged from 71 to 75 % with mean intensity varying from 3.3 to 7.2 worms/infected host. In the same months in 1976, prevalence was from 10 to 50 %, with mean intensity ranging from 2.6 to 3.9. In the 1990s, prevalence during the spring and early summer ranged between 0 and 44 %, with infected croaker harboring 3.2â3.7 worms/host. Thus, the shift in S. cricotus that is the result of changes in prevalence, intensity, and abundance suggests either changes in food web structure among and within time periods or physiological alterations in host immune response, but the pathway remains unresolved. Currently, a study is in progress that will include more data that will allow for comparisons between polluted and non-polluted areas of coastal Mississippi, including the relatively"

No data exist to determine whether proportion of time birds spend on fields. treated fields equates to the proportion of their diet that comes from treated fields. The various shortcomings with the PT variable could ultimately lead to under- or over-estimation of risk.

The pulmonary receptor for both brevetoxins and brevenal seems to be distinct from the neuronal binding site. In other words, the multiple biotoxins and antagonists interact with at least neuronal, pulmonary, and enzymatic regulatory systems of animals, generating a complex combination of acute and chronic signs in animals, including humans, exposed to aerosolized bioactive substances produced by K. brevis. Most data on Florida red tide fish kills acquired up to the last decade or so were anecdotal and qualitative but useful. Gannon et al. (2009) investigated the effects of the algal blooms on nearshore fish communities in five habitats in Sarasota Bay and adjacent areas. They looked at the cell density of K. brevis as well as data on fish density, fish species composition, water temperature and salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. The clupeid (herring-like fish) trophic guild (a guild [or ecological guild] consists of any group of species that exploit the same resources) was not affected by the cell density of the toxic algae as were all other eight fish trophic guilds. Fish density as measured by catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species richness of those other eight guilds all had a negative association with the algal cell density; 96 % of the local fish kills from 2003 to 2007 (ranging from 4 in 2007 to 72 in 2005, with more nearby) occurred during red tides. The guild consisting of the demersal invertebrate feeders was the most sensitive to the effects of the red tide, whereas the clupeids were the least sensitive, and, when excluding the clupeids, the difference between CPUE in red tide period versus non-red tide period ranged from 57 % in the mangrove habitat to 88 % in the GoM habitat. Fisheriesindependent monitoring data (as opposed to fishery-dependent data, which are data collected directly from commercial and recreational fisheries sources) from the Tampa Bay area collected from 1996 through 2006, with an emphasis on the persistent red tide of 2005, analyzed by Flaherty and Landsberg (2011) showed that in the spring of 2006 there was a decline in the annual recruitment of juvenile spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). However, the subadult and adult abundance values for these fishes remained consistent with those of previous years. The respective recruitment periods of some of the other fishes did not correspond with the major red tide event. The importance of clupeid fishes such as Spanish sardines, thread herrings, and Atlantic shad in the understanding of fish kills has been recognized by Walsh et al. (2009). The dinoflagellate K. brevis requires nutrients to form the catastrophic blooms. A nitrogen isotope budget of the coastal food web shows that diazotrophs (nitrogen fixers, primarily the filamentous cyanobacteria Trichodesmium spp.) form the initial nutrient source of red tides and clupeiformes (decomposing dead sardines, herrings, and bay anchovies) serve as the major recycled nutrient source for the maintenance of those blooms. In 2001, the dinoflagellate âharvestedâ >90 % of the clupeids along the West Florida Shelf rather than being harvested by fishermen. Fish kills typically originate when K. brevis cells lyse and release their toxins, which become absorbed directly across the gill membranes. Fish may also die after ingesting the dinoflagellate cells or toxins in the water, or after consuming contaminated biota (Landsberg et al. 2009). The Center for Prediction of Red Tides (CPR) in Florida (Walsh et al. 2009) has developed models to assess and predict red tides based on nitrogen isotope ratios in portions of the food web that maintain K. brevis. The food web associated with K. brevis has shown to be extremely complicated and differs somewhat in different areas based on currents and winds. Some model components are based on features such as temperature. At summer temperatures, as much as 50 % of some Florida fish decay to inorganic forms of phosphorus and nitrogen within 1 day (Stevenson and Childers 2004; Walsh et al. 2009). Some clupeids can provide about 50 % of the nitrogen supply for red tides. Of equal concern is the nearly equal inclusion of the diatom-"

Lastly, as noted above, ranaviruses may persist in the environment long enough to be transmitted to naÃ¯ve hosts. Perhaps more importantly, fish, amphibians and reptiles often overlap with other, less susceptible or more abundant species that act as biotic reservoirs for the species of interest. Collectively, there is good reason to think that ranaviruses can lead to host extinction (Miller et al. 2011). In spite of this potential for ranaviruses to cause host extinctions, it is difficult to find specific examples of ranavirus leading to regional or global extinctions or, until recently, declines. Few long-term datasets exist that have followed wild populations of ectothermic vertebrates with reoccurring die-offs from ranavirus, and at least for amphibians, long datasets are often required to be certain of declines (Alford and Richards 1999). To some degree this may be explained by the fact that ranaviruses often affect the larval or juvenile stages (see Sects. 2.1 and 3.3) and for many taxa these stages can be less important demographically than adults (Biek et al. 2002). We would thus expect populations or species where the adults were most affected by ranaviruses to display the greatest declines (but see Earl and Gray 2014). Indeed, Teacher et al. (2010) reported an 81 % median reduction in population abundance of common frog (Rana temporaria) adults at ponds in the UK with known reoccurring die-offs from ranaviral disease. Again, ranaviruses in the UK appear to primarily affect adults (Cunningham et al. 1993; Teacher et al. 2010; Duffus et al. 2013). Similarly, the significant ranavirus mortality observed in adult turtles presumably puts these populations at increased risk of extinction as well (Belzer and Seibert 2011; Farnsworth and Seigel 2013). Repeated ranavirus epidemics in larval amphibians may also lead to declines and local extinctions. Petranka et al. (2003, 2007), for instance, reported minimal recruitment of wood frogs at several newly constructed wetlands over an 8-year period due to annual die-offs from ranaviral disease. Recently, Earl and Gray (2014) used a matrix population-projection model to demonstrate that local extirpation of a closed wood frog population was likely if larvae or metamorphs were exposed to ranavirus once every 5 years. For populations that were exposed every year, time to extinction could be as rapid as 5 years (Earl and Gray 2014). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that survival of the pre-metamorphic stages was more important than post-metamorphic stages for the wood frog, providing initial evidence that significant mortality of larvae due to ranavirus could lead to population extinction (Earl and Gray 2014). Susceptible species in fragmented landscapes with limited dispersal may be at greater risk of extinction than has been previously recognized (Collins and Crump 2009). The most compelling example of recurring ranavirus epidemics leading to amphibian declines comes from the Picos de Europa National park in Spain (Price et al. 2014). These communities were monitored for six years, during which ranaviruses were apparently introduced, leading to significant declines over the following years. What makes these virus-host community interactions different from others that have not suffered declines remains unknown. Clearly, there is a need for more studies of the population-level effects of ranavirus outbreaks, particularly long-term studies of sites with reoccurring ranavirus die-offs (Gray et al. 2015)."
222,61,0.421,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment showed in detail how many ecosystem services across the world are under stress and in decline. These trends are apparent in delta regions under stress (Nicholls et al. 2016). In the GBM delta, for example, there are high levels of soil and water salinity (Amoako Johnson et al. 2016). Globally, mangrove areas have been in significant decline, and natural habitats for aquatic species have shown stress due to over-exploitation and pollution (Polidoro et al. 2010). Deltas are distinct in terms of the concentration of freshwater, nutrients and especially sediment inputs to a small concentrated area of the coastal zone, creating conditions ideal for fertile ecosystems, dense population and high economic activity (Bianchi 2016). Associated ecosystem services are high in number and include benefits such as productive agriculture and aquaculture, water provision and physical protection from the periodic impacts of extreme events such as coastal storms and cyclones. Ecosystem services can act as a safety net for poor populations. Akter and Mallick (2013) show in the GBM region that those populations"

We treat it separately because of its relationship with health. Since parasites comprise about half the Earthâs biota, they form a critical component of biodiversity of the Gulf. An abundance of parasites, with an emphasis on helminths, indicates a healthy ecosystem or a healthy host species. This method provides an especially powerful marker because most helminths have three, plus or minus two hosts, in a specific cycle. Consequently, the presence of that specific helminth in a habitat indicates that all members of the cycle are or had recently been present in the habitat. Because of this cycle, the absence of helminths provides indicators of disruption. The reason for the indication is that adverse impacts on the corresponding intermediate host (or final host) for the species or the population result in fewer species or smaller parasite populations. Fewer parasite species or parasite populations show there was a disruption, even if it was not otherwise apparent."

35,468,0.419,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Declining catches of Atlantic cod lead to a growing interest in aquaculture of this species. For more than thirty years, the intensive production of cod has been established (Moksness et al. 2004). The rearing of G. morhua requires the production of live food of different sizes and feeding protocols need to be followed strictly (Moksness et al. 2004). Of all the gadoid species, cod is thought to have the greatest potential for future development for aquaculture and some scientists believe that within the next 20 years similarly high production levels can be achieved as for the Atlantic salmon (Rosenlund and Skretting 2006). The suitability of G. morhua for offshore aquaculture has been successfully demonstrated in 3000 m3 submersible cages including automatic feeding buoys by the company Sea Stationâ¢ off the coast of New Hampshire (Chambers and Howell 2006). As G. morhua is a physoclist species, necessary pauses need to be included during vertical movements of the cage (KorsÃ¸en 2011). One major problem for cod aquaculture is their ability to bite through the mesh or other materials, which makes them the ï¬sh species with the highest escapee rate (Jensen et al. 2010), which could have a negative impact on wild population by cross-breeding (Davies et al. 2008). The extreme temperature tolerance range from â1 to 23 Â°C and an optimum temperature range from 8 to 12 Â°C (Jobling 1988) make this species a candidate for aquaculture in the German Bight. However, aquaculture companies should be aware that the relatively high summer temperatures in the German Bight could enhance the risk of infections, as G. morhua is prone to bacterial ï¬sh pathogens such as Franciscella spec. or Aeromonas salmonicidae at prolonged temperatures of more than 12 Â°C (Buck et al. 2012)."

231,182,0.419,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.9 Non-indigenous Species Many studies report the occurrence of non-indigenous species in the North Sea that may have been introduced via ballast water from cargo ships, shipping or mariculture. Some new species are also reported that were misidentiï¬ed in the past (GÃ³mez, 2008). Two examples of imported species are the American comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi ï¬rst recorded in the North Sea in 2006 (Faasse and Bayha 2006) and the Paciï¬c oyster Crassostrea gigantea which was introduced in the 1980s on selected plots in the Wadden Sea used for cultivation of shellï¬sh (Drinkwaard 1998). A combination of over-exploitation of native oyster Ostrea edulis and import of the Paciï¬c oyster has almost driven the former to vanish (Reise et al. 2010). Jellyï¬sh concentrations are expected to increase across the entire North Sea in the next 100 years, owing to the projected rise in water temperature and fall in pH (Attrill et al. 2007; Blackford and Gilbert 2007). The ability of jellyï¬sh to reproduce in a short time may affect pelagic and coastal ecosystems (Purcell 2005; SchlÃ¼ter et al. 2010). An example of a non-indigenous phytoplankton species that is now well established in the North Sea is the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii, which originated in the Paciï¬c Ocean (Edwards et al. 2001; Wiltshire et al. 2010). 1.6.3.10 Climate Change Chapters 3 and 6 provide a detailed description of climate change in the marine system. The following examples show that biological and physical effects of climate change are probably already being observed within the North Sea. Major south-north changes in distribution and abundance related to rising temperatures have been detected for two key calanoid copepods, the cold-water species Calanus ï¬nmarchicus and the warm-water species C. helgolandicus (Planque and Fromentin 1996). Annual abundance of C. ï¬nmarchicus, which was usually high in the northern North Sea, decreased and the population has shifted north out of the North Sea (Beaugrand et al. 2009). Former high abundance of C. helgolandicus in the central and southern North Sea declined in that area and higher abundances were found further north (HelaouÃ«t and Beaugrand 2007). During the summer period after the onset of stratiï¬cation decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom water at the North Dogger and Oyster Grounds were observed related to an increase in seasonal bottom water temperature (Greenwood et al. 2010)."

230,394,0.419,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.1 Introduction With the increasing reliance on plastics as an everyday item, and rapid increase in their production and subsequent disposal, the environmental implications of plastics are a growing concern. The benefits of plastics, including their durability and resistance to degradation, inversely result in negative environmental impacts. As user-plastics are primarily âsingle useâ items they are generally disposed of within one year of production, and whilst some plastic waste is recycled, the majority ends up in land-fill. Concerns arise when plastics enter the marine environment through indiscriminate disposal and it has been estimated that up to 10 % of plastic debris produced will enter the sea (Thompson 2006). Interactions between litter and the marine environment are complex. The impacts of larger plastic debris are discussed by KÃ¼hn et al. (2015) and consequences include aesthetic, social and economic issues (Newman et al. 2015), and numerous environmental impacts on marine biota (Derraik 2002; Barnes et al. 2009). However, with an ever increasing reliance on plastic products, and as plastic production, use and disposal continue, microplastics are of increasing concern (Sutherland et al. 2010). Microplastics enter the sea from a variety of sources (Browne 2015) and distributed by oceans currents; these ubiquitous contaminants are widespread (CÃ³zar et al. 2014). The amount of microplastics in the sea will continue to rise, leading to gradual but significant accumulation in coastal and marine environments (Andrady and Neal 2009). Increasing evidence of microplastics in the sea has led to a need to understand its environmental impacts as a form of marine pollution. A recent review of marine debris research found only 10 % of publications to focus on microplastics, the majority of which were from the last decade (CBD 2012). Even though plastic is the primary constituent of marine debris, microplastics are considered under-researched due to difficulties in assessing their distribution and abundance (Doyle et al. 2011). It has only been in recent years that international, national and regional efforts were made to quantify microplastics in the sea. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC) has highlighted concerns for environmental implications of marine litter and one of the key attributes of the MSFD is to determine the ecological harm caused by microplastics and their associated chemicals (Zarfl et al. 2011). Microplastics were first described as microscopic particles in the region of 20 Âµm diameter (Thompson et al. 2004). For the purpose of this study, microplastic refers to items <5 mm in size using the criteria developed by US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Arthur et al. 2009). The small size of microplastics makes them available for interaction with marine biota in different trophic levels. By inhabiting different marine habitats, a range of organisms are vulnerable to exposure (Wright et al. 2013a). At the millimetre and micrometre scale, sorption of microplastics is dominated by bulk portioning, with effects including blockages when fibres or fragments form aggregates."

There are several explanations as to why there is relatively high shrimp catch off the Louisiana coast, in pounds, relative to active shrimp moratorium permits issued to vessels home-ported in the state and conversely, why there is a relatively high number of active shrimp moratorium permits issued to Texas-based vessels relative to catch off of the Texas coast.

This decline, however, was transitory in nature and by 2008 the total catch in numbers of fish had again approached the eight million mark. The reasons for the precipitous decline in landings after 2004 are explored in more detail when catch of individual grouper species is considered. On average, less than 15 % of the aggregate grouper catch by recreational anglers in the Gulf in number of fish was harvested (A + B1); the remaining (approximately) 85 % was released alive (Figure 10.77, left panel). This percentage remained extremely consistent during the period of analysis (generally 83â89 % range) with the exception of the last 2 years when the percentage exceeded 90 %. The high release rate during the period reflects aggregate bag limits, minimum size restrictions, and closed seasons (Carter et al. 2008). Estimated aggregate harvest (A + B1) of grouper, expressed on a weight basis, is provided in Figure 10.77 (right panel) for the 1990â2009 period. As indicated, the annual harvest has fluctuated widely, ranging from less than three million pounds to more than eight million pounds. While some of the fluctuation can be explained by management actions (see individual species discussion), much of the variation likely simply reflects large annual recruitment variation. As a result of numerous environmental factors (most of which remain unknown), year-class size can vary by an order of magnitude and, as such, recruitment into the legal fishery (i.e., minimum legal size at harvest) can also vary substantially. Because of a high amount of pressure on the grouper stocks, a high percentage of the recreational grouper catch occurs shortly after the minimum legal size is reached. Overall, about 33 % of the aggregate reef fish harvest (A + B1), expressed on a weight basis, was represented by grouper during the period of analysis. The share of aggregate reef fish harvest in pounds represented by grouper reached a maximum of 53 % in 2000 but was only about 25 % in 2009. Grouper catch by recreational anglers consists primarily of two speciesâgag grouper and red grouperâwhich combined, account for about 95 % of the total recreational grouper harvest (A + B1) during 1990â2009. Annual harvests (A + B1) of these two species expressed on a weight basis are presented in Figure 10.78 (gag grouper, left panel; red grouper, right panel) for the 1990â2009 period. Gag grouper harvest, which accounted for about two-thirds of the total harvest of these two species, gradually increased through 2004 and declined sharply thereafter to a low of 1.5 million pounds in 2009.

The presence of epicardium on the outer face of the myocardial heart tube is confirmed. A pronounced subepicardium in the inner curvature of the looping heart tube at the site of the bulboventricular fold is confirmed, here referred to as epicardial cushion, being almost as elaborate as the adjacent endocardial atrioventricular and outflow tract cushions (Fig. 13.1a). In chicken (Fig. 13.2a, b) and mouse embryos, the presence of the (sub)epicardium is less extensive compared to the turtle. In human embryos at Carnegie stages, 11â15 (3.6â7 mm), the surface of the heart is closely covered by the epicardial epithelium, whereas the inner curvature harbours an extensive epicardial cushion (Fig. 13.1b) comparable to the turtle."
241,1147,0.417,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Some of the most profound effects of the projected salinity decline involve losses in functional diversity that would accompany the loss of marine elements in the fauna. Also, the potential increase in primary production and sedimentation of organic matter in the northern Baltic Proper, as well the climate-driven decrease in trophic efï¬ciency, as suggested for the Gulf of Bothnia, are potentially important factors for benthic communities. Human-induced pressures, such as overï¬shing and eutrophication, may erode the resilience of the Baltic Sea ecosystem, thereby making it more vulnerable to climatic variations. The Baltic Sea communities, that are poor in both species and genetic diversity, may therefore be particularly vulnerable to external forcing factors caused by the climate change.

In 2009, three of the five most commonly caught species (scaled sardine, pinfish, and Atlantic thread herring [Opisthonema oglinum]) represent species primarily used for bait (Table 10.15). Similar findings apply if one considers harvested species. Comparison of the information in Tables 10.11 and 10.15 (as well as other selected years provided in Tables 10.12, 10.13, and 10.14) suggests that, in general, the catch and harvest of many speciesâsuch as"
230,168,0.416,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"interaction with marine debris. For example, even for experts using standard protocols, it is difficult to distinguish whether wounds are caused by entanglement in active or derelict fishing gear, even when remains of nets or similar are found on the body. Some suggestions are being developed concerning entanglement rates in ghost nets or for bird entanglement in synthetic materials used for nest construction (MSFD-TSGML 2013). â¢ For ingestion, in addition to frequency of occurrence (âincidenceâ) it is recommended to collect data on quantities of ingested debris not only on the basis of numbers of items but also by mass of categories. â¢ In such ingestion records, as a minimum it is recommended to separate industrial plastics (pellets) from consumer-waste plastics (see Table 4.5). The latter if possible can be further specified following the categorisation recommended for ingestion by birds, mammals and fishes according to the EU Marine Strategy Directive (MSFDTSGML 2013), that is into categories of sheetlike, threadlike, foamed, hard fragmented, and other synthetic items, plus categories of non-plastic rubbish. â¢ For averaged data, information should be provided as âpopulation averagesâ with standard error of the mean. Population averages are calculated with the inclusion of individuals without ingested plastics. Additional data can be maximum levels observed, or proportions of animals exceeding a particular limit [such as the 0.1-g critical limit in the Ecological Quality Objective for plastic ingestion by northern fulmars (Van Franeker et al. 2011)] (see Table 4.5). We emphasize this explicit use of population averages because in quite a few of the publications checked for this review averages had been calculated just over those individuals that had plastic, often not specifying that zero values had been omitted. â¢ Negative species results (e.g. Avery-Gomm et al. 2013; Provencher et al. 2014) are also relevant but again should be based on an adequate sample size of animals studied according to a proper protocol. Thus, records of absence of debris for an individual sample should be as firm as those on presence. From experience in our own research group, we know of claims on absence or near absence of plastics in stomachs or guts of several species of which diets were studied, but without dedicated methods or data recording for marine debris (including zeros). Once proper methods were established for laboratory procedures and data recording, each of those species was found to contain debris regularly (e.g. Bravo-Rebolledo et al. 2013). â¢ Examples of protocols for ingested debris in intestinal tracts of larger organisms can be found in e.g. MSFD-TSGML (2013), with further information for ingestion by marine birds in Van Franeker et al. (2011) and marine turtles in Camedda et al. (2014). Standard protocols for marine mammals, invertebrates have not yet been established in detail but may largely follow those for seabirds and turtles. In general, these studies consider debris of â¥1 mm by using sieves with such mesh size. â¢ Only when using the above approaches on frequency of occurrence (proportion of animals in populations affected) and gravity of interaction (quantity of ingested material; damage level from entanglement), it becomes possible to design experimental or other dedicated studies that allow estimates of the true impact of plastic ingestion on wildlife populations. This relates to both the physical and chemical types of impacts, and will ultimately require model predictions using demographic characteristics of the species involved (Criddle et al. 2009)."

In such cases, AS (through the processes of primary succession) increase species richness and taxonomic diversity in a given area and increase and strengthen functional diversity and/or provide new services and goods (Bonsdorff 2006; Kotta et al. 2006). It must be emphasised that the Baltic Sea is âa sea of aliensâ (LeppÃ¤koski et al. 2002), since almost all marine organisms present today invaded the area sometime over the last 10,000 years. However, as it was mentioned previously, the invasion rate has accelerated enormously since the 1950s mainly due to human activities (such as maritime transportation and habitat change). Moreover, synergistic effects of factors such as pollution, eutrophication, overfishing and climate change stimulate new invasions (Fig. 4.2). Changes in environmental conditions and human pressure have on the one hand resulted in the elimination of highly specialised or sensitive native species from the Baltic ecosystem, while on the other hand they have generated and opened niches that have been quickly inhabited by new species. To some extent, the process of bioinvasion can be regarded as positive when species richness and taxonomic diversity are considered. For example, studies on the widespread Baltic invasive polychaete Marenzelleria spp. have shown that although this species has become dominant, it has not adversely affected deeper benthic communities, since it fills an âemptyâ niche. However, in shallow waters this has not been the case, and Marenzelleria spp. competes with the native polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor and affects the abundance of the amphipod Monoporeia affinis (DidÅ¾iulis 2006; Kotta and Olafsson 2003). Other positive consequences of alien species introduction include human benefits from both AS and IAS which has actually polarised public perceptions about bioinvasion. For example, Eriocheir sinensis (Chinese mitten crab), a famous"

231,826,0.414,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"There is evidence of recent changes in range expansion for several dolphin species in the North Sea region. One such case is the (common) bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, off the northeast coast of Scotland. Here they are at the northern limit of their distribution. The causes behind this increase in distribution are still unknown, but may be related to changes in abundance and/or distribution of prey (Wilson et al. 2004; Learmonth et al. 2006), which may also be linked to climate change. Another species reported to have exhibited recent range shifts is the white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Fig. 8.12). This is a species distributed mainly in cold temperate to Arctic waters. In the North Atlantic they are limited to high latitudes (Evans et al. 2003; MacLeod et al. 2005; Baines et al. 2006; Evans and Smeenk 2008). They are among the most abundant delphinid species in the North Sea in summer; sightings are much rarer during winter. Stranding records have shown a signiï¬cant increase of the species in the southern North Sea since the 1960s. During recent decades they have regularly been detected in the Southern Bight (Bakker and Smeenk 1987; Kinze et al. 1997; Camphuysen and Peet 2006). However, these changes need not be directly related to changes in sea temperature, but may"

The decline in number of reported grouper targeting trips coincides with the red tide event that reportedly caused high grouper mortality (Anonymous 2009). While four named hurricanes hit Florida in 2004 (Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne), these hurricanes do not appear to have materially impacted Florida fishing trips or targeted grouper trips. In fact, some have hypothesized that the increased hurricane activity was the cause for the increased grouper catch in that year. While the number of reported grouper angler targeting trips fell sharply beginning in 2005, the number of angler trips wherein grouper was caught fell for only a couple of years but increased sharply again in 2008 and 2009 (Figure 10.81, right panel). This is consistent with the increased grouper catches (A + B1 + B2) in number of fish as illustrated in Figure 10.77 (left panel). As these fish reach minimum harvest size, one might see a commensurate increase in harvest in pounds."

In general, a significant increase in the number of inland angler trips was apparent in the estimates while little increase was observed in either the number of territorial water trips or trips in the EEZ. For example, during 1990â1995, the number of angler trips in inland waters averaged 8.0 million annually. By 2005â2009, this number had increased to 14.3 million (about 75 %). During the same time frames, by comparison, angler trips in state territorial waters increased by less than 5 % (from an average of 7.4 million to an average of 7.6 million) while angler trips in federal waters increased by less than 15 % (from an annual average of 1.5 million to an annual average of 1.7 million). Furthermore, virtually all of the long-run increase in total angler trips, beginning in 2000, as discussed in the previous section of this chapter, appears to be attributable to an increase in number of trips being reported in inland waters. In 2009, total Gulf of Mexico angler trips in EEZ waters (excluding Texas) equaled 1.33 million. This total represented the lowest reported figure since the early 1990s and about a 30 % decrease from the 1.87 million trips reported as recently as 2006. Similarly, angler trips in state territorial waters have fallen sharply since 2006 with the 2009 number (6.1 million) representing more than a 40 % decline when compared to the 2006 figure of 8.8 million trips. These reductions likely reflect, in part, recessionary conditions throughout the country and among Gulf States (particularly Florida, subsequently discussed, which represents the majority of recreational Gulf fishing activities, excluding Texas). Throughout the United States, per capita personal income fell from $40,900 in 2008 to $38,800 in 2009. In Florida, the decline was from $40,000 to $37,300. While angler trips in Gulf state territorial waters and federal waters have fallen in recent years, angler trips in inland waters have increasedâ12.6 million in 2006 and 15.2 million in 2009. It is likely that given the reduction in income and high fuel prices, some anglers substituted the less expensive fishing in inland and state territorial waters for the more expensive fishing in federal waters. 10.4.2.1.3 Angler Trips by Wave The year-round temperate climate in the Gulf region is conducive to year-round fishing. The MRFSS/MRIP provides information on fishing activities (and catch) in 2-month increments: January/February, March/April, May/June, July/August, September/October, and November/December. While some seasonal fishing patterns in the Gulf are apparent, these patterns, as indicated by the information in Figure 10.46, are moderate in nature. Slightly more than 40 % of the reported trips during the 1990â2009 period occurred during the 4-month summer period ending in August while about 25 % of the angler trips occurred during the 4-month winter period ending in February (Figure 10.62, left panel). Furthermore, little change in seasonality pattern was evident when considering shorter time periods, such as the 2005â2009 period (Figure 10.62, right panel). 10.4.2.1.4 Angler Targeting Behavior There are a large number of species harvested by recreational anglers in the Gulf of Mexico. When anglers are intercepted at the conclusion of a fishing trip and asked to respond to a series of questions as part of MRFSS/MRIP, one question asked as part of the survey is species targeted on that trip. The angler is allowed to list up to two individual species. Three caveats are in order when evaluating targeting activities. First, many trips contain multiple participants and only the leader may be interviewed. It is assumed that the followers are targeting the same species. Second, the interviewees may not specify (or may not have) targeted species. Hence, targeting behavior associated with any individual species represents a minimum value of all targeting behavior. Finally, interviews occur at the completion of a trip. As such,"

Archipelagos and post-glacial land uplift are particular features of the Baltic Sea basin and so receive special consideration. This chapter comprises three main sections. The ï¬rst describes coastal zone and archipelago ecosystems in the Baltic Sea region and evaluates the potential impacts of climate change. The second examines a case study for the effect of current and future climate change on coastal bird populations and communities. The third evaluates the effects of current and future climate change on forests and natural plant communities in the Baltic Sea basin and the ways in which terrestrial ecosystems may interact with aquatic ecosystems. Climate-related changes in carbon storage are also discussed."

230,306,0.411,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"7.3 Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Abundance of Microplastics Our understanding about the distribution and the factors affecting the distribution of microplastics in the oceans is limited and much of the sampling to date has been opportunistic utilizing existing research programs (research cruises, educational programs, routine plankton monitoring) to collect material. There has also been some targeted microplastic sampling and attempts to make formal comparisons in the abundance of microplastics between locations (Browne et al. 2010, 2011). Existing data indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in surface waters, in shallow waters (Browne et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012), in deepsea sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013) and in the digestive tract of a range of organisms living within these habitats (Lusher 2015). With the exception of heavily contaminated areas such as shipbreaking yards (Reddy et al. 2006), the abundance of microplastics would appear to be relatively low in surface waters and sediments (see Lusher 2015). By volume it is apparent, however, that sediments are more contaminated than surface waters. However, because of their ubiquity, the total quantity of microplastics in the environment is considerable and in some locations represents the most numerous type of debris present (Browne et al. 2010). This ubiquity is also demonstrated by encounters when considered by marine species, of which around 10 % are with microplastics (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel GEF 2012). In terms of spatial patterns in abundance, at a global scale Browne et al. (2011) detected a weak relationship between the abundance of microplastics and human population density. Extensive sampling by Law et al. (2010) demonstrated the role of large-scale physical factors leading to increased abundance in the North Atlantic gyre far from the nearest land. She matched abundance data form the ocean surface with model predictions based on physical factors indicating that, at large scales, factors driving the abundance of debris can be used to make predictions about relative abundance (Law et al. 2010; Fig. 7.5). Formal comparisons also demonstrated patterns at smaller spatial scales with locations previously used for the dumping of sewage sludge having greater quantities of microplastic than control areas (Browne et al. 2011). In addition, intertidal sediments on shores that were downwind in relation to prevailing wind direction can have greater quantities of microplastic than those on shorelines that were up-wind (Browne et al. 2010). Targeted sampling has also indicated extremely high microplastic abundance near to a plastic processing plant in Sweden (NorÃ©n 2008). However, while the role of some potential sources including sewage and industrial spillage have been demonstrated together with the influence of physical factors leading to accumulation of debris in particular locations, our collective understanding of the relative importance of these factors in influencing spatial patterns of distribution or in making predictions about such is limited. Only a handful of studies have considered temporal patterns in the abundance of microplastics. Thompson et al. (2004) in the northeast Atlantic and Goldstein"
255,100,0.411,Railway Ecology,"Physical barrier constraints mainly affect species of small size with reduced mobility, such as herptiles. For instance, Kornilev et al. (2006) reported that eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) in the USA enter a railway at crossings with roads (where surfaces are at the same level), but then become trapped between the rails as they are unable to climb over them, and ï¬nally die due to thermal stress. A study of Hermannâs tortoises (Testudo hermanni) in Romania found that the impossibility of overtaking obstacles (e.g., ditches with angles of over 60Â°) led to an increase in the distribution of railway-kills at the end of the ditches (Iosif 2012). Bumblebees (Bombus impatiens and B. afï¬nis) in the USA (Bhattacharya et al. 2003) provide an example of a species to which the railway is a behavioral barrier. These species are reluctant to cross railways (and roads) because of their high ï¬delity to their foraging site. In experiments, individuals of these species could come back to their patches of origin after being translocated, or could leave their patch when their food was removed, but these movements were rarely in-control (non-translocated) individuals (Bhattacharya et al. 2003). Bhattacharya et al. (2003) observed that foraging bees turned back when they reached the edge of a patch (i.e., bisected by a railway); thus, rather than physically impassable barriers to bumblebees, railways acted as barriers because they are likely to be strong landmarks. On the other hand, most of the translocated gatekeeper butterflies (Pyronia tithonus) crossed the French High Speed Rail (hereinafter âHSRâ) to return to their capture plot, as this species shows a strong homing behavior (Vandevelde et al. 2012; see also Chap. 16). Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) are able to cross fenced railways in Mongolia (Ito et al. 2008), but they usually do not do so (Ito et al. 2005, 2013, and see Chap. 14). Therefore, these fenced railways represented a barrier effect affecting population dynamics as it caused disruptions in long-distance gazelle migrations (Ito et al. 2005, 2008, 2013). Stopping migration routes prevents gazelles from reaching their traditional food-rich winter quarters, potentially increasing their winter mortality due to starvation (Ito et al. 2005, 2008, 2013). This conservation problem is compounded by the current climate change, as drought events reducing vegetation productivity could require gazelles to migrate longer distances, instead of the current average of 600 km (Olson et al. 2009). To date, railways do not seem to have been a barrier for gazelle gene flow, although this assertion should be explored with more suitable markers (Okada et al. 2012; see below). Although it has been less studied, the conservation threat of the critically endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) in Kazakhstanâas a consequence of migration disruption due to fenced railwaysâseems to be similar to that of Mongolian gazelles (Olson 2013; see also Olson and van der Ree 2015). In a study carried out in Sweden, Kammonen (2015) found that a motorway and a railway running in parallel acted as barriers for two bat species (whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus and Brandtâs bat M. brandtii) in a forest-dominated area. Although this author did not differentiate between these two infrastructures, she found that bats did not directly cross them; rather they used either the green bridge or the underpass both to cross it and to forage (Kammonen 2015)."
230,436,0.41,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"noted, however, that while these studies succeeded in determining the pathways of microplastics in organisms the exposure concentrations used to achieve this goal exceeded those expected in the field, such that the results have to be treated with care. Studies of microplastic ingestion by benthic invertebrates in the field are less common than laboratory studies. Murray and Cowie (2011) identified fibres of monofilament plastics that could be sourced to fibres of trawls and fragments of plastic bags in the intestines of the commercially valuable Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). These results indicated that normal digestive processes do not eliminate some of the filaments as they cannot pass through the gastric mill system. Norway lobsters have various feeding modes, including scavenging and predation, and are not adapted to cut flexible filamentous materials (Murray and Cowie 2011). The identification of microplastics in organisms that are caught for commercial purposes and subsequently consumed whole (including guts) highlights the potential human health implications. For example, field-caught brown shrimps (Crangon crangon) (Pott 2014) and farmed and store-brought bivalves (De Witte et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014) had microplastics in their digestive system. Invertebrates could be used as indicator species for environmental contamination. Species such as Nephrops are able to integrate seasonal variation in microplastic abundance, providing an accurate measure of environmental contamination (Welden, pers. comm.). Additional studies are required to understand the flux of microplastic within benthic sediments and the interaction between different species of benthic infauna feeding in/or manipulating the sediment, such as bivalves and worms. Benthic infauna could ingest and/or excrete microplastics, the individuals or their faecal pellets may in turn be ingested by secondary consumers, thus affecting higher trophic levels."
230,421,0.41,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.3 Interactions of Microplastics with Marine Organisms Recently, Wright et al. (2013a) discussed the biological factors, which could enhance microplastic bioavailability to marine organisms: the varying density of microplastics allows them to occupy different areas of the water column and benthic sediments. As microplastics interact with plankton and sediment particles, both suspension and deposit feeders may be at risk of accidentally or selectively ingesting marine debris. However, the relative impacts are likely to vary across the size spectrum of microplastic in relation to the organisms affected, which is dependent on the size of the microplastic particles encountered. Microplastics in the upper end of the size spectrum (1â5 mm) may compromise feeding and digestion. For example, Codina-GarcÃ­a et al. (2013) isolated such pellets and fragments from the stomachs of seabirds. Particles <20 Âµm are actively ingested by small invertebrates (e.g. Thompson et al. 2004) but they are also egested (e.g. Lee et al. 2013). Studies have shown that nanoparticles can translocate (e.g. Wegner et al. 2012)"
230,572,0.409,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.1 Introduction In addition to the environmental and health issues discussed in previous book sections (Galloway 2015; KÃ¼hn et al. 2015), marine litter can cause a range of economic impacts that both increase the costs associated with marine and coastal activities, and reduce the economic benefits derived from them. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the results of research performed to date, which has attempted to quantify the economic impact of marine litter. It provides a brief analysis of the marine litter problem from an environmental economics perspective, and discusses the use and design of economic-based policy instruments to tackle the problem."
231,793,0.409,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The increased abundance of warm-temperate ï¬sh species has had a remarkable effect on species richness in the North Sea. The ICES-coordinated International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) Programme, samples more than 300 stations throughout the North Sea in the ï¬rst quarter of each year (JanuaryâMarch). Over the period 1985 to 2006, species richness increased from around 60 species to almost 90 and the increase is positively related to the increase in sea-bottom temperature (SBT) during that quarter, which rose by an average of 0.7 Â°C decadeâ1 (Fig. 8.7). The increase in species richness is consistent with both the earlier observation that rate of advance of leading edges of distributions is more rapid than the retreat of trailing edges and with the generally higher species richness of warmer areas. The apparent persistence of cool-temperate species during the Mesolithic warm period suggests that the effect is not just a transient one.

260,72,0.408,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ranavirus infections in amphibians, fish, and reptiles are widespread and affect a diverse suite of species within these vertebrate classes (Table 1, Fig. 6). The species affected include some that are economically important (e.g., rainbow trout, softshelled turtle, bullfrogs), but also several that are of conservation concern (e.g., Chinese giant salamander, gopher tortoise, dusky gopher frog, pallid sturgeon). The economic and conservation risk of these multispecies pathogens is dependent upon many factors, including characteristics of the host species. One thing is certain â some host species are highly susceptible to ranavirus, and these species are most likely to be affected during outbreaks. Thus, understanding host susceptibility to different ranaviruses is key to quantifying risk. Hostâpathogen interactions between ranaviruses and amphibians are the best characterized. Research in this area needs to continue, but there also needs to be greater attention on the role of reptiles and fish in ranavirus epizootic events."
34,1226,0.408,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Analyses of mitochondrial DNA (inherited only from the mother) variations between communities and along shore indicate clinal variations among areas (Duffield and Wells 2002), and differences in the seasonality of reproduction among sites also suggest genetic differences among communities (Urian et al. 1996). Studies by Randall S. Wells and colleagues describe the long-term structure and stability of bottlenose dolphin residents of greater Sarasota Bay, Florida, since 1970 (Irvine and Wells 1972; Scott et al. 1990; Wells 1991, 2003). By photo-identification and periodic captures for age, reproductive, and health data, presently five generations have been tracked in the area, including several first seen in the 1970s that are still living. Estimated immigration and emigration rates are about 2â3 % (Wells and Scott 1990). However, while it is rather stable and almost all individuals remain, this is not a wholly isolated, genetically closed population, and at least some calves were sired by nonresidents (Duffield and Wells 2002). While yearround residents occur in other areas as well, at least some animals can move quite long distances, as nearshore animals have been identified up to several 100 km away in Texas waters (Lynn and Wâ¬ ursig 2002). There is some aspect of seasonality as well. In smaller bays such as Sarasota, Florida, and San Luis Pass, Texas, some residents move into Gulf coastal waters during fall and winter and return inshore in spring and summer (Irvine et al. 1981; Maze and ursig 1999, respectively). In larger bays, there may be even more seasonal migrations, as there is a tendency for greater numbers in northerly bays in summer and southerly bays in winter (e.g., Tampa Bay, Florida, Scott et al. 1989; and Galveston Bay, Texas, BraÌger et al. 1994). The above data must not obscure the fact that most bottlenose dolphin populations or communities of the Gulf are not thoroughly described, and much more information is needed for proper identifications and numbers. Only four populations are sufficiently well known with data from the past 8 years or less for reliable numbers estimates: Sarasota Bay (160 animals, direct count), Choctawhatchee Bay (179 animals, best estimate), Apalachicola Bay (537 animals, best estimate), and St. Joseph Bay (146 animals, best estimate). In total, an estimated 5,355 inshore/nearshore bottlenose dolphins reside in the U.S. waters of the Gulf in 28â32 bays and"
