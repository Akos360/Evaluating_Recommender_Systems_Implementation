241,696,0.618,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Most regional climate change information from global models in the last few years originates from the CMIP3 project underlying the IPCC fourth assessment (IPCC 2007). In that project, about 20 different coupled atmosphereâocean general circulation models (AOGCM) were used in a number of different experiments including simulations of the twentieth century with observed forcing and a number of SRES scenarios for the twenty-ï¬rst century. In addition to GCM and scenario uncertainty, uncertainty due to natural variability was also considered in CMIP3. This was achieved by multiple simulations with individual GCMs that differed only in terms of their initial conditions. Extensive"

365,478,0.599,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The high resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) COSMO-CLM at about 8 km2 of resolution (Rockel et al. 2008) was applied to simulate climate trends from 1971 to 2065 under A1B emission scenario and using the boundary conditions of the General Circulation Model (GCM) CMCC-MED (about 80 km of horizontal resolution, Scoccimarro et al. 2011). According to the validation with observed climate along the historical period, the RCM was bias-corrected for the whole simulated period (Cervigni et al. 2013 â Chap. 4 and Appendix B). To take into account the uncertainty on future climate outcomes nine GCMs simulations taking part of the CMIP3 experiment plus those from the CMCC-MED GCM, were used to âperturbâ the RCM results along the period 2006â2065 and maintain high resolution. The GCMs chosen for the simulations were thus: HadCM3, CGCM_2.3.2, CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, CCSM3, MIROC3.2, GFDL_cm2.1, ECHAM5, FGOALS, and CMCC-MED. The approach to perturb RCM outputs using the variability of global simulations (Buishand and Lenderink 2004) was applied to temperature and precipitation fields (Cervigni et al. 2013 â Chap. 4 and Appendix B). Such climate simulation ensemble was used to drive the impact assessment described herein comparing impact model outcomes in the short and medium term periods (2006â2035 and 2036â2065, respectively), with the historical baseline (1976â2005). According to the multiple components of the analysis, and their dependence on climate variables suffering from different uncertainty degree in the future (e.g. higher for precipitations than for temperature), the full range of models"

For example, models generally have problems with sub-grid precipitation, simulating precipitation more often, but in lower amounts, than reality. As precipitation scavenging is a complex and nonlinear process (e.g. Barrie 1992) such issues will cause errors in modelled wet deposition that are difï¬cult to evaluate. There are also many uncertainties inherent in the deposition monitoring methods themselves (Draaijers and Erisman 1993; Erisman et al. 2005). Large differences between models were found in the global models participating in the COSAM study, in which the wet deposition efï¬ciency varied by a factor of four (Roelofs et al. 2001). A similar spread was also found for global models by Dentener et al. (2006) and Textor et al. (2006). At the European scale, the EMEP MSC-W model (Simpson et al. 2012) has been subject to extensive evaluation against observed wet deposition estimates. Standard scatter plots showing model performance against observed concentrations of NO3â and NH4+ are available in the annual EMEP status reports (e.g. Fagerli and Hjellbrekke 2008; Berge and Hjellbrekke 2010).

320,76,0.53,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"and variability of common parameters, but also in their extreme values. Central Europe is located in a climatic transition zone of precipitation increase and decrease. Estimating the changes is difficult. This fact results in a high uncertainty in the expected future change. These uncertainties from observations and similarly from models need to be taken into account in all fields of climate change related decisions. Climate researcher can give a hint of possible future changes but also have to communicate the range of uncertainty and the limitation of measures. The challenge in climate research tends to focus more and more to a very local scale. In all fields of applications strategies have to be developed that take a wide range of possible future developments into account and are adapted regularly by updated climate data. Acknowledgements The analysis of the climate change signal in Central and Eastern Europe is based on regional climate model simulations for all of Europe, and the A1B emissions scenario is based on regional climate model simulations carried out in the European Union-funded Project ENSEMBLES (GOCE-CT-2003-505539).

214,429,0.528,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"11.3.2 Uncertain Predictions: Where to Be Cautious Precipitation is a classic case where some aspects of the impacts of climate change are well known, and some are much more uncertain. As noted briefly in Chap. 10, as the spatial scale of interest decreases, the large-scale constraints fall away, and potential model structural errors start to become larger.9 While models agree on the sign and even some of the magnitude of global trends, they do not agree on the magnitude (even the magnitude of global changes), and particularly on what happens in different regions. These projections are less certain, or âas likely as notâ in IPCC language from Table 11.1. For temperature and precipitation, the broad regional patterns (wetter tropics, drier subtropics, warming high latitudes) are known, but the details of those patterns are highly uncertain, as is clear from Figs. 11.4 and 11.5. âBroad scaleâ means relying on the global energy budget, and global trends are fairly certain, but other classes of results are less certain. In particular, the magnitude of many of these changes is not well known. While most models predict that the polar regions will warm faster than the rest of the planet (Fig. 11.4), the magnitude and speed of the warming is not well constrained. In addition, along with such warming as we have already seen in the Arctic has come a dramatic reduction in the sea-ice coverage (area).10 This is illustrated in Fig. 11.6a from models. The region in gray is the spread of model simulations of the historical period. Models are pretty good at following the observed decline of the Arctic sea-ice extent, but they do not fully capture the magnitude (steepness) of the trend. Here is a case where projections indicate that in September the Arctic will likely be mostly free of ice by some date in the 21st century; it is mostly a question of when. But that is not to say the models are doing that well. If we look in the Antarctic sea ice (Fig. 11.6b), which is generally more stable than the Arctic sea ice, models are predicting slight declines over the past 30 years, whereas the observations indicate increases in the extent of late summer sea ice. The spread of models is also very large. So while models seem to represent the Arctic well, it is not clear that they represent the Antarctic well. The reasons are complex and likely have to do"
241,676,0.526,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The GCMs were not designed for direct application in impact models. Prudhomme et al. (2002) stated that the quality of their output did not allow for direct use in hydrological impact studies, because the spatial and temporal scales were too coarse. Wilby et al. (1999) recommended the use of downscaling techniques before the GCM output data could be used in impact studies. There are many possibilities for downscaling GCM output: direct use of RCM output (Wood et al. 2004), use of bias-corrected RCM output (Wood et al. 2004; Fowler et al. 2007a), statistical downscaling (Wilby et al. 2000; MÃ¼ller-Wohlfeil et al. 2000), stochastic weather generators (Evans and Schreider 2002) or weather typologies, and/or indices (Pilling and Jones 2002). The skills of different downscaling methods differ considerably between variables and regions. Hydrologic simulation was found to be sensitive to biases in the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation at the monthly level, especially where the seasonal snow pack transfers run-off from one season to the next (Fowler et al. 2007c). Using the example of the Lule River in northern Sweden and two GCMs used to force the same RCM, Graham et al. (2007a) have shown that the choice of driving GCM has a greater impact on results than the choice of GHG emission scenario. The strong impact of the choice of GCM was also emphasised by Widmann et al. (2003), Jasper et al. (2004), SalathÃ© (2005), and Wilby et al. (2006). Fowler et al. (2007a) stated that at least two variablesâ temperature and precipitationâhad to be downscaled for impact studies in hydrology. In impact models, the physical consistency between variables is very important. To obey this requirement for physical consistency, multi-variate methods should be applied which yield simultaneous correction of relevant variables. This is possible when RCMs are used (Fowler and Kilsby 2007; Fowler et al. 2007a; Graham et al. 2007a, b), but is generally not in statistical downscaling. A multi-site approach should be used when spatial consistency is needed."
241,623,0.524,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The biggest disadvantage of the RCM methodology is probably the occurrence of systematic biases in the present climate simulations. These systematic biases, also seen in GCMs, are because dynamic climate simulations carried out with GCMs and RCMs are bound only to changing atmospheric GHG concentrations. Due to their coarse resolution and parameterisations, GCMs and RCMs are not perfect; so even the mean climatological values produced by these models deviate from the corresponding observations. In RCM climate projections, the systematic biases are nonlinear combinations of the systematic errors of the driving GCM and the systematic errors of the RCM itself. Another limitation is that there is still the need to downscale area averages given as grid values in model output to point values necessary for impact studies (Xu et al. 2005). Given the discrepancies between observations and model results for present-day climate, a method is needed to cope with the biases. Given that good observation data sets exist, more realistic data sets of forcing ï¬elds incorporating the projected changes can be created and used for impact studies (Piani et al. 2010). This can be achieved through the methods known as MOS. These are statistical models linking simulated variables to observations. There are generally two groups of MOS methods: one is known as the bias correction method (DÃ©quÃ© et al. 2007; Piani et al. 2010), while the other is known as the perturbation of observed data (POD) or the delta change (DC) method (Hay et al. 2000; Lenderink et al. 2007a; van Roosmalen et al. 2011). A review of MOS methods was reported by Maraun et al. (2010)."
222,329,0.523,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"temperature, based upon the A1B emissions scenario, is projected to increase by between 1.5 Â°C and 2.7 Â°C, and by the 2090s it is in the range of 2.6â4.8 Â°C. There is also a consistent signal, using this particular climate model, towards increasing annual rainfall by the end of the twenty-first century (Fig. 11.2). The range of projections for the 2080s is between +8 per cent and +28 per cent relative to 1981â2000. However, it should be noted that year to year variability is large. By 2050 the range is between â1.4 per cent and around +13 per cent compared to present day. The projections also show a decrease in light to moderate rainfall events, a slight increase in heavy events and a large increase in very heavy events (Caesar et al. 2015). So, despite a decrease in the overall number of days with rainfall, the intensity on the days when rainfall occurs is projected to increase. This could result in flooding and have an impact upon the availability of fresh water during the agricultural calendar. From the total of 17 RCM simulations, three were selected for application within the other biophysical models (Table 11.1, Figs. 11.4 and 11.5). One was chosen based upon the model variant that represents the âstandardâ model parameter configuration (known as Q0). Two additional simulations were chosen for their ability to span a wide range of uncertainty across the full collection of 17 model simulations. The first of these, Q8 indicates warmer but drier conditions compared to the present day in the 2060s, but warmer and wetter by 2090. The other simulation (Q16) projects the largest temperature increase by both 2050 and 2090, and also large precipitation increases at both 2050 and 2090.

All categories (precipitation, clouds, etc.) were taken directly from the table of contents in the BACC report so as to maintain consistency between the evaluation and the report itself. As Fig. A2.2 indicates, there is very little discrepancy among those aware of the BACC report as to the question of whether the report tended to underestimate or overestimate the possible magnitude of future climatic change. If anything, the scientists tended towards the claim that a number of climate change phenomena are slightly underestimated in the report. Only for surface air temperature and coastal erosion were there claims of slight overestimation. Overall, it could be concluded that there is considerable agreement among the survey participants that the BACC report reflects the claims of the broader scientiï¬c community."
214,395,0.505,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"But broadly, there is the interesting property that the wisdom of crowds applies. If the models have random mistakes and their biases are uncorrelated, then the average of the models (the multi-model mean) tends to be better than most of the models. This is a big âif,â and many models have dependencies, but in practice (and in synthetic statistical tests), because the climate system is complicated, and most models meet basic measures of representing the system (conservation of energy and mass), the multi-model mean is usually a pretty good statistic. This makes ensembles quite valuable. One thing to remember is that there is lots of chaotic internal variability in the climate system, and the observed record is only one possible realization of that internal variability. There may or may not be an El NiÃ±o event this year, but the possibility is that there could have been. So with the real climate system, we have only one ensemble. We expect models to be different from observations in any given year, or even decade, if they are fully coupled and internally consistent. This also confounds prediction and evaluation. It is one reason why the present and the past do not fully constrain the future (see box). Why the Present and Past DO NOT Constrain the Future It is often assumed that a model must be able to represent the present (or past climate) correctly to represent the future. This is true. However, while necessary, it is not a sufï¬cient condition to constrain the future. Suppose that a model represents the present for the wrong reasons. Perhaps there is a large compensation of errors: Maybe an error in the radiation code letting in too much energy is compensated for by an error in the sea-ice model that reflects too much energy. If the planet warms up, the sea ice will go away, but the error in the radiation code will remain. It is also assumed that the more accurate a model is at representing the present (or the past), the better it will be at representing the future. This is also true, but it requires that âbetterâ representations be for those areas that matter for future climate, and this is not necessarily the case. What does that mean in practice? Letâs say you have two measures of model performance. One is based on clouds, and one is based on temperature. If model A scores 80 % on both temperature and clouds relative to observations, and model B scores 100 % on clouds but 20 % on temperature, then a simple average score says that model A scores 80 % and model B scores 60 %. But if present clouds are more important for future climate than temperature, model B may be better. In the previous example, the present-day model may score well on sea ice and lower on the radiation code, but the radiation code is more important for the future. Also, knowing the mean state today does not imply that you can predict the change in that state accurately in the future. It is usually a good indicator, but not guaranteed. That covers why the present does not necessarily constrain the future. Because with present climate we do not know what the response to a forcing (i.e., feedbacks) will be. But what about using the past: If we know"

241,657,0.492,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"et al. 2007). For instance, in winter, model results tend to be too wet in northern Europe, too warm in summer and winter, and too cold in spring and autumn (Jacob et al. 2007). On the one hand, RCMs generally overestimate the number of wet days; this âdrizzle effectâ is partly because RCMs simulate area averages rather than point values. While on the other, RCMs underestimate heavy precipitation events (e.g. Fowler et al. 2007b). Generally, bias is different in different part of the distribution (e.g. Jeong et al. 2011; Fig. 10.6). A major advantage of RCMs is the simulation of spatially coherent ï¬elds. In general, RCMs with a typical resolution of 25 km overestimate the spatial coherence of precipitation events, in particular for convective precipitation. It should be noted that RCMs provide meaningful information only on the scale of a few grid cells (e.g. Fowler and EkstrÃ¶m 2009). In particular, local precipitation is dominated by internal climate variability (Maraun 2012). As RCMs integrate the equations governing the atmospheric circulation, they in principle provide a coherent picture. However, biases in one variable may propagate into strong biases in dependant variables (e.g. Fig. 10.7); for example, Yang et al. (2010) have shown for Sweden that small temperature biases may, via the nonlinear interaction with precipitation around the melting point, lead to large biases in spring river run-off. Inconsistencies arise in particular where parameterisations come into play. For example, Graham et al. (2007b) have shown for the drainage areas"

222,392,0.483,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"In order to run a set of hydrological simulations and climate scenarios, INCA requires a daily time series of climate data, namely, precipitation, hydrologically effective rainfall (HER), temperature, and soil moisture deficit (SMD). The model uses these data to drive the hydrological components of the model which generate the sub-catchment river flows. However, obtaining meteorological data over such a large catchment scale is difficult, especially given the wide spatial differences in topography, altitude, and land use in India, China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Observational data are available from in-situ weather stations and also from satellite measurements, and these have been integrated into observational datasets which cover the region as part of the Aphrodite online data system.1 These data have been used to calibrate the climate models both in space and time. The large-scale general circulation models (GCMs) have been used to simulate climate across the region and to assess the impacts of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on the global climate system. However, GCMs typically have coarse spatial resolutions with horizontal grid boxes of a few hundred kilometres size and cannot provide the high-resolution climate information that is required for climate impact and adaptation studies. The use of regional climate models (RCMs), which dynamically downscale the GCM simulations through being driven using boundary conditions from GCMs, can provide higher resolution grids (typically 50 km or finer) and are better able to represent features such as local topography and coast lines and their effects on the regional climate, in particular precipitation. There have been relatively few studies focused upon the Ganges river linked to the Bangladesh region which have used RCM output. In this research, an existing set of GCM simulations were used to provide boundary conditions for a RCM for the period 1971â2099 over a South Asia domain, as described in Chap. 11 and Caesar et al. (2015). The GCM is the third climate configuration of the Met Office Unified Model (HadCM3) and is run as a 17-member perturbed physics ensemble"

241,742,0.482,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"11.10 Conclusion Several numerical climate change simulations have been undertaken since the ï¬rst BACC assessment (BACC Author Team 2008). Models now operate at higher horizontal resolution. Furthermore, the simulations cover a larger degree of the uncertainty range including: a wider range of emission scenarios (sampling the uncertainty in forcing), more climate models (addressing model uncertainty) and ensemble members (addressing natural variability). The picture emerging from these simulations conï¬rms the ï¬ndings of previous studies (e.g. BACC Author Team 2008) in terms of climate change in the Baltic Sea region. Climate model studies suggest that â¢ The future climate will get warmer, especially in winter. Changes increase with time and/or rising emissions of GHGs. There is a large spread between the different models, but they all project warming. â¢ Cold extremes in winter and warm extremes in summer are expected to change more than the average conditions, implying a narrower (broader) temperature distribution in winter (summer). â¢ Future precipitation will be higher than today. The increase is projected to be greatest in winter. In summer, models project an increase in the far north and a decrease in the south. For the transition zone between these two regions, the sign of change is uncertain. â¢ Precipitation extremes are expected to increase although with a higher degree of uncertainty compared to the projected change in temperature extremes. â¢ Future changes in wind speed are highly dependent on changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation simulated by the GCMs. The results diverge and it is not possible to estimate whether there will be a general increase or decrease in wind speed in the future. A common feature of many model simulations, however, is an increase in wind speed over oceans that are ice-covered in the present climate but not in the future. Future changes in extreme wind speed are uncertain. â¢ The increased number of high-resolution regional model studies driven by many different GCMs has enabled a tighter connection with hydrological models, even though various forms of bias correction are necessary as an interface between the two types of model. Furthermore, the large number of available simulations enables some estimation of uncertainty of impacts. â¢ Statistical downscaling studies using atmospheric predictors have addressed several predictands, with the greatest emphasis given to hydrological variables. The ï¬ndings of detailed studies have been in line with those from studies employing dynamical downscaling."
241,753,0.482,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"model WSFS with the two-dimensional hydraulic model TUFLOW. Future scenarios using three different emission scenarios and two different GCMs were applied. Additionally, two GCM projections were downscaled using the RCA3 RCM. The period 2070â2099 was considered, and the delta change approach was applied for bias correction. Based on annual maximum discharges projected by WSFS, floods with return periods of 2 years and 250 years were estimated using an extreme value-type I distribution. The floods were used as input to the hydraulic model. For all eight scenarios, the flood with a return period of 2 years was found to decrease in a future climate, while for the 250-year flood a decrease was found in seven out of eight cases. The reason for decreasing flood discharges was found to be a decline in snowfall together with a shorter snow accumulation period and warm spells with snow melt during winter. As a result, future erosion power was reduced, that is diminishing flow velocity, bed shear stress and stream power. Veijalainen et al. (2010b) used the same methodology as Lotsari et al. (2010) to assess the impacts of climate change on flooding in Finland. However, the number of climate change projections was increased to 20, including three emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B1), ï¬ve GCMs and four RCMs. The delta change approach was used for transferring the climate model results to the hydrological model. Changes in flooding were evaluated at 67 study sites covering Finland. The 100-year floods were on average found to decrease by 8â22 % in 2070â2099 compared to the reference period 1971â2000. However, considerable variation between regions was observed. In areas currently dominated by spring snowmelt floods, the 100-year flood generally decreased due to less snow accumulation. In areas where autumn and winter flooding currently occur frequently, the projected increases in temperature and precipitation result in increasing floods. For the central lakes characterised by long-lasting volume floods, a clear increase was found. The changes in discharge were not linearly reflected in flood area extent. The characteristics of the river channels and floodplains were found to greatly influence the spatial extent of flood inundation. Flat floodplains showed a larger change in inundation than the projected change in discharge, whereas floodplains with greater variation in topography experienced less change in inundation. Generalisations based on a few case studies or a few climate scenarios in countries with variable hydrological conditions should be avoided, however.

Given uncertainty in climate model parameter values, 17 different combinations of parameter values were used to identify ranges in possible temperature and precipitation changes (see Chap. 11, Fig. 11.3). Despite substantial variability between the 17 iterations, all projections indicate a warmer and wetter climate by 2099. From these 17 scenarios, three were selected for application in the models to cover a range of possible change (Q0, Q8 and Q16). Ensemble members were selected to provide a central baseline (Q0), a warmer and drier scenario during the mid-century (Q8), and a much warmer and wetter scenario for both 2050 and 2099 (Q16). Sea-level rise is also a critical issue for Bangladesh. Global sea-level rise scenarios are based directly on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Church et al. 2013).

The effects of precipitation are not presented here because the scenarios do not alter the level of precipitation. Exposure to temperatures above 30 Â°C appear detrimental to maize yields. The response function reflects the fact that years with higher exposure to high temperature tend to be associated with lower than average maize yields in the study region. This is in line with previous findings in the literature. The lower part of the Fig. 3 represents the baseline temperature distribution across temperature bins. This is somewhat similar to the distribution within bins illustrated in Fig. 2. Again, for the baseline climate, exposure beyond 30 Â°C is not very common. However, a uniform warming scenario shifts the temperature distribution to the right, which increases the frequency of high temperatures. The anticipated consequence is that maize yields would decrease as exposure to detrimental temperature levels rises."
241,812,0.466,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Glacier inventories are incomplete, but there are an estimated 300,000â400,000 glaciers and small ice caps in the world (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Detailed observations of these glaciers are sparse, and this leads to substantial uncertainty in their present-day volume and present-day rates of mass loss. The uncertainty in total volume (Grinsted 2013) will propagate to the projections of the contribution from mountain glaciers and ice caps (Slangen and van de Wal 2011). Some projections of the glacier contribution to global sea-level rise are based on a semi-empirical approach, where mass loss is related to global temperature change (e.g. Meehl et al. 2007).

214,283,0.463,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"GCMs and regional climate models are dynamical models. They use the equations of motion and thermodynamics to determine the rates of change of physical quantities (e.g., water vapor, temperature or heat, cloud water, carbon). There are also statistical models of climate. Statistical models of climate take observations from the past and try to predict the future with various forms of regression or correlation analysis: ï¬tting past data on temperature and precipitation for example, to a function that is used as a predictor of the future. Usually this is done for downscaling, ï¬tting temperature at one point to a larger scale temperature or flow pattern that can be predicted by a dynamical model. Regional Climate Modeling: Downscaling Use of a regional model at high resolution is an example of at type of analysis called downscaling.3 Downscaling uses ï¬ner-resolution information to improve the results of a coarse-scale model. It is effective especially when the improvement in resolution affects the simulation because of small-scale features at the surface: as is the case in regions of varied topography (mountains or coastlines). Use of a regional or local area model is known as dynamical downscaling. Downscaling can also be statistical downscaling. For example, if you want to know the temperature high on a mountain, you could develop a statistical relationship between the temperature for the whole region and this particular point based on observations over the past 50 years, and then adjust climate model output for the region in the same way to get a simulated record at that station that takes into account the unique local features (high altitude). Both methods of downscaling would be particularly useful for representing climate in regions of variable topography: either at high altitude, Wilby, R. L., Wigley, T. M. L., Conway, D., Jones, P. D., Hewitson, B. C., Main, J., & Wilks, D. S. (1998). âStatistical Downscaling of General Circulation Model Output: A Comparison of Methods.â Water Resources Research, 34(11): 2995â3008."

They found that RCMs tend to produce a reasonable annual cycle of temperature but clearly overestimate precipitation in winter and underestimate precipitation in summer. By applying their bias correction method to daily precipitation, they were able to bring the model results much closer to observations. The same correction function would then be applied to the output of scenario simulations, under the assumption that the causes that produce the mean biases in the models remain unchanged under a future climate. The corrected values of precipitation and temperature were used by ApsÄ«te et al. (2010) to drive a hydrological model to estimate changes in run-off in the eastern Baltic Sea catchment area. Future run-off will be modulated by changes in two factors. On the one hand, evaporation will tend to increase due to higher air temperatures, while on the other, precipitation is expected to increase, as simulated by most RCMs participating in the PRUDENCE project (Christensen and Christensen 2007). A surprising result of the study by ApsÄ«te et al. (2010) was that the ï¬rst factor seemed to be more important in the future, and river run-off would tend to decrease according to the RCM simulations analysed. Also, important is that the annual cycle of run-off tended to change considerably, with the late spring maximum observed in the present climate shifting to earlier seasons even into the months of January and February. This is a consequence of the rising temperatures and an earlier onset of the melt season, as well as changes in the annual cycle of precipitation and increased evaporation. This represents a major shift in the annual run-off cycle that may have profound consequences on many economic sectors should it remain unmanaged by reservoirs. However, the study by ApsÄ«te et al. (2010) is based on the mean of data simulated by 21 models and does not indicate the spread of individual simulations. Previous projections of river run-off into the Baltic Sea indicated that the uncertainty was large enough to encompass a broad range of projections, from slight reductions to substantial increase (Graham 2004). In a further study aimed at reconstructing run-off in the past 500 years, Hansson et al. (2011) also applied a statistical downscaling method using predictors from climate reconstructions of atmospheric circulation and temperature. Although the study is not focused on future projections but rather on past evolution of run-off, their ï¬ndings about past variability in river run-off were also interpreted in the context of future climate change. Hansson et al. (2011) briefly indicated that if their statistical downscaling model is correct, run-off would tend to increase in the northern Baltic Sea and decrease in the southern Baltic Sea. This result is mainly driven by the signal of increasing temperature in the northern Baltic Sea catchment area and by a decrease in precipitation in Central Europe. Chap. 12 deals explicitly with run-off projections."

Models that are good for one purpose may not be good for other purposes. Understanding the uncertainty and, hence, the utility of a modelâany model, but especially climate modelsârequires extensive testing against observations. Evaluation of climate models requires some fundamental understanding of the observations themselves. What is the uncertainty and accuracy in the observations? As we discuss in detail in Chap. 10, knowing the uncertainty in our observations is an important part of being able to evaluate the uncertainty in models. Evaluating climate models is done in many ways but is often done similar to weather models. Models are evaluated on their representation of past events, either a single event or a statistical series of events. Evaluation of climate models can also show where critical processes need to be better understood to constrain climate model projections. For example, since cloud processes and responses to environmental changes are uncertain, better representation and evaluation of clouds in climate models is critical."
241,669,0.447,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"As RCMs can resolve mesoscale atmospheric features explicitly, they do add small-scale structures to the largescale circulation provided by the driving model (Feser 2006). This explicit treatment of small-scale atmospheric features leads, for many variables, to an AV with respect to the driving model. This is particularly the case for the simulation of precipitation, which also depends strongly on topography and landâsea contrast, which are better represented at the increased resolution of the RCM. Consequently, the simulated mean precipitation patterns as well as the extreme values are enhanced, especially for complex terrain (e.g. Christensen and Christensen 2001; Feldmann et al. 2008; Suklitsch et al. 2008). For the Baltic Sea region, Walther et al. (2013) demonstrated the improved simulation of the daily precipitation cycle for spring and summer with increasing RCM resolution; an example for a station in central southern Sweden is displayed in Fig. 10.10. Winterfeldt et al. (2011) analysed AV in dynamically downscaled wind speed ï¬elds. They used the Brier skill score (BSS) to detect the AV of the regionally modelled (with spectrally nudged-REMO) wind in comparison with the global reanalysis (NCEP). As seen in Fig. 10.11, the RCM provides AV along the coasts and in narrow bays and straits, in places with complex coastlines or topography. Over open seas and oceans, as well as the interior of Baltic Sea, the BSS is negative, indicating that in these regions, dynamical downscaling does not add value. Feser (2006) analysed AV in the case of SLP and 2 m air temperature provided by the REMO RCM in comparison with NCEP reanalysis data. Spatial ï¬lters were used to separate the data into two domains: that represented best at the large-scale and that represented well by the REMO model (Fig. 10.12). The effect of spectral nudging was also analysed. For SLP, no AV is provided by RCM simulation without nudging. The small improvement was obtained when spectral nudging was applied.

Results are aggregated across AEZs, to develop impacts at the level of individual crops, and across crops, to produce results at the level of AEZs, using baseyear information on production shares and value added to define weights used for aggregating. Only the results based in a fixed CO2 concentration are reported here. The full set of results, including increases in CO2 atmosphere concentration, is reported in Cervigni et al. (2013).

The EMEP model has a tendency to underestimate wet deposition in Nordic sites. For oxidised nitrogen (Fig. 15.16b), ï¬ve sites stand out as having much higher measured wet deposition than modelled. The reason for this seems to be that the observed precipitation at the sites far exceeds the modelled precipitation (by a factor of two for the Norwegian site).

365,627,0.443,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Three climate change scenarios are considered in these simulations. These include a âNo Climate Changeâ scenario under which weather conditions remain at baseline, that is as observed in the 2009â2010 rainy season, a âMid-line Climate Changeâ scenario under which mean temperature, standard deviation of temperature and standard deviation of rainfall are all increased by 10% from baseline, and a âHigh Climate Changeâ scenario under which the levels of these three weather variables are increased by 20% from baseline. Due to the uncertainty of the effects of climate change on rainfall levels in Malawi, we do not simulate changes in mean rainfall as part of our climate change scenarios.11 Observed price levels in the 2009â2010 data are used for both inputs and outputs under all three climate change scenarios, thus the general equilibrium effects of climate change on market prices are not considered by this analysis.12"
320,98,0.443,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"There is convincing evidence that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing a substantial rise in global temperature (IPCC 2007). As integral component of the climate system, water is the primary medium through which climate change exhibits its impacts on earthâs ecosystem. Increases in temperature enhance the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere and thus, lead to an intensification of the hydrological cycle. The hydrological impacts of climate change to the individual protected areas are area-specific and vary from region to region. Generally, key changes in the hydrological system for Central Europe include alterations in the seasonal distribution, magnitude and duration of precipitation, an increase in evapotranspiration in areas where water is available and a reduction of the snow season. This leads to variations in water storage and water fluxes at the land surface as well as in soil moisture and seasonal snow packs. Observations of central European glaciers, which are considered as key indicator for the early detection of climate change, show a severe mass loss in the last decades. Other indirect impacts of climate change include modifications in the intra- and interannual variability of river flows and an increase in the risk of flood and droughts. Through, water resources management can help to counterbalance effects of climate change on stream flow and water availability until a certain level. In general, climate-induced changes are projected to aggravate the impact of other stresses like land-use and socio-economic changes on water availability (EEA 2008).

365,819,0.442,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Higher frequency of climatic shocks can provide with more incentives for adaptation. Significance of these variables would also corroborate the intuition that unless Governments encourage farmers for ex ante adaptation most of adaptation to climate change could be ex post. It is believed that many impacts of climate change would be felt along the agro-ecological zones, hence the estimation includes indicators for agro-ecological zones. Higher long-term climate variability (30 years, 1980â2010) in terms of more variable temperature and precipitation could necessitate a more adaptive behavior. Finally, the estimation also takes into account long-term average precipitation and temperature (30 years, 1980â2010). The climate variables have been compiled for about 400 weather stations across Central Asia. The data come from national meteorological agencies, Williams and Konovalov (2008), NASAâs Global Summary of the Day, and other sources. Climate variables from individual weather stations were spatially projected to the digital map of Central Asia using spatial interpolation technique of inverse weighted distance. Following this, corresponding weather variables were extracted for each household using the GPS location of the household."

241,752,0.439,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Design floods are hypothetical floods deï¬ned by their probability of occurrence and are used for planning and floodplain management. A 14-day design precipitation with a 1000-year return period was generated for both present-day and future climate conditions. The design precipitation, which depends on location and time of year, is deï¬ned such that the largest precipitation occurs on the 9th day of the period and corresponds to the 1000-year maximum of 1-day precipitation, while the precipitation sum of days 7â11 corresponds to the 1000-year maximum 5-day precipitation. The design storm is moved through the 40-year observation period and the 30-year future period. Results representing 2071â2100 from three GCMs, three emission scenarios and two estimates of design precipitation were applied in order to evaluate the uncertainty of the resulting change in design flood. The rainfall-run-off model WSFS was used. In northern Finland, the timing and magnitude of the floods were on average found to remain unchanged. Warmer winters with less snow accumulation were partly compensated for by increases in winter and spring precipitation. On dams in western and central Finland, the design floods increased, while the timing remained unchanged (summer and autumn). In eastern Finland, the time of the design floods changed from spring to summer, while both increasing and decreasing magnitudes of the design floods were found. The range of changes in the simulated design floods was large at most sites resulting in projections of both increasing and decreasing design floods at several dams. However, the relative contribution from the individual uncertainty sources was not quantiï¬ed. The authors drew attention to the fact that additional uncertainty sources such as the impact model type or the parameters of the impact model would result in even larger uncertainty ranges. Veijalainen et al. (2010a) assessed the impact of climate change on the regulation of three lakes in eastern Finland. The rainfall-run-off model WSFS was forced by results from 14 projections of climate change generated by combining four GCMs, where one was found as an average of 19 GCMs (IPCC 2007) and three SRES scenarios. Two scenarios were downscaled using the RCA3 RCM. The delta change approach was used for bias correction in all cases. Clear changes occurred in the seasonality of run-off and water levels, with decreases in late spring and summer and increases in late autumn and winter. The changes were primarily due to changes in snow accumulation and melt with changes in precipitation and evaporation less important. Current regulation permits were found to be unsuited for the projected future hydrological conditions in many lakes. The effects of climate change on discharge and fluvial erosion potential were studied by Lotsari et al. (2010) for a sub-Arctic catchment in the border area between Finland and Norway in northern Fennoscandia. Impact modelling was carried out by combining results from the rainfall-run-off"
214,441,0.439,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"11.4.1 Tropical Cyclones Tropical cyclones are an important and relatively small-scale atmospheric phenomena. A climate model at low resolution will not adequately represent tropical cyclones, but it will typically have weak versions of them: warm-core cyclonic systems in the tropics that propagate like tropical cyclones but with very low wind speeds. These can be estimated, and how these âpseudo stormsâ change in the future can be used as a guide. Or the âpotentialâ for storms can be derived. For tropical cyclones, this is often based on an index derived from present conditions that predict average storm intensity from the large-scale moisture and wind ï¬elds. These indexes of âpotential stormsâ or âpotential intensityâ can be estimated in climate models now and in the future. This is one example of downscaling discussed in Chap. 5: using large-scale output to represent what ï¬ne-scale structures should be present. The danger with a lot of these proxy or downscaling methods is the danger of overï¬tting to the present day: If a measure of tropical cyclones is based on sea surface temperatures of the tropical oceans, and the current maximum is 82 Â°F (28 Â° C), how will this work if the maximum rises to 84 Â°F (29 Â°C)? We are out of the range of observations. There is no guarantee that the proxy based on sea surface temperatures will represent the same variability in cyclones now or in the future if we are forced to extrapolate a statistical model to future conditions that have not been experienced in the past."
320,87,0.438,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,By the use of the Climatic Water Balance (CWB) expected changes on the potential water availability due to climate change can be illustrated. The CWB is defined as the amount of precipitation minus the potential evapotranspiration. It indicates the extent of the water yield in an area and provides an indication for the vegetation on-site. If the potential evapotranspiration is higher than the amount of precipitation the CWB turns out to be negative and there is a climatic water deficit. A positive water balance indicates a climatic water surplus for the area. For the results shown in Fig. 3.2 the potential evapotranspiration is calculated with the TURC-IVANOVmethod by DVWK (1996) and the monthly coefficients by Glugla and KoÌnig (1989). For Central Europe an increase of the Climatic Water Balance is projected for the winter months with exception of the southern parts. In summer (June to August) the potential water availability tends to decrease in whole Central Europe (see Fig. 3.2).
214,457,0.438,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"used. Most of the discussion in this book so far has concerned the scientiï¬c credibility of climate models. Salience requires that the information be relevant to a practitionerâs problem. More than legitimacy and credibility, this chapter is concerned with salience or relevance, which is difï¬cult to establish. Relevance or salience often brings forward the need for the evaluation of the data from climate model projections. This is evaluation beyond that performed in modeling centers and through scientiï¬c research papers. The characteristics of this evaluation are, often, that it is highly local, is application speciï¬c, and uses different variables (derived indices) than provided or evaluated by modeling centers. An example might be taking temperature or maximum temperature and estimating heat waves, or the stream flow in a particular river. The evaluation requires linking past performance with interpretations of the future. Just because a model reproduces the global average temperature or precipitation, that does not mean that the model reproduces the important characteristics of precipitation (frequency and intensity) at a particular location. Further evaluation is often necessary to evaluate models as ï¬t for a particular purpose. This evaluation step in the application of model data is necessary enough that model-data providers should conceive their data as the start of further evaluation rather than just focusing on the practitionerâs direct application of the data."

241,689,0.437,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"This chapter builds on the comprehensive summary of climate change scenarios in the ï¬rst BACC assessment published in 2008. This chapter ï¬rst addresses the dynamical downscaling of general circulation model (GCM) results to the regional scale, focussing on results from 13 regional climate model (RCM) simulations in the ENSEMBLES project as this European-scale ensemble simulation is also relevant for the Baltic Sea region and many studies on temperature, precipitation, wind speed and snow amounts have been performed. This chapter then reviews statistical downscaling studies that use large-scale atmospheric variables (predictors) to estimate possible future change in several smaller scale ï¬elds (predictands), with the greatest emphasis given to hydrological variables (such as precipitation and run-off). For the Baltic Sea basin, the ï¬ndings of the statistical downscaling studies are generally in line with studies employing dynamical downscaling."
320,124,0.435,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"between the kind of information models can provide and what managers of natural areas need. The perception of models differs between disciplines and between science and practice. Models range from semantic descriptions of assumed interrelations to computer based mathematical models; the term âmodelâ is often used for computer based models only. During recent decades, model-based prediction of biological responses to climate change has become a very active field of research. In the field of climate change modelling, models primarily enable understanding of global climate cycles. The development of models could demonstrate the impact of human activities on the earth climate system. Models serve to structure knowledge, to formulate hypotheses and to illustrate future developments. In the field of nature conservation management, the development of alternative scenarios is of special interest. Different management options may lead to different futures. Ex-ante assessment of the outcome of specific management measures in conjunction with different climate change impact scenarios may support management â but may also lead to deep frustration because of the high degree of uncertainty about future developments. Especially the necessary combination of different model types, such as climate models, vegetation models, and hydrological models, including all their underlying assumptions and uncertainties, renders it difficult for managers to identify useful options for decision making. Even though there have been extensive studies to model the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, the results are still sobering. In 2002 the IPCC found that âmost models of ecosystem changes are not well suited to projecting changes in regional biodiversityâ (IPCC 2002: 15). More and more authors have picked up this critical attitude towards the modelling of climate effects (e.g. Biesbroek et al. 2009; Opdam et al. 2009; Pyke et al. 2007). After a far-reaching survey of literature on conservation issues, Heller and Zavaleta (2009) concluded that âmany articles based on concrete modeling work or empirical studies of species responses to climate change tended either to not elaborate their results to management directives, or to present recommendations in vague terms such as, ârestoration should be consideredââ (Heller and Zavaleta 2009: 17). Therefore, Heller and Zavaleta highlighted the need to pay more attention of transferring modelling results into the decision context of management issues (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). This problem is not only limited to conservation management but to adaptation to climate change in general (Millner 2012). In this chapter we are describing concrete model approaches used to support decision-making within the HABIT-CHANGE project context. Facing climate change, climate impact models are currently seen as a big support for the development of alternative management scenarios. Handling uncertainties and understanding the âmodel cascadeâ will help in judging where models will supply useful information. A short overview of model approaches and their assumptions is presented as a basis for adaptive management and their benefits as well as limitations are discussed."
241,772,0.435,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(GCMs) used as surface boundary conditions in RCMs might be biased due to the coarse resolution of GCMs. Such biases would affect model sensitivity and hence the results in climate projections (Meier et al. 2011d). To reduce computational demands, scenario simulations were performed for selected time slices only (e.g. Madsen 2009) which requires the application of the âdeltaâ or âdelta changeâ approach (e.g. Meier 2002). Since the ï¬rst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea basin (BACC Author Team 2008), the number of relevant scenario simulations has increased considerably. In particular, a large number of scenario simulations were carried out during 2009â2011 within the ECOSUPPORT project (advanced modelling tool for scenarios of the Baltic Sea ECOsystem to SUPPORT decision making, www. baltex-research.eu/ecosupport). The following items characterise the new simulations compared to the ï¬rst BACC assessment: â¢ The horizontal resolution of atmosphere and ocean model components increased to typically less than 25 and 3.6 km, respectively (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). â¢ New model versions of GCMs and RCMs were used. â¢ The results and assumptions of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) were used instead of those from the IPCCâs Third Assessment Report (IPCC 2001). â¢ Multi-model ensemble modelling was introduced to estimate uncertainties due to biases in the Baltic Sea models (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). â¢ Instead of time slices often combined with the delta approach (e.g. Meier 2006), transient simulations (1960â 2100) were performed (e.g. Neumann 2010). â¢ Coupled physicalâbiogeochemical models were used (Neumann 2010; Meier et al. 2011a, b, c, 2012a, b, c; Eilola et al. 2012; Neumann et al. 2012). This chapter relies on literature concerning climate change scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea between 2007 and (March) 2012. The focus is on projected changes in water temperature, salinity, sea ice, storm surges, and wind waves. Changes in marine biogeochemical variables such as oxygen, nutrients, and phytoplankton (chlorophyll) concentrations are addressed in Chaps. 18 and 19. The graphics included in this chapter (with the exception of Fig. 13.6) show ensemble mean changes projected for 2069â2098 relative to a baseline/reference of 1978â2007 in transient scenario simulations calculated with three coupled physicalâ biogeochemical models for the Baltic Sea following Meier et al. (2011b, 2012c). The Baltic Sea models are forced with RCM data driven by two GCMs at the lateral boundaries and two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (SRES A1B and A2, see NakiÄenoviÄ et al. 2000). The atmospheric forcing ï¬elds of the RCM were analysed by Meier et al. (2011d). Results at six monitoring stations representing"
320,226,0.435,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"In HABIT-CHANGE the term impact is considered as a change in the state of a system caused by pressures like climate change or land use. The focus is set on environmental impacts esp. on habitats. Climate impacts may be positive or negative. They can be the result of extreme events or more gradual changes in climate variables showing either direct or indirect effects. Examples for direct impacts are changed abiotic conditions (e.g. soil moisture) for protected habitats. Examples of indirect impacts are changes of agricultural practices due to increasing drought stress. The framework for the assessment (Fig. 8.5) of climate-induced impacts on habitats results into overall impact magnitude values partitioned into the four time segment during the course of the year. The starting points in the impact assessment were the exposure values and the sensitivity derived from the indicator values. The parameter temperature (tas) and climatic water balance (cwb) were checked against the sensitivity of the indicators temperature and moisture. Subsequently, this resulted into the first impact values following the rules defined in Table 8.9 for Temperature and Table 8.10 for Moisture. In the example shown in Table 8.11, for the Temperature, the Indicator rules stated that all negative values should be ignored from further analysis. The Moisture was indifferent and therefore all low exposure values were removed. The sensitivity values from the regional expert knowledge assessment were used to weight the first impact values. This was done by summarising the values from temperature, moisture and regional sensitivity for"

241,668,0.432,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"One of the most important purposes of regional climate modelling is increasing knowledge of the real world (Laprise 2005). This additional knowledge is commonly termed âadded valueâ (Feser 2006). Identiï¬cation of AV is not an easy task. Small-scale atmospheric ï¬elds are usually less energetic than large-scale ï¬elds (Laprise 2005), so scale decomposition is sometimes necessary to separate the ï¬ner scales. Di Luca et al. (2012) used a diagram, adapted from Orlanski (1975) and von Storch (2005), to illustrate the concept of AV for the range of scales represented by global and regional models, relative to the characteristic temporal and spatial scales of atmospheric processes (Fig. 10.9). Regional climate modelling is mainly expected to add value at regional dimensions below 300 km and temporal scales less than 30 min, which are absent in GCMs. Evaluation of a hypothesis of AV implies a comparison of the performance of the RCM with that of the driving GCM (Feser et al. 2011). To date, the number of studies in which the AV of RCMs is directly analysed is limited and only a few concerns the Baltic Sea region. RCMs could provide AV by adding variability at scales not well resolved by GCMs (at Fig. 10.9 referred to as AV1). However, RCMs can also improve climate simulation at scales resolved by both RCMs and GCMs. This component of AV is referred as AV2 in Fig. 10.9. Because separation of scales is usually made while assessing AV, it is convenient to analyse both types of AV separately (Di Luca et al. 2012). RCMs operate in a limited domain, and two-way interactions between the regional domain and the rest of the globe do not usually occur. In many simulations, the spectral nudging technique ensures that the large scales are not altered too much by the regional model. For all these reasons, AV2 has not been clearly identiï¬ed and existing analyses are usually limited to AV1."

222,319,0.428,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"11.1 Introduction The combination of a highly variable climate, a large and increasing population and a high reliance on water dependent sectors such as agriculture means that South Asia could be particularly at risk to future climate change and variability. Changes in the climate occur in a variety of ways, including changes in mean temperature, changes in extreme daily maximum temperatures and changes in the length, frequency or magnitude of heatwaves. Similarly, increases or decreases in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation could affect water availability or change the characteristics of floods or droughts. For a monsoon climate, such as South Asia, changes in seasonality could also have a large impact on the quantities and timings of water availability, a critical factor in agrarian societies. Climate change and variability is therefore a key underpinning input into many of the biophysical models which form part of this research. The focus in this chapter is on climate projections J.

376,405,0.427,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","By contrast, there is no consistent relationship between biomass response to experimental warming and mean annual precipitation (MAP) across terrestrial plants studied (Fig. 7.6; Lin et al. 2010). Experimental warming has been shown to reduce soil water content by increasing evapotranspiration (Harte and Shaw 1995; Wan et al. 2005), with potentially negative effects on ANPP. Warming also may enhance productivity by alleviating low temperature limits on plant growth (Luo 2007; Lin et al. 2010) and increasing N mineralization (Rustad et al. 2001; Dijkstra et al. 2008). These opposing influences of warming may explain why many rangeland experiments have shown little consistent warming effect (Polley et al. 2013) and why interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation are smaller than expected from single-factor effects (Fig. 7.2b; Wu et al. 2011; Morgan et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2013). Corollary 4 Precipitation seasonality regulates ecosystem responses to both CO2 and warming. Warming and CO2 enrichment combined should lead to earlier and more rapid plant growth in ecosystems dominated by winter precipitation because warming will reduce temperature limitations on both growth and growth responses to CO2. On the other hand, warming may reduce CO2 benefits on arid and semiarid rangelands dominated by summer precipitation by increasing evaporative demand. The evaporative potential of air increases nonlinearly with temperature, such that a given increase in temperature will cause a disproportionately large increase in evaporative demand when temperature is high. Plant responses to CO2 enrichment alone also depend on the seasonal distribution of precipitation. CO2 stimulated ANPP of Australian grassland most during years when summer rainfall exceeded rainfall during spring and autumn (Hovenden et al. 2014). High rainfall during cool spring and autumn seasons may reduce production in this grassland by intensifying N limitation to plant growth."
320,70,0.427,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"In Central and Eastern Europe the mean annual temperature is projected to increase between 1 and 3  C until the middle of the century and up to 5  C by the end of the century (Giorgi et al. 2004; RaÌisaÌnen et al. 2004; Rowell 2005; Christensen et al. 2007; DeÌqueÌ et al. 2007; KjellstroÌm et al. 2007), if no policy measure is taken (IPCC 2007).

376,247,0.427,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","changes in soil water content can produce much larger changes in ecosystem processes, including soil CO2 efflux (Fay et al. 2011). A 15 % decrease in soil water that accompanied precipitation variability treatments caused measured responses to decrease by up to 40 %. In addition to modifying precipitation timing, year-round warming can cause a change in plant phenology and shift the seasonality of microbial activity with higher winter soil CO2 flux and lower summer soil CO2 flux. While the effects of changing precipitation variability and warming were modest compared to large between year variability, they are likely ecologically significant. While this experiment altered mean patterns, additional studies have begun looking at extreme events including the interactions between extreme drought and heat waves and found that even extreme warming had only modest effects on plant production and community composition and that the majority of observed changes were driven by soil water effects. In addition, drought and precipitation variability could impact ecosystem function. Drought has a greater impact when it occurs in the wettest portion of the year when organisms are most active, in contrast to typical seasonally dry periods. In addition, heat waves and droughts late in the growing season had no significant effects on ecosystem dynamics."

241,620,0.426,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"modelling of the complete hydrological cycle (e.g. BALTIMOS, Lehmann et al. 2004). Recently, Meier et al. (2011) showed that a coupled RCM of this type (RCAO) has the potential to improve the results in downscaling experiments driven by GCMs considerably because SSTs and sea ice concentrations are more realistic than those taken directly from the driving GCM. This adds a major caveat to the utility of other downscaling methods relying on SSTs from GCMs in the area, for example the RCM simulations from the ENSEMBLES project. In conventional RCM simulations, the driving model data are used only in the lateral boundary zone, while in the inner model domain, the RCM is not forced to the driving model. This causes an ill-posed boundary value problem and can lead to a different large-scale flow in the RCM simulation with respect to the driving model. In a perfect boundary setting, this âfreedomâ of the RCM may lead to considerable deviations between the real and simulated local climate state (e.g. Winterfeldt and Weisse 2009). With a nudging technique, the solution of the driving model can be prescribed for the whole RCM domain. However, by a scale-independent nudging method, the desired small-scale circulation features generated by the RCM would also be suppressed. In order to circumvent this clear disadvantage, the method of âspectral nudgingâ was introduced (von Storch et al. 2000; Feser et al. 2001), in which just the large-scale circulation is relaxed towards the driving model in the inner RCM domain, while the small-scale circulation remains untouched (large-scale constrained RCM simulation). This method leads to a system where empirical data (i.e. large-scale flow and surface details) are systematically combined with the theoretical understanding (i.e. the RCM). While the spectral nudging technique is now becoming more popular (e.g. Miguez-Macho et al. 2004; Castro et al. 2005), a debate on this technique is still ongoing; however, improvements through the application of spectral nudging are evident when the driving model represents a realistic large-scale flow, such as using reanalysis data as the driving model (Winterfeldt and Weisse 2009). In contrast, in the situation with a coarse GCM having an unrealistic large-scale circulation (caused by poorly represented topography due to the coarse resolution) as the driving model, even an RCM using spectral nudging could not alter the prescribed large-scale flow. In regions with complex terrain, the simulated flow in the reanalysis data and therefore the nudging constraints might themselves be biased. In such situations, spectral nudging might lead to unrealistic localscale flow (Radu et al. 2008). The ability of a non-nudged RCM to improve the large-scale climate inside its domain can be evaluated using the âBig Brotherâ approach (Denis et al. 2002). In this approach, a reference climate is established by performing a large-domain high-resolution RCM simulation"

The Met Office perturbed versions of HadCM3 with associated HadRM3P simulations for the 130-year period from 1971 to 2100 to create 17 ensemble results. Three members from this ensemble were selected, referred to as the Q0, Q8 and Q16 runs, respectively (see Table 15.1). The Q0 run represents exhibits a mid-range climate sensitivity to the A1B emissions forcing; Q16 has the highest climate sensitivity (i.e., it is the ensemble member that exhibits the highest global temperature response to the A1B emissions forcing); and finally, the Q8 run, although it has similar sensitivity to Q0, exhibits a different precipitation response. Specifically, unlike the other ensemble members, the Q8 run shows a mid-century decrease in precipitation (Table 15.1). The inclusion of the Q8 run therefore enables the impacts on sediment transfer processes of this possible climate response to be considered, even if the likelihood of this response can be considered to be relatively low. It was found that fluvial sediment delivery rates to the GBM delta associated with these climate data sets were all projected to increase under the influence of anthropogenic climate change, albeit with the magnitude of the increase varying across the Ganges and Brahmaputra catchments (Fig. 15.1). Of the two study basins, the Brahmaputraâs fluvial sediment load is predicted to be more sensitive to future climate change. By the middle part of the twenty-first century, model results suggest that sediment loads will increase (relative to the 1981â2000 baseline period) over a range of between 16 and 18 per cent (depending on climate model run) for the Ganges, but by between 25 and 28 per cent for the Brahmaputra.

376,395,0.424,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The combined effect of climate change drivers may differ from that anticipated by summing single-driver effects (Fig. 7.2; but see, Dukes et al. 2005). For instance, plant biomass responses to combined warming and CO2 enrichment treatments often are smaller than anticipated from single-factor experiments (Morgan et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012). Interactions also are evident in driver effects on plant community composition. Responses of foliar cover to experimental warming were species specific in an old field, varied through time, and were contingent on precipitation treatments (Engel et al. 2009). Warming may exacerbate effects of reduced precipitation on rangelands (Hovenden et al. 2008; Sherry et al. 2008), but the ecosystem consequences of the combination of climate change drivers generally are not as extreme as would be anticipated from single-driver effects (Wu et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012)."
214,471,0.423,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"12.3.1 Ensembles There are three typical types of climate-model ensemble projections. One is an ensemble of different models with the same conï¬guration, each running the same scenario. This is designed to focus on structural uncertainty in the models. Initial condition uncertainty is present, but it goes away for long experiments (over 50 years). It explicitly removes scenario uncertainty. The second type is a set of ensemble simulations with the same model and the same scenario that start with slightly different initial conditions to sample the initial condition or internal variability uncertainty. This explores the possible states in a single model conï¬guration, eliminating structural and scenario uncertainty. The third type of ensemble focuses on scenario uncertainty, for example, by running the same model for more than 50 years to remove model and initial condition uncertainty. All three types are used in climate analysis. Which type is used depends speciï¬cally on the application. For example, scenario uncertainty need not be treated on 20- to 50-year time horizons but dominates in the longer term. Using these different techniques leads to the conclusion that on the century scale scenario uncertainty is the largest uncertainty, not model uncertainty."
320,123,0.422,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Even if all political targets are met, climate change is expected to increase temperatures within the next decades globally and to change climate regimes locally, resulting in shifting water regimes and extreme weather events. In Central Europe temperatures are expected to increase and the climatic water balance, especially in summer, to decrease (see Sect. 3.3.1). Consequently, adaptation to climate change will become a necessity. Thus, it is crucial to overcome the notion that accepting the need for adaptation implies admitting the failure of climate policy. In fact, there are some instruments which provide high synergies between adaptation and mitigation, for example, in the area of forest conservation or ecosystem based adaptation as defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In short, adaptation to climate change is becoming increasingly important for nature conservation management. But adaptation to which specific climate change impacts? One answer is expected to come from the area of modelling. Modelling is increasingly important for understanding and projecting climate change impacts. Hence, model results can serve as a basis for adaptation. However, there is a gap K.

The amount of water in the soil column (a box of the land surface) is a result of precipitation falling from the atmosphere, runoff at the surface, and the motion of water in the soil column. These boxes also then exchange their properties with other boxes, such as water ï¬ltering deeper into the soil, or runoff going to an adjacent piece of the land surface. In addition, exchanges can occur with other pieces of the system: The precipitation falls onto the land from the atmosphere, evaporation goes into the atmosphere, and runoff goes into the ocean. These interactions can all be described at a particular time, and the effects can be calculated and used to update the state of the system. Key to this system are the descriptions of each process. Some examples of processes are the condensation of water vapor to form clouds, carbon dioxide uptake by plants, or the force on the ocean from the near-surface wind. Each of these processes introduces a forcing on the climate system. As we will learn, many of these processes are hard to describe completely, particularly for processes that occur at scales much less than the typical size of one grid box in a model. A climate model usually has one value for each substance (like water) or the wind speed in each large location, and it has to represent some average of the process, often by approximating key parameters. Parameterization is a concept used in many aspects of climate models (see box). The basic concept is like that of modeling itself: to represent a process as well as we can by approximations that flow from physical laws. Many of the approximations are required because of the small-scale nature of the processes. The goal of a parameterization is not to represent the process exactly. Instead, it is to represent the effect of that process at the grid scale of the model: to generate the appropriate forcing terms for the rest of the system and the rest of the processes. Parameterization Representing complex physical processes (clouds, chemistry, trees) in large-scale models is in some sense impossible. The French mathematician Laplace articulated a thesis of the reductionist worldview in the early 19th century: If one could have complete knowledge of every particle in the universe and the laws governing them, the future could simply be calculated. Of course, we cannot do that, so we seek to represent what we know about the behavior of particles, based on physical laws and empirical observation. For some processes, we can refer to the basic physical laws, which often have little uncertainty in them. The laws of how photons from the sun move through a well-mixed gas such as air are an example. Other processes are more complex, or variable on small scales. It is hard to derive laws from these processes. For instance, the flow of low-energy photons from the earth through air is somewhat uncertain because the laws governing how the energy interacts with water vapor are very complex. In the case of water vapor, the way the molecule is constructed it can absorb and release energy at many different wavelengths. For these processes, we often must use statistical"

I perform this aggregation by weighting each PRISM grid by the amount of cropland it contains based on USDAâs Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The CDL provides 30-m resolution land cover pixels corresponding to over 100 classes. The weights were based on cropland pixel counts falling within each PRISM data grid and the average of CDL cropland counts for years 2008â2014 were used. Note that temperature exposure to each temperature âbinâ or interval is computed by fitting a double sine curve going through the minimum and maximum temperature of each consecutive day for each PRISM grid and subsequently counting the time spent within each degree bin over the growing season in each year. The temperature exposure was then aggregated to county using the aforementioned approach. Key summary statistics are presented in Table 1 and correspond to a balanced panel of 644 counties over the 1981â2014 study period. This period is confined to years with complete climate data. The table shows maize yields vary considerably, ranging from 17.0 to 210.8 bu./acre. This variation obviously encompasses both cross-sectional (across counties) and longitudinal (within counties) dimensions. There is also a wide range of variation for precipitation over this time period with minimum and maximum levels of 110 and 1254 mm for the AprilâSeptember period. Following conventional practice, these months correspond were chosen to approximate the maize growing season in the region. Regarding air temperature, the present study relies on measurements of the temperature distribution across the entire growing season rather than average monthly temperature. In other words, the temperature variables correspond to the time spent within each temperature bin over the AprilâSeptember period. This approach is arguably better suited to capture exposure to extreme temperatures than monthly average temperatures. Although the statistical analysis makes use of exposure data to each bin ranging from 0 to 36 Â°C, I only present summary statistics for aggregated"

241,867,0.42,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Modelling historical and future changes in concentration and deposition shares many common features. In both cases, the models must be driven by âestimatesâ of meteorology rather than by observed meteorological ï¬elds. Hindcasting recent decades is easier than forecasting the future, although the lack of satellite data and other observations in earlier years makes such data less reliable than current numerical weather prediction systems can deliver. The most valuable historical data set for CTMs is ERA40, a set of meteorological data going back to 1957 that has been produced from global meteorological reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (Uppala et al. 2005). For future meteorology, many global climate models (i.e. general circulation models; GCMs) are available, but for estimating changes over the Baltic Sea region, it is better to run ï¬ner resolution models that are forced by GCMs and more capable of capturing the effects of local topography and land cover.

This influences our ability to detect and attribute changes at the regional scale as the simulations of recent change and variability deteriorate at smaller spatial scales. Third, forcing mechanisms that are less well understood such as changes in anthropogenic aerosols or that are thought to have a negligible effect on recent global warming such as land-cover changes may be relatively more important at the regional scale (Stott et al. 2010, see Chaps. 24 and 25 for further discussion). In addition, regional detection and attribution in northern Europe seems to be especially difï¬cult compared with other subcontinental regions worldwide. Owing to the position of northern European landmasses at the end of the North Atlantic storm track and due to the complex landâsea distribution, interannual variability in most climatic parameters is very strong, thus masking external influences (see Fig. 9.12 in Hegerl et al. 2007a). In these cases, all that is possible is to assess whether the simulated response to external forcing is consistent with the observed change."
214,280,0.418,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Regional climate models2 are also three-dimensional dynamical systems models, but with smaller domains. As a result. they often contain often more detailed processes. They are run with boundary conditions from observations or from GCMs (other models) when no observations are available (i.e., in the future). Regional climate models are often used to generate high-resolution and high-frequency weather statistics to understand how broad-scale climate change alters weather patterns. Examples of regions might be Western Europe, the Arctic, or the continental United States. The atmosphere models used are often models that are used for weather prediction, that resolve the scales of weather systems from 3 to 125 miles (5â200 km). These are often called mesoscale models (meso = medium). These are an effective way to âdownscaleâ the large-scale general circulation (and potential changes) to generate better weather statistics by driving dynamical models at high resolution with the output from a global model (see box in next section). Why is higher resolution (smaller grid boxes) better? One strong driver for local weather and climate is the physical environment, especially topography (landforms and changes in elevation) that affects both the atmosphere and the ocean. At lower"
320,93,0.418,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Besides climate change and land use change direct human interventions can affect natural runoff processes. When analysing the effects of such changes a clear differentiation between the natural discharge affected by climate change and land use change, and managed streamflow should be made. Therefore particularly in regions with large anthropogenic water use or water management effects, e.g. reservoir management or water transfers, natural runoff processes and the resulting natural discharge should be distinguished from measured (and managed) streamflow. In the project GLOWA-Elbe (Wechsung et al. 2011) an eco-hydrological model for the river Elbe basin was developed to simulate the effects of climate change and land use change on natural runoff. A water resources management model was used to simulate the effects of water management on streamflow and water availability. In the example presented in Fig. 3.4 climate change and land use change are considered in the simulation of the (unmanaged) natural runoff using the eco-hydrological model SWIM. From 100 realisations of future climate data, all assuming a temperature increase of approximately 1.8  C by 2055, a corresponding number of realisations of natural discharge are generated (Conradt et al. 2012). This natural discharge is an important input for the water resources management model. Simulated in the water resources management model (WBalMoÂ®1 Elbe) are all relevant water users with their water demand and return flows, and the management of the water infrastructure, i.e. reservoirs and water transfers."

The current annual average temperature in the Macedon Ranges region is 14.8 Â°C with an observed warming of 0.7 Â°C over the last century. The average rainfall for the region is between 750 and 800 mm per year. There has been an observed trend of approximately 3 mm reduction in rainfall per decade over the last 110 years. For example, the recent drought period saw a 20â25 % reduction in annual average rainfall.

376,178,0.416,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Remote-sensing technology has a long history in rangeland management (e.g., Prince and Tucker 1986). One of its key advantages is that it enables extrapolation not just in space, but also temporally, offering insight into change of vegetation pattern and development through time. Rapid developments in remote-sensing-based hydrological monitoring are providing unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage in estimates of hydrological variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, ET (Kustas et al. 1994; Garcia et al. 2008), surface water level (Alsdorf et al. 2000), and groundwater storage (Yeh et al. 2006). In rangelands, the irregular spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall imposes key constraints on ecosystem function and development. Remote measurement of precipitation has an extensive history, with numerous hydrological investigations being informed by the two-decade-long Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite system (Kummerow et al. 2000) and related sensors. Over the coming years, the next generation of satellite rainfall-measuring systems, referred to as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, will provide a muchneeded update to the space-based rainfall monitoring capacity.

Additionally, the 2009â2010 growing season serves as the baseline period for weather conditions and all prices used in the simulations. It is important to note also that the direct reliance of the model on data for the estimation of yield functions and input usages restricts the scope of crops and agricultural techniques that are considered in the simulations to those that are in wide use during the 2009â2010 Malawian growing season and that, more in general, characterize Malawi agricultural production.

The oceans might be represented by one column for each ocean. Intermediate complexity models capture some of the basic energy budget components and limited circulation. These models are used when the needed climate variables are simple. Simple outputs might be the average surface temperature or precipitation in a region or over an entire country. These outputs can then be used to efï¬ciently drive a country-level economic model. Finally, we come to models that have ï¬nite elements covering the earth. These can be regional (a regional climate model3) or global. Regional climate models or limited-area models have boundaries: They do not represent the entire surface of the earth (see Fig. 5.5e). The limited area enables them to be run with ï¬ner resolution than a global model. Finer horizontal resolution is good for representing the effects of surface features like mountains (topography). If you want to understand the climate of a region near or within mountain ranges, it is critical to represent the effects of the mountains correctly. This may be easy to understand in terms of a small region like a mountain valley, or the region on the dry side of a mountain range away from the coast, such as eastern Oregon in the United States, or the high deserts on the Andes mountain range in Peru and Chile. Limited-area models may also include more processes because they represent smaller regions with fewer boxes, a limited domain. The difï¬culty is that they have âedgesâ or boundaries: Air must blow into and out of them, along with the energy associated with the air, and water in vapor or in clouds (the âblowingâ around is also called transport, or advection). Limited-area model boundaries (the region just outside the domain of the model) have to be deï¬ned from somewhere to determine what values are given to the model at the boundary. For examining present-day climate, the conditions at the boundary can be taken from observations, often using data collected for large-scale weather prediction. Indeed, many ï¬ne scale models of weather have limited domains. For climate prediction, limited-area models are difï¬cult because the boundaries mean energy and mass can leave the model (nonconservation). It is a challenge, however, to use these models for the future, since they need to have speciï¬ed future boundary conditions. The results are often or usually strongly dependent on the boundary conditions speciï¬ed. But these models, with their small grid spacing and detailed representation of processes, are good for representing details of local climate variation through weather events: extremes of precipitation and temperature, for example. Models with a global grid are good for representing the overall patterns of motion of the atmosphere (see Fig. 5.5f). They have no horizontal boundaries. These global grids are known as General Circulation Models (GCMs). They need only a top (space) and a bottom (the surface of the earth) boundary condition. The"

Even with no net global change, there can still be regional changes in climate. The spread in results from the different formulations of climate models is due to different forcing and different responses to forcing. The response to a forcing includes all the feedbacks in the system that determine (in Fig. 11.2) how the system will respond to climate forcing. A larger response to the same forcing is a more sensitive climate (higher sensitivity). Note in particular that given the spread in models (model uncertainty, the shaded regions in Fig. 11.2), the scenario uncertainty is dominant after 2060 or so (the shaded regions no longer overlap). The model predictions of this scenario are within these bands, and thus the resulting surface temperature really depends on the scenario uncertainty after the middle of this century. The current generation of models is not likely to be very wrong. Counting on the scientiï¬c community to be very wrong on these metrics is not a prudent strategy. The global surface temperature record is far from smooth, which makes understanding and attributing these large-scale curves difï¬cult. In fact, there is plenty of evidence of the âï¬ts and startsâ to the global average surface temperature.

241,1419,0.411,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"There are few studies of land coverâclimate interactions before AD 1850, although the number has increased rapidly since 2009. To date, there are no published modelling studies on the possible feedbacks of CLCC on past natural climate warming such as the well-known Early Holocene increase in mean annual temperatures and on the effects of Late Holocene CLCC and/or ALCC on later climate changes such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (warming) and the Little Ice Age (cooling, see also Chap. 3), except that of Pongratz et al. 2009b. However, simulations of the northwards expansion of trees due to a warmer climate showed that such climate-induced vegetation changes produced a positive feedback on climate (e.g. Cheddadi et al. 1997). There is only one study of the effect of past ALCC on regional climate in Europe using a regional climate model, the LANDCLIM project (Gaillard et al. 2010; Strandberg et al. 2013). The aim of the study was to evaluate the direct effects of anthropogenic deforestation on simulated climate at two contrasting times of the Holocene *6000 BP and *200 BP in Europe applying RCA3, a regional climate model with 50 km spatial resolution (Samuelsson et al. 2011). Three alternative descriptions of the past vegetation were used: (i) potential natural vegetation (V) simulated by the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (Smith et al. 2001), (ii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land cover (deforestation) as simulated by the HYDE model (V + H), and (iii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land cover as simulated by the KK model (V + K). The climate model results show that the simulated effects of deforestation depend on both local/regional climate and vegetation characteristics (Strandberg et al. 2013). At *6000 BP, the extent of simulated deforestation in Europe is generally small, but there are areas where deforestation as simulated by Kaplan et al. (2009) (V + K) is large enough to produce signiï¬cant differences in summer temperature of 0.5â1 Â°C, which is the case in southern Sweden and eastern Poland. However, the KK model overestimates deforestation in these areas compared to the pollen-based REVEALS reconstructions. At *200 BP, simulated deforestation is much more extensive than previously assumed, in particular according to the pollen-based REVEALS reconstructions (see Sect. 25.3.3.3) and the KK model. This leads to signiï¬cant temperature differences in large parts of Europe. In winter, deforestation leads to lower temperatures because of the differences in albedo between forested and unforested areas, particularly in the snow-covered regions. In summer, deforestation leads to higher temperatures in Central and eastern Europe since evapotranspiration from unforested areas is lower than from forests (hydrological cycle effect)."
241,693,0.411,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"resulted in extensive analyses of possible climatic futures for areas including the Baltic Sea basin (e.g. Lind and KjellstrÃ¶m 2008; KjellstrÃ¶m and Lind 2009; Benestad 2011; KjellstrÃ¶m et al. 2011a; Nikulin et al. 2011). Probabilistic climate change information has been derived from the GCM scenarios (RÃ¤isÃ¤nen 2010) and RCM scenarios (Buser et al. 2010; Donat et al. 2011). In addition, the wider range of GCM scenarios has been used to set regional scenarios in a broader context (Lind and KjellstrÃ¶m 2008). This chapter relies on existing literature on climate change scenarios with a focus on northern Europe and in particular the Baltic Sea region. Some original summarising plots of public data from the ENSEMBLES project have been added because not all of the expected analyses of the ENSEMBLES archive have yet been published; at the same time, this collection of RCM data is an essential improvement on the state of the science since the ï¬rst BACC assessment. For a more detailed description of GCMs and downscaling techniques, see Chap. 10 as well as IPCC (2007) and BACC Author Team (2008) and references therein. Much literature exists related to past and present climate change in the Baltic Sea, and conversely about future climate at the European scale, but there is little targeted research on future climate change in the Baltic Sea area. Most RCMs do not include a dynamic ocean model, implying that the surface properties for the Baltic Sea (sea surface temperaturesâSSTsâand sea ice) are taken directly from the driving GCM. As the GCMs have only a very crude representation of the Baltic Sea, this constitutes an additional source of uncertainty for the regional scenarios. Based on experiments with the Rossby Centre RCM RCAO in both coupled and uncoupled mode, Meier et al. (2011) concluded that the coupled model version has the potential to improve the results of downscaling considerably, as SSTs and sea-ice conditions are more realistic than in the corresponding GCMs. However, their results show that differences between the two model versions are different between different seasons with a greater improvement in summer compared to winter, since winter climate in the Baltic Sea region is more strongly governed by conditions over the North Atlantic. They also concluded that the parameterisation of air-sea fluxes needs improving in RCAO. The rest of this chapter focuses on results from atmosphere-only RCMs available at the time of writing (November 2012)."

A statistical crop yield model is basically a regression analysis of crop yields on weather variables. Early examples can be traced back to the early part of the last century (Wallace 1920; Hodges 1931). In this chapter, I adopt the approach developed more recently by Schlenker and Roberts (2009). These authors developed an innovative approach that separately estimates the effect of the cumulative exposure (over the growing season) to different temperature bins on crop yield.4 Mathematically, the nonlinear effect of temperature on yield may be represented by"

Examples include spreadsheets that try to predict budgets of money or goods. Some of these models are numerical. Climate models are usually not statistical but contain some processes represented with observed climate statistics, and equations built from physical theory. Essentially, a climate model is a giant representation of the âbudgetâ of mass (of water, of carbon) and of energy in the climate system. A climate model is an attempt at representing the critical budgets and flows in the climate system in a way that they obey the basic laws of physics we observe all around us."
167,141,0.408,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"Abstract Climate warming has been and will continue to be faster in the Arctic compared to the other domains of the world, which generates major challenges for human adaptation. Among others, the development of socio-economic infrastructure and strategic planning requires long-term projections of water availability and extreme hydrological events. In this context, it is preferable that the projections of river runoff should be performed statistically, allowing the evaluation of economical risks and costs for hydraulic structures, which are connected to changes in hydrological extremes. In this study, the hydrological model MARCS (MARcov Chan System) is suggested as a tool to simulate the parameters of probability density functions (PDFs) of maximal runoff or peak flow, based on climate projections of the Representative Concentration Pathways. Following that, the PDFs of the maximal runoff were constructed within the Pearson Type III distributions to estimate the runoff values of a small exceedance probability. To evaluate the risks and costs of a long-term investment based on the future projections of river maximal discharge of 1 % probability, simple calculations were performed for the new bridge over the Nadym River as an example."
241,1415,0.408,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"net radiation energy at the surface is used for vertical heat transfer than for evapotranspiration (see also Bonan 2008). However, woodland can also sustain its evapotranspiration rate when water availability is low, which leads to lower Bowen ratios than in grassland in dry conditions; that is, grassland becomes the source of excess heating instead of woodland. There are still important problems in relation to how ALCCs are explored in numerical experiments using climate models. Pielke et al. (2011) concluded that most studies were based on only one or two models, which did not reflect the uncertainty between models in their responses to increased CO2 levels or in the strength of their landâatmosphere interactions, an uncertainty that is evident in the LUCID multi-model study of Pitman et al. (2009). That study mainly focused on the Northern Hemisphere summer season, and the key result was a statistically signiï¬cant impact of ALCC on the simulated latent heat flux and air temperature over the regions where anthropogenic land cover changed, but the direction of the change in summer temperature was inconsistent among the models. In terms of rainfall, four of the coupled atmosphereâland models used showed a signiï¬cant impact on rainfall over regions with ALCC, while three models did not show impacts greater than the expected random variability of model outputs (Seneviratne et al. 2010). In their review, Pitman et al. (2009) did not ï¬nd statistically signiï¬cant impacts of ALCC on latent heat flux, temperature or rainfall remote from the actual ALCC, that is no teleconnections. The authors also suggested that robust conclusions on the effects of ALCCs on climate can only be drawn from multi-model experiments. Studies based on a single model only provide indications of possible feedback mechanisms and their implications. The goal of the most recently published part of the LUCID project (de Noblet-DucoudrÃ© et al. 2012) was to provide a detailed examination of why the LSMs diverge in their response to ALCC. For this purpose, the authors used seven atmosphereâland models with a common experimental design. For the vegetation distribution, each model used as a starting point the same distribution of crop and pasture, at a resolution of 0.5Â° Ã 0.5Â°, as extracted from Ramankutty and Foley (1999), combined with the pasture areas from Klein Goldewijk et al. (2011) (Fig. 25.8). However, as there are between-model differences in (i) the way land information was represented, (ii) sources of information to describe present-day and potential vegetation, and (iii) strategies to implement ALCC in the model, the resulting land-cover distribution (including natural vegetation) used in each model differed (de Noblet-DucoudrÃ© et al. 2012; Fig. 25.8). Although the areas covered by crops increased from AD 1870 to AD 1992 in all land-cover data sets used, the increase varied; all LSMs describe temperate deforestation, but at"

241,808,0.407,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"uncertainty in the DSL response near the Baltic Sea is estimated to be Â±20 cm by considering the spread in the ensemble (Yin et al. 2010; Pardaens et al. 2011). This uncertainty is greater than the projected DSL changes in the region. Freshwater fluxes arising from a negative GrIS mass balance have been shown to perturb the North Atlantic circulation and thus induce changes in SSH (Stammer 2008; Hu et al. 2009, 2011; Stammer et al. 2011). The model runs in the CMIP3 archive have not been forced with the additional freshwater flux coming as a consequence of decay of land-based ice masses. Hu et al. (2011) modelled the combined effect of forcing a model with both the SRES A1B scenario and a freshwater hosing from the GrIS. Using an unrealistically large hosing flux equivalent to 60 cm of global sea-level rise results in an additional global average steric contribution of about 2 cm by the end of the twentyï¬rst century and that the hosing has little detectable influence on DSL near Scandinavia and in the Baltic Sea. Stammer et al. (2011), however, found that atmospheric feedbacks increase the hosing response signiï¬cantly in the North Atlantic."
214,168,0.407,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Climate models of the atmosphere come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from simple idealized models with no dimensions, to complex models with high spatial resolution over particular regions or the whole planet. Both regional and global climate models are valuable. Regional models are often coupled to other scales to perform detailed experiments. The processes represented in an atmosphere model include the equations of motion and the various forcing terms that come from energy flows, motion, and transformations. Moisture is critical in the transformation and storage of energy. Models have to approximate processes occurring on many scales with parameterizations to derive the source and sink terms for the equations of motion and heat that are iterated forward in time. Key processes include clouds, radiative flows of heat, and chemistry, as well as small-scale forcing of motions. Representing the variations in processes on small scales correctly can be difï¬cult. Most of the uncertainty in the models results from missing or incorrect processes and particularly from the interactions across scales that cannot be represented. Feedbacks between processes can be complex and are not easy to observe. Cloud feedbacks are highly uncertain in atmosphere modeling. We return to many of these ideas in Chaps. 6 and 7, on the other model components of the climate system. Key Points â¢ A hierarchy of atmosphere models exist. â¢ Global models reproduce the general circulation patterns of the climate. â¢ Physical processes in atmosphere models are complex. Clouds and radiation are key processes.

241,634,0.405,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"10.3.2.4 Weather Generators Stochastic weather generators are statistical models producing high-resolution local-scale time series of a suite of elements such as temperature and precipitation among others, whose large-scale statistics follow the required criteria (Richardson 1981; Wilks and Wilby 1999; Olsson et al. 2009; Willems and Vrac 2011). Among many applications, they can serve as a computationally effective tool to produce site-speciï¬c data sets at the required time resolution (Semenov et al. 1998). The distribution used is usually different for different climate variables. For temperature, the normal distribution is the most popular (Semenov et al. 1998). More complicated is the generation of precipitation data, and different functions are used. Among the most popular are the Markov chain, the semi-empirical, and the NeymanâScott rectangular pulse (NSRP) weather generator. In the Markov chain generator, precipitation occurrence and totals are produced separately (Sunyer et al. 2012). Two states are possible: wet or dry days. The amount of precipitation on a rainy (wet) day is most often generated using a gamma or exponential distribution (Benestad 2007). In the semi-empirical generator, a few distributions can be deï¬ned, for instance for wet and dry spell lengths and precipitation amount. In the NSRP weather generator, Kilsby et al. (2007) proposed four different steps. A storm origin is described by the Poisson process. Separate rain cells within a storm are separated by time intervals taken from exponential distribution. The duration and intensity of each rain cell are also described by exponential distributions, and their sum gives a rainfall total. Weather generators can be used when the observation records are relatively short. They can also supply many weather ârealisationsâ having the same overall statistics. A wide suite of statistics can be used to ï¬t the model: mean, variance, skewness, autocorrelation, and many others. Weather generators can also serve to produce data for locations where there is information about the statistical distribution and time structure. For places with only short records of high-temporal-resolution data but longer series with data of low resolution, it is possible to use information from the longer records to make inferences about the distributions, and it is in principle possible to produce projections for temporal scales higher than those usually produced by RCMs (6 h). 10.3.2.5 Randomisation Models generally underestimate the local-scale variance. To resolve this, Karl et al. (1990) proposed the use of a scaling factor to ensure that the variance of the projected surface values will match the observed variance. But this could"

214,408,0.405,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"11.2.1 Goals of Prediction What exactly do we want to know from climate models? The basic answer is an estimate of the future climate, deï¬ned as the distribution of weather states. Climate is a function of space and time (summer climate, winter climate, particular location). We may also want an estimate of things derived from climate: stream flow, consecutive days above or below a threshold (heat and cold waves), or with and without precipitation (floods and droughts). The climate of the future is a function of the uncertainties we have discussed: initial condition uncertainty, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. On short timescales (a few days to a decade), initial condition (and internal variability) uncertainty dominates, and on century (or half-century) timescales, scenario uncertainty dominates. Model uncertainty remains over time, but may be signiï¬cant. Model uncertainty remains signiï¬cant at small scales, where model structural errors are important: If a model puts the storm track in the wrong place, it can consistently move storms (i.e., weather, precipitation) in incorrect ways and create"

320,71,0.399,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"The model output is taken from various regional model simulations driven by different European Global Climate Models produced in the European project ENSEMBLES (van der Linden and Mitchell 2009). The projections up to 2100 use a common forcing under A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario. The European warming will be higher than the global mean temperature increase. As can be seen in Fig. 2.3 this temperature increase is different from region to region and season to season. In the autumn and winter months the temperature change in North and Eastern Europe will be higher (up to 3  C) compared to South Europe (1â1.5  C). The warming in winter increases from the western coastal regions of Europe to the eastern continental interiors (Giorgi et al. 2004; Rowell 2005). This can be mainly explained through two mechanisms. The first is the influence of the rather modest warming of the ocean on the climate of the western parts of Europe (Rowell 2005), and the second is the snow albedo feedback mechanism. If the warming depletes the snow cover, the albedo decreases and more solar radiation reaches the surface, which in turn enhances the surface warming, accelerates the snow depletion, and sustains a positive feedback mechanism (Giorgi et al. 2004; Rowell 2005; KjellstroÌm et al. 2007). Furthermore, the minimum temperatures have risen most, leading to decreased winter temperature variability (RaÌisaÌnen et al. 2004). Adversely, in summer the increase in the south of up to 2.5  C is larger than in the north with an increase of less than 2  C. The projected increase in daily mean temperature varies overall. The model projections show a clear warming trend for the future, although there are regional and seasonal differences in the magnitude of the projected temperature increase.

365,513,0.399,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"distribution of rainfall are quite uncertain, with no clear agreement among climate models on whether rainfall would rise or fall. The combination of changes in temperature and precipitation shows biophysical impacts that can have significant consequences for the agriculture and related water sector. The likely negative impacts of climate change on rainfed agriculture and the increased uncertainty about water resources available in the future make it essential to consider climate change into agricultural sector planning. Indeed agriculture will mainly be affected by loss of yields for the main crops (cassava, millet, yam, maize, sorghum, and rice), even if precipitation increases in several parts of the country. The effects are fairly clear in the longer term but somehow more ambiguous in the shorter term (2020) when, according to more than half of the climate models, cassava, and perhaps other crops, might actually experience an increase in productivity. The projected decline in rainfed yields along with projected rises in temperature might ultimately reduce food security. It is projected that half of Nigeriaâs agroecological zones will be food insecure by 2020 and 75% by 2050 unless their diminishing local food production is complemented by improved in-country trade or more imports. Impacts on water resources are more uncertain, but it looks very likely that availability of water for storage and use will be different from the past. In particular, our analysis suggests that, by 2050, in only 23% of the country the hydrological regime will remain stable. In the rest of the country, the hydrology of the future will be very different than today, with 50% of the country expected to have higher runoff than the historical average, 10% of the country projected to be exposed to drier conditions, and 33% of total land area will be uncertain as climate models disagree so much that is difficult to define where runoff will increase or decrease. The decline in crop yields will have significant consequences also for the national economy, by 2050 reducing GDP (compared to the no-climate change scenario) by up to 4.5%. Climate change is also projected to increase net import of various crops, particularly rice and other cereals. The major policy implication of our analysis is that ignoring the effects of climate change in the design of agriculture policies, programs and projects would have dire consequences on the sectorâs development prospects, and indeed on the countryâs overall growth. At the same time, because of large uncertainties on the magnitude, speed and, in the case of precipitation, even direction of change, there is no silver bullet to consider in the design of climate change adaptation interventions. In fact, selecting the wrong adaptation response to climate change may have costs as large as not adapting at all. In the case of the rainfed agriculture, the adoption of certain adaptation technologies (e.g. the shift in sowing date) may turn out be illsuited for some crops or agro-ecological regions, and result in a net decline in yields, rather than reducing climate change impacts. Similarly, development of irrigation schemes may lead to wrong-sizing of the amount of storage or irrigated area, both if climate change is ignored, and if a single scenario of climate change is arbitrarily selected (instead of considering the full range of possible outcomes)."

222,451,0.397,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"and quantification undertaken during the project (Chaps. 9, 11 and 14). In total there are five simulations for fluvial and related flooding and five simulations for storm surge flooding due to cyclonic events. Sea-level rise projections for these scenarios were based on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5, Church et al. 2013, see also Chap. 14). Mid-century rise was taken as 0.24 m, compared to a baseline in 2000, and end-century rise as 0.54 m. The 0.54 m value is quite conservative and in particular omits any potential contribution from melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The extreme end-century value used in some simulations in this chapter, 1.5 m, is based on the high-end estimates from AR5 with an additional 0.5 m for ice sheet melting (Kay et al. 2015). Subsidence is added to local sea-level rise but has not been included in the research presented due to the uncertainty in predicting subsidence in protected and non-protected land. However, subsidence rates are estimated to be of the order 2.5 mm/ year (Brown and Nicholls 2015) so could add an additional 0.25 m by the end of the century (see also Chap. 15). The areal extent of inundation due to these present and future conditions is given in Table 16.1. Compared to the base year condition, the present-day extreme flood is doubled in the inundated area. The presentday extreme flood condition corresponds roughly to a flood with 100 year return period (Islam and Chowdhury 2002). In the future there is a tendency for a large increase in flooded area, but not in all cases. By the end of the century (end-century extreme scenario), the flooded area increases by 231 per cent compared to the base year and 65 per cent compared to the present extreme. This scenario might cause overtopping of the coastal embankments (Nihal et al. 2016), and needs further evaluation. It should be noted that while sea-level rise dominates the change, increases in upstream discharges are also significant (see Whitehead et al. 2015a, b). Maps of the flooded areas are shown in Fig. 16.1. Unprotected areas in the north of the study area are inundated due to changes in the discharge of the upstream rivers during the monsoon season (May to October). At the onset of monsoon, river water inundates any unprotected land and rises to its peak, generally in August or September (see Table 16.1). The influence of tides is minimal in these areas, except when monsoon winds and resulting elevated sea levels during the spring tide can delay drainage"
241,1298,0.397,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The influence of external forcing is more difï¬cult to detect at smaller spatial scales (Stott and Tett 1998; Zwiers and Zhang 2003). At the grid-box scale of global climate models (approx. 300 Ã 300 km), the observed warming up to 2002 in the Baltic Sea region is not signiï¬cantly different from changes due to internal variability alone, and therefore, an anthropogenic influence is not detectable (Karoly and Wu 2005). However, the simulated warming in the Baltic Sea area is consistent with the observed warming when anthropogenic forcing (changes in greenhouse gas and sulphate concentrations) is included in the simulations with three different global climate models (the GFDL R30, HadCM2 and PCM models, Karoly and Wu 2005). The observed warming is also found to be consistent with anthropogenic signals derived from simulations with a coupled regional atmosphereâocean model (Bhend and von Storch 2009), whereas van Oldenborgh et al. (2009) found signiï¬cant differences between observed and simulated warming in spring (MAM) using global climate models. They identiï¬ed the misrepresentation in circulation and snow cover changes as the main reason for the underestimation of warming in spring in global climate models. A recent study by Flanner et al. (2009) suggested that the underestimation of springtime warming at mid-latitudes is due to the lack of carbonaceous aerosols in climate model simulations. These particles darken the snow surface and thus increase the albedo, leading to a warming especially in spring when the snow surface is exposed to intense solar radiation (see Chap. 24 for discussion of the local effects of aerosols). Whereas this forcing mechanism was not included in previous climate model simulations, most models submitted to the World Climate Research Programmesâs CMIP5 (Taylor et al. 2011) database include carbonaceous aerosols, which implies that the role of carbonaceous aerosols may be addressed in future attribution studies. In addition to analyses using local information only (e.g. observed and simulated data for the Baltic Sea area), evidence for a regional anthropogenic warming is also found in formal detection and attribution studies using global constraints (Christidis et al. 2010b). Pooling climate data information across the globe helps to signiï¬cantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of externally forced changes. The additional information available when carrying out analyses simultaneously for multiple regions further helps to distinguish responses to different forcings that may be indistinguishable in individual regions. Using such an approach, Christidis et al. (2010b) detected and attributed human influence on the observed warming in northern Europe from 1950 to 1997 (see Fig. 23.1). The authors also computed the fraction of attributable risk (FAR, Stott et al. 2004) of the observed warming in northern Europe. FAR is a measure of the change in likelihood of a given warming in a world with human influence compared to the likelihood of such a"
214,468,0.397,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"simpliï¬es the range of choices important for a particular problem. Many planning and management activities have small spatial scales and timescales of the next three to ï¬ve decades; thus, the choice of emissions scenario is less important and the representation of internal variability is more important. Large model uncertainty argues strongly for intensive speciï¬c evaluation of model uncertainty (e.g., if the issue is snowpack, is the current temperature correct in the model?) or even the use of multiple models (multiple-model ensembles). Scenario uncertainty is also associated with the impacts side of the problem. Recall the example of the impact of tropical cyclones on a coastline. That impact will change over time with the built environment, as well as with changes in cyclones. So the scenario for practitioners may also include aspects of the human or natural system impacts that are not treated by the climate model. One difï¬culty is consistency: If impact scenarios are estimated, like the built environment on a coastline, they should be consistent with the climate scenarios. The human side of the problem may matter between different scenarios, even if the climate projection is similar, as in the case for the example of the built environment around a coastline. Even if cyclones do not signiï¬cantly change in 30â50 years, the built environment might very well change. The human narrative in scenarios for climate prediction is evolving in 2015, and the current versions of climate scenarios (beyond the RCPs that predict emissions) are called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).7 These scenarios contain not just emissions, but also the growth assumptions used to estimate the emissions, and a narrative describing the assumptions about the future of society. Initial condition uncertainty is most important when the goal of the simulation is to represent actual âclimate forecastsâ rather than representative âclimate projections.â Projections are often conditional: Given a set of emissions, the expected result is a speciï¬c climate. But a forecast is more speciï¬c. What will happen to the climate in 2020, or 2055 (the latter is more of a projection). The deterministic weather forecast problem is a classic example of a problem that relies strongly on accurate and complete initial conditions. In climate applications, the early decades of a simulation depend strongly of the initialization of the ocean. It is possible for the same model to determine quite different climates from different initializations, which is a motivation for ensemble results. Even if the initializations were (impossibly) perfect, model errors would lead to imperfect forecasts. There are methods for mathematical quantiï¬cation of uncertainty. These methods for uncertainty quantiï¬cation involve understanding how perturbations to the different sources of uncertainty change the results. The computational demands of climate models as well as the complexity make brute-force methods of uncertainty quantiï¬cation impractical. The uncertainty in a few parameters can be assessed explicitly, by varying different parameters over a range. This is hard to do with"
169,323,0.397,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"medium time scales (up to the 2050s), uncertainties in hydrological models can be greater than climate model uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the results of the hydrological model is larger than the predicted change induced by altered climate conditions and thus having no signiï¬cant meaning. In alpine regions, glaciers can contribute appreciable amounts of water to the discharge of rivers. All projections for the twenty-ï¬rst century show continuing net mass loss from glaciers. In glaciered catchments, runoff reaches an annual maximum during summer, which strongly inï¬uences river thermal conditions as well. Reduced contributions from glacial runoff induce shifts of peak ï¬ows toward spring. Furthermore, the reduced glacial input can lead to more erratic and variable discharge dynamics in response to rain events. The relative importance of high-summer glacier meltwater can be substantial, for example, contributing 25% of August discharge in basins draining the European Alps (Huss 2011). Observations and models suggest that global warming impacts on glacier and snow-fed streams and rivers will pass through two contrasting phases. In the ï¬rst phase, river discharge increases due to intensiï¬ed melting. In the second phase, snowï¬elds melt early and glaciers have shrunken to a point that late-summer streamï¬ow is strongly reduced. The turnover between the ï¬rst and second phase is called âpeak meltwater.â Peak meltwater dates have been projected between 2010 and 2040 for the European Alps (Huss 2011). River discharge also inï¬uences the response of thermal regimes to increased air temperatures. Simulated discharge decreases of 20 and 40% may result in additional increases of river water temperature of 0.3 and 0.8  C on average (Van Vliet et al. 2011). Consequently, where drought becomes more frequent, freshwater-dependent biota will suffer directly from changed ï¬ow conditions and also from droughtinduced river temperature increases. Furthermore, increased temperature will accompany decreased oxygen and increased pollutant concentrations. Hydrology itself is a driver of aquatic communities, and disturbances, such as ï¬oods, have regulatory effects on riverine biota as dominant populations are reduced, pioneers are supported, and free niches are opened. Hydrological dynamics are therefore essential to maintain overall biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Riverine species have evolved speciï¬c life-cycle adaptations to seasonal differences in hydrological regimes that are speciï¬c to different eco- and bioregions. For instance, larval growth rates of benthic invertebrates are high during winter as the hydraulic stress is reduced in low-ï¬ow periods in alpine rivers. Disturbances, such as acyclic extreme events, may be linked with severe losses in biomass, with species richness, and with the selection of species-speciï¬c traits. Unstable environments favor small, adaptive species with short life cycles, whereby larger organisms with longer life spans are generally handicapped (Townsend and Hildrew 1994; see Chap. 4)."

ARMA(p, q) models have been extended to describe seasonal flow series by having their coefï¬cients depend upon the seasonâthese are called periodic Autoregressive-Moving average models, or PARMA. Salas and Obeysekera (1992), Salas and Fernandez (1993), and Claps et al. (1993) discuss the conceptual basis of such stochastic streamflow models. For example, Salas and Obeysekera (1992) found that low-order PARMA models, such as a PARMA(2,1), arise from reasonable conceptual representations of persistence in rainfall, runoff, and groundwater recharge and release. Claps et al. (1993, p. 2553) observe that the PARMA(2, 2) model which may be needed if one wants to preserve year-to-year correlation poses a parameter estimation challenge (see also Rasmussen et al. 1996). The PARMA (1, 1) model is more practical and easy to extend to the multivariate case (Hirsch 1979; Stedinger et al. 1985; Salas 1993; Rasmussen et al. 1996). Experience has shown that PARMA(1, 1) models do a"

As delta regions are particularly sensitive to precipitation and river runoff, outputs from an integrated catchment model (see Chap. 13 and Whitehead et al. 2015a, b) were used to determine run-off and associated nutrient loadings from the delta rivers into the Bay of Bengal. The model took account of both climatic scenarios (Q0, Q8, Q16) and patterns of upstream water use according to three socio-economic scenarios (Less Sustainable (LS), Business As Usual, (BAU), More Sustainable (MS)) scenarios (Whitehead et al. 2015a, b). The results of the Q0-BAU, Q8-LS and Q16-MS were used in further simulations. A regional POLCOMS-ERSEM coupled model (Holt et al. 2009; ButenschÃ¶n et al. 2016) was used to project both the physical state of the ocean (temperature, salinity, currents, light level), as well as the biogeochemistry and plankton production in the Bay of Bengal (see Chap. 14). The model simulates the dynamics of nutrients (C, P, N and Si), phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria, as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter. The model domain covers the entire coastal area of Bangladesh up to 200 km beyond the edge of the continental shelf, with a horizontal resolution of 0.1Â° and 42 vertical levels. For each climate dataset, the model was run continuously for 1971â2099. Outputs from the POLCOMS-ERSEM model were then used to drive a dynamic marine ecosystem model that predicts potential production by size class of fish, taking into account food availability, predation effects and temperature effects on feeding and mortality (Blanchard et al. 2012). Size-based methods like this are useful in that they capture the basic metabolic properties and dynamics of marine food webs, describing energy flux and production by size class, independent of speciesâ ecology (Blanchard et al. 2012). To make specific projections for key species, however, a second model, called SS-DBEM, was used (Fernandes et al. 2013, 2016, 2017), which projects changes in species distribution and abundance over time while explicitly considering changes in production, dispersal and physiology as a result of changing ocean conditions, as well as species interactions (Fernandes et al. 2013). The size-spectrum model was applied to explore potential changes in the total productivity of the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone under both climate change and"

Similarly, if the physical characteristics of a basin will change substantially in the future, the historical streamflow record may not provide reliable estimates of the distribution of future unregulated flows. In the absence of the stationarity of streamflows or a representative historical record, an alternative scheme is to assume that precipitation is a stationary stochastic process and to route either historical or synthetic precipitation sequences through an appropriate rainfall-runoff model of the river basin."
175,1466,0.391,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Surface runoff of precipitation and the need to collect urban wastewater are the primary reasons for designing and maintaining urban drainage systems. Storms are a major source of flow into the system. Even sanitary sewer systems that are designed to be completely separate from storm drainage sewers are often influenced by rainfall through illicit connections or even inï¬ltration. Rainfall varies over time and space. These differences are normally small when considering short time periods and small distances but they increase as time and distance increase. The ability to account for spatial differences in rainfall depends on the size of the catchment area and on the number of functioning rainfall recording points in the catchment. The use of radar permits more precision in estimating precipitation patterns over space and time, as if more rain gauges were used and as if they were monitored more frequently. In practice spatial effects are not measured at high resolution and therefore events where signiï¬cant spatial variations occur, such as in summer thunderstorms, are usually not very accurately represented. There are two categories of rainfall records: recorded (real) events and synthetic (not-real) events. Synthetic rainfall comes in two forms: as stochastically generated rainfall data and as design storms. These events are derived from analyses of actual rainfall data and are used to augment or replace those historical (real) data. Design events are a synthesized set of rainfall proï¬les that have been processed to produce storms with speciï¬c return periods, i.e., how often, on average, one can expect to observe rainfall events of that magnitude or greater. Design events are derived to reduce the number of runs needed to analyze system performance under design flow conditions."

To consider supplementary parameters, hydrological processbased models support understanding of the behaviour of hydrologic systems as a response to climate change. Such models include evapotranspiration, surface runoff, subsurface and interflow, and river channel flow. For HABIT-CHANGE the hydro-ecological model SWIM (Krysanova et al. 2000; Hattermann et al. 2008) was applied. SWIM is a hydrological model at the scale of a catchment area (for details refer to Chap. 3). It integrates relevant hydrological processes to investigate the impacts of climate changes, such as water percolation, groundwater recharge, plant water uptake, soil evaporation, and river routing. SWIM allows the development of scenarios, for example, with a focus on the habitat type, and it provides information relevant to vegetation dynamics, i.e. the available soil water (Holsten et al. 2009). However, model results rely strongly on the quality and the resolution of the input data (like observed runoff, soil and land use data) for the specific investigation area."

Further, the IPCC AR5 called on research communities to work on assessments by modelling on the emission pathway and feasibilities for the global target. Recently, several global emission scenario studies present emission scenarios focusing on the 2-degree target, which requires global emissions to peak by 2020 at the latest (IPCC 2014).

Mean annual temperature data from three stations since 1948 show a significantly increasing trajectory in all four seasons (Fig. 5.2a). Averaged mean daily rainfall figures show no major trend and are generally in the range 8â12 mm/day (Fig. 5.2b) with extreme lows (<5 mm/day) in Khulna in 1971 and 2008â2010 and extreme highs (>45 mm/day) in Barisal in 1955 and 1960, and in Patuakhali in 1983. Monsoon and post-monsoon seasonal rainfall trends generally increased from the mid-1960s to the 1990s followed by sharply declining trends since 2007. There is some evidence for a shift in rainfall from the monsoon to the post-monsoon period after the 1990s, but all seasons show a decline after 2007 (Hossain et al. 2016b). The mean sea level from two coastal sites shows a gradual rise since the 1980s (Fig. 5.2c) threatening the ecosystem services at the coast particularly in concert with cyclones. The doubling in the frequency of severe cyclonic storms over the period 1991â2007 compared to 1960â1990 (Fig. 5.2e) is particularly noteworthy. Crop damage from natural disasters (Fig. 5.2d), including flooding, cyclones and waterlogging, since 1963 shows recorded damage in 35 per cent of the years with three clusters around 1963â1969, 1981â1991 and 2006â2009.

Statistical downscaling employs statistical relationships between large-scale variables (predictors) and smaller scale ï¬elds (predictands) such that, for example, robust changes in predictors as simulated by climate models can be used to estimate change in the predictands, assuming that the observation-based statistical relations themselves are stable under climate change. Predictors are frequently chosen as atmospheric ï¬elds, whereas predictands can be atmospheric, oceanic or related to ice. In this respect, a decision was made to include a review of publications on statistical downscaling even though the predictands may not be atmospheric."

If climatic variables are included among the environmental data, these models offer the potential to coarsely predict how species distributions may shift in response to global climate change (e.g., Bush et al. 2014a)."

The scavenging coefficient, on the other hand, showed a substantial effect on the release rate estimation. A three times larger scavenging coefficient resulted in increases of 10 and 21 fold in the estimated release rate for 131I and 137Cs, respectively, at maximum. The uncertainties of the release rate estimated by the inverse method might be large when the plume is transported through the rainfall area. It can be suggested that a more realistic parameterization of wet deposition processes is needed to refine the release rate estimation from environmental data.

In this study, the MARCS model with the regional parameterization scheme was used to calculate the parameters of the SFDR PDFs over the Russian Arctic. However, the additional algorithms should be implemented to the model before developing regional-oriented schemes for the catchments located in the mid-latitudes. As the role of evaporation is more important in the general water balance on the south regions, this variable has to be considered (Kovalenko and Gaidukova 2011). In this study, the MARCS model was forced by the outputs from the climate model with big spatial resolution, which is usually cause the challenges in the physically-based spatially distributed hydrological models. However, it seems to not be a big issue for the hydrological models such as the MARCS model. The physical core of the model is a lumped model in form of a linear filter with stochastic components (see Kovalenko 1993 for details). The role of spatial resolution in the datasets used to force the MARCS model and the options connected with the regional climate projections can be issues for future studies. The vision for the future is changing continuously, and the set of climate change scenarios is renewed almost every 5 years since the meteorological models are improving unceasingly. The feature of the MARCS model is its general simplicity (only the projected statistics are evaluated instead of a time series), and is easy to perform for a regional scale assessment of the future water availability not only for an mean runoff value, but also for outliers (i.e for extreme hydrological events) under any chosen climate projection. These outliers are important for economists since they are usually the ones dealing with risks associated with weather/runoff extremes. The methods to evaluate the economic values from the outputs of the MARCS hydrological models are the topic of the future studies.

Greater percolation to depth should increase ANPP by reducing the frequency or duration of periods during which soil water content remains below the lower stress threshold. Consistent with the soil water bucket model, it was found that delivering the same total of precipitation as fewer, but larger events increased ANPP by 30 % in semiarid shortgrass steppe, but decreased ANPP by 10â18 % in tallgrass prairie (Knapp et al. 2002; Heisler-White et al. 2009). Corollary 3 Precipitation regulates the response of productivity to CO2 but not to warming. The ANPP response to CO2 varies as a function of precipitation when considered across ecosystems. The ANPP-CO2 response peaks at âmoderateâ levels of annual precipitation (300â400 mm) across desert and grassland ecosystems (Fig. 7.5; Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b). Productivity responds relatively little to CO2 when precipitation is very low because water stress inhibits growth and may contribute to plant senescence and mortality if it becomes sufficiently severe. The benefits of elevated CO2 on productivity are reduced when annual precipitation is >400 mm partly because the efficient use of water use is no longer a critical variable (Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b). Therefore, the average across-ecosystem response of NPP to CO2 likely will be greatest in systems in which NPP is or will become moderately water limited (Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b, 2011; Webb et al. 2012)."

In other words, the climate (particularly a climate extreme) changes dramatically, even if the mean stays the same. The change need not be symmetric: Hot may change more than cold (or vice versa). Figure 1.3c is not a symmetric distribution. The key is to see climate as the distribution, not as a ï¬xed number (often the mean). This brings us to the fundamental difference between weather and climate forecasting. In weather forecasting,2 we need to know the current state of the system and have a model for projecting it forward. Often the model can be simple. One âmodelâ we all use is called persistence: What is the weather now? It may be like that tomorrow. In many places (e.g., Hawaii), such a model is not bad, but sometimes it is horribly wrong (e.g., when a hurricane hits Hawaii). So we try to use more sophisticated models, now typically numerical ones. These models go by the name numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and they are used to âforecastâ the evolution of the earth system from its current state.

The ordered probit model assumes that a latent variable (not explicitly modeled above) underlying the state of land degradation is normally distributed, while the effects of the independent variables on the ordered outcomes are restricted to be monotonous. The coefï¬cients are then estimated via the maximum likelihood (ML) method.

365,534,0.381,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The AgMIP RIA methods are designed to assess vulnerability of farm households to climate change. We define a climate as a probability distribution of weather events that occur at a specific place and during a defined period of time. A change in climate is a change in the probability distribution of weather events. These changes are often described in terms of the mean temperature over a period of time such as a day, month or year, but can also be changes in temperature extremes, the variability of weather events, and other aspects such as rainfall amount and intensity and wind velocity. Impacts of climate change are quantified as gains and losses in economic wellbeing (e.g., farm income or per capita income) or other metrics of well-being (e.g., changes in health or environmental quality). In this framework, some or all individuals may gain or lose from a change, and we say the losers are vulnerable to loss from climate change. The AgMIP RIA methodology is designed to quantify the proportion of the population that are losers, as well as the magnitude of loss. It is important to note, however, that in a heterogeneous population there are typically some gainers and some losers, and thus the net impact may be positive or negative. The AgMIP RIA method is designed to quantify climate vulnerability by modeling a heterogeneous population of farm households rather than modeling a ârepresentativeâ or average or typical farm. This approach begins with the representation of impacts on the farm household using the concept of economic gains and losses (other metrics of impact can be also be used depending on available data, e.g., the impact on health of household members). As Fig. 3 shows, the AgMIP RIA approach uses a statistical representation of the farming system in a heterogeneous region or population to quantify the distribution of gains and losses, e.g., due to climate change. Figure 4 illustrates this idea with two loss distributions. The area under the distribution on the positive side of zero is the proportion of losers and is the measure"
214,480,0.38,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"The key to using climate model output is understanding the credibility of the model, the legitimacy of the model, and the salience or relevance of the projection. Credibility comes from the type of model and the model development process. Legitimacy comes from a detailed understanding of uncertainty in all its dimensions for a particular problem. Salience (relevance) comes from understanding of a particular problem. Climate model output must be made relevant, and having translators or interpreters familiar with a particular application has been effective in many cases. Climate information in many cases is just one dimension of a problem, and it may not be the dominant dimension of uncertainty, particularly where the human sphere is involved. It may matter more how society changes than how climate changes to determine the load on a particular resource (e.g., water, land). So climate model output must be put into perspective, and uncertainty assessed against particular problems to determine salience. The use of interpreters and a focus on salience allows the dimensions of uncertainty to be reduced. These dimensions are different for particular problems. The prediction problem determines the timescale, and that determines the balance of scenario, initial condition, and model uncertainty. It may also help determine how to construct an ensemble of models for a particular problem. And the particular impacts determine what portions of model uncertainty are most important. Examples of particular aspects of model performance include intense summer convective precipitation over a region, or a particular mode of climate variability like tropical cyclones, the Asian monsoon, or blocking events. Focusing on a particular process allows a better assessment of uncertainty in a particular model, or an ensemble of models. This can be done with speciï¬c observations. It also helps to ï¬t the model output into a particular problem, and getting the particular data on the right spatial and time scales. We hope that this approach is useful in helping to frame the problem of assessment and use of climate models from broad uncertainties to speciï¬c and more tractable uncertainties. These uncertainties can be qualitative or, when narrowed sufï¬ciently, even made quantitative. For most problems, if framed in this way, it is not necessary to wait to use a future model with reduced uncertainty, and the âbestâ model or set of models may be different for different processes. Climate models provide a wealth of salient information that is ready to be interpreted and assessed to make speciï¬c projections."

The climate scenarios assume the same current yield trends but with changes in climate predicted by GCMs. Because maximum temperature is found to be strongly positively related to higher yields, future yields are predicted to be higher, on average, under climate change. This is likely a result of insufficient observations needed to estimate the historical relationship accurately. Here we find the benefits from rising maximum temperatures outweigh the negatives from rising minimum temperature. In other cases we have found the opposite to be true (Fig. 5)."

We often use the word prediction, but we really mean projection. A prediction implies something will happen with some probability. A forecast is a prediction. There are multiple possible climate pathways, subject to several types of uncertainty. On long time and large space scales, the scenario uncertainty dominates (see Chap. 10).

(2007) found only a 1 % increase in net global DMS concentrations upon a 50 % increase in atmospheric CO2; Cameron-Smith and co-workers simulated a 50 % increase in DMS flux to the atmosphere over large regions of the Southern Ocean when atmospheric CO2 increases to 970 ppm (Cameron-Smith et al. 2011). The latter result was related to concurrent sea-ice changes and ocean ecosystem composition shifts. In a comparison with previous model outcomes, the authors concluded that increasing model complexity appears to be associated with reduced DMS emission at the equator and increased emissions at high latitudes. The variation in model outcomes illustrates how important it is to improve our understanding of the underlying ecosystem processes. The different scenarios presented in Fig. 1.1 show that under different environmental conditions the DMS yield from DMSP can shift by possibly an order of magnitude. This can potentially result in changes in DMS emission of several hundreds of percent, an extent that the recent publication from Quinn and Bates (2011), which argues for the retirement of the CLAW hypothesis (see Sect. 1.2.3.2), did not consider possible. Whether such shifts are plausible at the global scale remains to be seen. Since DMS in mechanistic models is dynamically linked to the production of DMSP by phytoplankton, validating this model parameter would help us to understand the underlying controlling factors. Building a DMSP database comparable to the current DMS database would therefore be of great value."

The Gantt et al. (2011) parameterisation yields a more accurate representation of the seasonal cycle of marine organic aerosol mass concentrations than Vignati et al. (2010).

241,607,0.376,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"to the extent of change in these environmental variables, predicting the future climate requires reliable estimates of the future composition of the atmosphere and land use. As the concentration of GHGs and aerosols in the future atmosphere is so difï¬cult to predict because of the many influencing factors, scenarios are developed based on projections of the future evolution of the world population and economy (see Chap. 11, Sect. 11.2) and it is these scenarios that are used as the basis for projections of future climate. Beside the uncertainty related to the limited information on land use, and the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aerosols, there are also other sources of uncertainty in models. These include limited amounts of input data and their limited accuracy. Due to the chaotic nature of the climate system, a very small difference in initial conditions can generate different climate features, as each simulation generates a different set of realisations. If this were the only source of uncertainty, the differences between simulations should remain within the range of typical climate variability. However, this is not the case. Many sub-grid-scale processes must be simulated in models in a more or less complex form and are not well described by the models. For example, simulations of cloud formation, their optical and radiative features, and the creation of precipitation still carry considerable model error. For climate models to be useful, they need to be evaluated. As future climate predictions cannot be evaluated by direct comparison with observations, models are evaluated by comparing simulations with observations of the past climate. In theory, this should make it possible to select the best model, but this is not the case in practice. One model can usually describe a particular parameter better than another model, while the second model better describes a different variable or even the same variable, but in another part of the world. There are no objective ways to choose the best model, because none are able to exactly reproduce the observed mean climate and its variability. Differences between simulations and real climate data can be estimated on the basis of a so-called reference period (in the past) for which observational data are available. The differences, usually referred to as âbiasesâ, vary in space and typically also in daily and annual cycles. The models describe climate at a set of grid points. Because of numerical constraints in GCMs and RCMs, model results at neighbouring grid points are more correlated than actual measurements from two observation points at the same distance (DÃ©quÃ© 2007). This is one reason why the distributions of simulated variables are usually smoothed in comparison with measured station data. Simulations tend to underestimate the highest values and overestimate the lowest (DÃ©quÃ© 2007). This means that the bias is different in different parts of the distribution."

Nevertheless, the models he cites have a range of DMS flux estimates, from 10.7 to 27.9 Tg(S) year 1, which is roughly within the range of the bottom-up estimates given above.

87,816,0.374,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","2013; Zessner et al. 2017) and is described below as an example of the functions of biophysical models. Examples of Ecological and Biophysical Models EPIC (Environmental Policy and Integrated Climate) was originally developed at the US Department of Agriculture to study the effect of agricultural production on erosion and soil productivity. Since its creation, it has been further developed by several research institutes into a comprehensive terrestrial ecosystem model for simulating numerous ecosystem processes that can also take a wide range of land-use management options into account (e.g. tillage, harvest, fertilization, irrigation, drainage, liming, burning, and pesticide application). The main components in EPIC are crop growth, weather simulation, hydrology, nutrient and carbon cycling, soil temperature and moisture, soil erosion, tillage, and plant environment control (Izaurralde et al. 2012; BalkovicÌ et al. 2013). When combined with economic models or model networks to assess agricultural and forestry biomass production, EPIC can be used to address two major research questions: the effect of changing environmental conditions on biomass production, e.g. forecast crop yields impacted by climate change ((Kraxner et al. 2013; Kirchner et al. 2015), and the impacts of different management options for biomass production on the environment, e.g. erosion, nitrogen leaching, or soilborne greenhouse gas emissions (Schwarz-v. Raumer et al. 2017). The soil-crop model CERES-EGC functions in a similar way to EPIC. It has been used for more than 20 years to investigate the environmental effects of crop cultivation such as nitrate leaching, soil greenhouse gas emissions, and ammonia and nitrogen oxides (Durandeau et al. 2010). CERES-EGC can also be used to predict yields of the most important agricultural crops (Mavromatis 2016). Both models can be used at field and regional scales.

He demonstrated the model using simulated as well as TOEFL iBT data. Xu (2007) studied monotonicity properties of the GD model and found that, like the GPC model, monotonicity obtains when slope parameters are restricted to be equal, but does not when this restriction is relaxed, although model fit is improved. She pointed out that trade offs between these two variants of the model should be considerred in practice. M. von Davier (2007) extended the GD model to a hierarchical model and further extended it to the mixture general diagnostic (MGD) model (2008b), which allows for estimation of diagnostic models in multiple known populations as well as discrete unknown, or not directly observed mixtures of populations. Xu and von Davier (2006) used a MIRT model specified in the GD model framework with NAEP data and verified that the model could satisfactorily recover parameters from a sparse data matrix and could estimate group characteristics for large survey data. Results under both single and multiple group assumptions and comparison with the NAEP model results were also presented. The authors suggested that it is possible to conduct cognitive diagnosis for NAEP proficiency data. Xu and von Davier (2008b) extended the GD model, employing a log-linear model to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated in the latent skill distribution. They extended that model (2008a) to allow comparison of constrained versus nonconstrained parameters across multiple populations, illustrating with NAEP data. M. von Davier et al. (2008) discussed models for diagnosis that combine features of MIRT, FA, and LC models. Hartz and Roussos (2008)7 wrote on the fusion model for skills diagnosis, indicating that the development of the model produced advancements in modeling, parameter estimation, model fitting methods, and model fit evaluation procedures. Simulation studies demonstrated the accuracy of the estimation procedure, and effectiveness of model fitting and model fit evaluation procedures. They concluded that the model is a promising tool for skills diagnosis that merits further research and development. Linking and equating also continue to be important topics of ETS research. In this section the focus is research on IRT-based linking/equating methods. M. von Davier and von Davier (2007, 2011) presented a unified approach to IRT scale linking and transformation. Any linking procedure is viewed as a restriction on the item parameter space, and then rewriting the log-likelihood function together with implementation of a maximization procedure under linear or nonlinear restrictions accomplishes the linking. Xu and von Davier (2008c) developed an IRT linking approach for use with the GD model and applied the proposed approach to NAEP data. Holland and Hoskens (2002) developed an approach viewing CTT as a firstorder version of IRT and the latter as detailed elaborations of CTT, deriving general results for the prediction of true scores from observed scores, leading to a new view"

These floods occur during the monsoon season, when the three types of flooding can occur simultaneously, although the relative severity depends on location. Generally tidal flooding occurs close to the coast, whereas fluvial flooding occurs further inland along the rivers and estuaries. Where fluvial flooding is influenced by the tide, the flood is characterised as a compound fluvio-tidal flood (Chap. 8). To analyse the extent of flooding in the region, a well-known opensource numerical model (Delft 3D Flow) was applied. In the model, the study region is represented by all the rivers and estuaries of the coastal zone which have a width greater than 100 m. Fluvial flows enter the model domain through three major riversâGanges, Brahmaputra and Upper Meghna (see Chap. 8, Fig. 8.1). For all present-day conditions simulated by the model, measured discharges from the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) are specified in these three locations, whereas, for all future scenarios, discharges in these locations are provided from the simulation results of the hydrological model, INCA (Whitehead et al. 2015a, b; see Chap. 13).

These municipalities were recognized as the most vulnerable to floods, torrential floods and landslides by the UNDP Ofï¬ce in Serbia during the post-disaster phase after the May 2014 event. Four municipalities were excluded from IPL 210 Project activities because no landslides occurred during the May 2014 rainfall episode; there was only flood damage. The geological and geomorphological settings are very complex, as well as other environmental conditions in such a wide area. The type of movement and type of material involved (Cruden and VanDine 2013) were dependent on lithological type, local geomorphological characteristics, engineering geological properties, degree and depth of weathering substratum, as well as the amount of precipitation received during the May 2014 event."

The most important month of the growing season is usually reproduction, and therefore the influence of this period has a strong relationship to yield. The benefit of the interactive term is multifold. Specifically, linear statistical models tend to be meancentric, which means they are challenged to capture extreme events. The quadratic component of their interaction generally captures these extreme events in the model. The models are generally run at the district level. Moreover, each country is unique in the way that it reports yield data. The spatial resolution of the yield data provided by a country serves as the basis of calibration in the model. Both deviation from expected yield and actual yield prediction are presented in the findings of the report. The expected yield has been trended to account for linear improvement of seed stock and improved agricultural practices. These trends are removed, since they are independent of the weather. An example report or the corn belt of the USA during the 2015 growing season is presented below. Figure 3a shows the predicted deviation from trended (expected) corn yields for the center of the corn-belt in the United States at the end of August 2015. The reasons this region is chosen are twofold; it produces one of the highest yields and is one of the most important growing areas for corn in the world and the sophisticated procedure for calculating yield by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides one of the best data sets for calibrating the yield prediction"

By its very nature, the interaction of weather-related and climate hazards with exposed and vulnerable individuals and communities around the globe should not be neglected. For example, from the year 2005 to 2014, although this data is not complete, it was determined that approximately 700,000 people died, 1.7 billion inhabitants were affected, and economic losses mounted $1.4 trillion in disasters worldwide (UNFAO 2015).

Even though models predict a slight increase in precipitation (about 20 mm/day), the number of dry days (<1 mm/day) per vegetation season is expected to increase by 4â5 days. When combining these models the predicted beginning of the vegetation period will shift from 22nd February (1971â2000) to 27th January (2036â2065). Additionally, the predicted water balance, calculated as the mean precipitation minus the potential evapotranspiration, is expected to decrease slightly in autumn. Global-warming-related effects on biodiversity can be mitigated in the short term by designing an appropriate nature reserve (Botkin et al. 2007). However, the challenges of biodiversity loss are daunting, since biodiversity is decreasing even in protected areas. For this reason, alien invasive species found in the Mediterranean, even if not highly invasive, like A. squamatus, might nevertheless potentially become so. In Fig. 19.3 we can recognise the distribution of A. squamatus in areas adjacent to both protected areas of SecÌovlje Salina and SÌkocjanski Inlet. As previously noted, in some years like in 2008 the abundance of A. squamatus increased (GlasnovicÌ and FisÌer PecÌnikar 2010). Our analysis of temperature showed a highly increased mean annual temperature the previous year 2007 (Fig. 19.4), which resulted in a prolonged vegetation period and must have resulted in high seed production as well. To prevent a potential invasion by A. squamatus plants should be removed before reaching the height of 110 cm to prevent or at least minimise seed production, since smaller plants have more than five times fewer flower heads (Fig. 19.2), even though the number of seeds in a single flower head is more or less the same. Calculation show that plants smaller than 110 cm could bear from about 700 to 8,700 seeds, while plants taller than 110 cm produce at least five times more seeds from about 47,000 to 70,000 seeds. Obviously, it is necessary to constrain eventual accumulation of seeds in the soil seed bank and to prevent plants from forming a reservoir for future invasions if appropriate conditions might recur."
10,247,0.373,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"(Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant) 1-dimensional soil moisture models were implemented. Through these models, the effect of soil and crop type, and drought severity and time of occurrence during the year on the eventual impacts of the drought can be highlighted. Further development of these models and expanding the modelled area can support the development of drought adaptation and mitigation policy in Flanders. During the development of drought indicators and models for Flanders, a data and information gap concerning soil moisture, a key variable in drought monitoring and impact assessment, became apparent. Therefore, a soil moisture measuring campaign was set up, in which 15 traditional soil moisture probes and two innovative area-integrated soil moisture probes (COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System; Zreda et al. 2012) were installed in the modelled catchments. In addition, the use of the Soil Water Index (SWI; COPERNICUS 2015) based on remotely sensed soil moisture data was tested in combination with ground measurements. The results of this study were used in the development of a Flemish soil moisture network, for which the probes will be relocated to locations distributed throughout Flanders to assure an optimal assessment of soil moisture conditions throughout the region in combination with satellite imagery."

Also climate models predicted that precipitation will shift from the north to the south (Boonyawat and Chiwanno 2007). Based on climate data generated by a global circulation model temperature in Thailand projected to increase 2Â° Câ4 Â°C by the end of the century (ADB 2009). Jesdapipat (2008) stated that storms in Thailand have become more intense which is consistent with the subjective perceptions of respondents in our sample. In Vietnam it has been predicted that most regions will experience an increase in temperature of 2Â° Câ4 Â°C by the end of the century (Cuong 2008). The same author also found that in most areas of Vietnam, overall rainfall intensity has increased considerably while monthly rainfall has decreased between the months of July and August, but has increased between September and November. It is also expected that the Southern part of Vietnam will become drier. In Table 3, we illustrate the perceived impact of climate change by farmers on the performance of agriculture, in particular in crop production and their adaptation measures. It is striking that in all six provinces of the two countries a considerable share of households reports a decline in yields. The highest shares with over 60% of households reporting are in Buri Ram and Dak Lak, both provinces with a strong agricultural potential. In these two provinces the occurrence of drought stress was most frequent which is quite consistent with their observations on the change in climate generally and in rainfall reported in Table 2. In spite of the high share of households who report an impact on crop production only between one fourth and two fifth undertake adaptation measures.

221,160,0.37,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Within the climate change framework, there is a gap between modelling analyses and policy development, and whether national climate policy incorporates such modelling analyses depends on several factors.

Through discussion with the climate change focal point and related agencies, Thailand succeeded in reflecting the modelling analysis in actual policy development. Thailandâs scenario studies on Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) and NAMA roadmap development have been highly successful.

214,274,0.37,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Climate observations and climate projections provide a background for discussion. Essential in the application was evaluation of local weather processes and whether or not models represented these processes. This helped to develop trust of the expert guidance to interpret model information. Attention is naturally drawn to recent extreme events and whether or not these extremes are consistent with projections, for example, more precipitation occurring in extreme events. Warm and dry spells in the winter and spring that alter greening of forests, followed by damaging cold, is another example. Convolution of climate, extreme events, and ecological responses sit at the foundation of plausible futures. For example, if there is large-scale disruption offorests by drought, ï¬re, or wind that leads to the death of many trees, then the future forest will be recovering in a much different mean climate than in which it originally evolved. Since Isle Royaleâs forests are at the southern extent of the subarctic (or boreal) forest, and that extent may well move northward in a warmer climate, it is unlikely that a boreal forest disrupted by drought, ï¬re, or wind will be regenerated. Given the importance of speciï¬c tree species to moose food supply, this would be a negative indicator for moose populations. Evaluation of the combined influence of climate drivers was largely negative for maintaining the wolf-moose ecosystem. Though climate change is only part of the portfolio of factors in the decision-making package, it demonstrates that in the future it will be even more difï¬cult to sustain this precarious ecosystem. A driving conclusion from this exercise is the need to plan for best possible futures rather than manage toward preservation or conservation of the past."

Greenhouse gas emissions occur from natural sources, and these can be projected forward, but they also come from human emissions. How do we know what they will be? That requires coming up with estimates of the future evolution of the climate system forcing, and this is done with scenarios. Scenarios are used to specify uncertain future inputs. When models are run with forcing from these scenarios, the results are not forecasts, but projections of the future, given assumptions about what might happen. The key is that the assumptions that impact the projection are outside of the realm of the model. Most climate models do not try to predict the human emissions of greenhouse gases. Integrated assessment models however (see Chaps. 7 and 8) try to predict human emissions. But these models also depend on scenarios. An integrated assessment model may generate emissions from economic activity, but even that is dependent on a scenario, of population growth, for example. The common method is to have a series of projections spanning what we think are the possible states. For current climate models, it is common to have several scenarios of future emissions of different gases, based on assumptions about human systems, for example, economic growth and development. Each scenario used to force a climate model results in a projection. It is not really a forecast. The range of possible outcomes (projections from probable scenarios) are broadly the forecast: what we think will happen. So mostly we are considering climate projections of the future dependent on speciï¬c assumptions (scenarios) about what might happen. It is important in using models to be clear about what is imposed by scenarios and what the model is calculating. Otherwise, you might end up comparing two model projections that are different because of scenario differences, not model differences."

As with the atmosphere, there are several types of ocean models. We concern ourselves mostly with ocean general circulation models (GCMs), which are similar to GCMs for the atmosphere. Ocean GCMs have complex representations of the ocean circulation throughout its depth, full ocean topography, and parameterizations for small-scale mixing processes at the surface and within the ocean. Beyond the full representation of the ocean structure in Fig. 6.1 are simpler types of ocean models. These models try to represent individual ocean basins or just regions of those ocean basins (Fig. 6.2). As with models of the atmosphere, they are often called regional models. Basin-scale regional models may be used for experiments that look at coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere. Regional ocean models are similar to limited area atmosphere models discussed in Chap. 5: They are often used at high resolution, coupled to limited area atmosphere models to represent details of regional weather or climate. They are forced at their boundaries by observations or by output from other models. These regional models may not include a deep ocean circulation. The deep ocean circulation is often speciï¬ed in regional ocean models. Regional ocean models are designed primarily to represent the region above the thermocline that changes relatively quickly and responds to the surface climate system.

222,322,0.368,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"11.2 Climate of Bangladesh Bangladesh is widely recognised as being vulnerable to extreme weather events and climate change. A large proportion of the countryâs topography is low-lying and forms the delta of the GBM rivers (Karim and Mimura 2008). The country is densely populated and socio-economically challenged with agriculture playing a significant role in livelihoods. Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate, and this brings high temperature, heavy rainfall, high humidity and strong seasonal variations. Changes in precipitation can lead to enhanced flooding or drought as well as dislocation between the timing of rainfall and the agricultural calendar. Seasons can be separated into four groups, differentiated by the percentage of the mean annual rainfall falling in each season (Islam and Uyeda 2005): â¢ Pre-monsoon (MarchâMay) ~20 per cent â¢ Monsoon (JuneâSeptember) ~62.5 per cent â¢ Post-monsoon (OctoberâNovember) ~15.5 per cent â¢ Winter (DecemberâFebruary) ~2 per cent These estimates vary between studies, and post-monsoon rainfall in particular can be affected by the impacts of cyclones, but the bulk of annual rainfall occurs during the summer monsoon, with some studies reporting higher proportions of up to 70â80 per cent of the annual total (Shahid 2010a). Winter generally sees much cooler and drier conditions and accounts for only two to four per cent of annual rainfall totals. Tropical cyclones are a particular weather-related hazard for Bangladesh, and can bring periods of intense rainfall, particularly during the postmonsoon season. Studies that have examined observed climate changes over Bangladesh show that during the twentieth century annual mean temperatures increased by around 0.5 Â°C (Immerzeel 2008) and were accompanied by increasing rainfall (Shahid 2010b). Sea-level rise and storm surges associated with tropical cyclones are key risks for this region.

In the southern parts of the Baltic Sea basin, tree growth is strongly water limited (Lasch et al. 2002, 2005). Here, an increase in temperature but without an increase in precipitation could further exacerbate the water deï¬cit and thus decrease growth. In general, the temperature response optimum (the ability of tree species to manage higher temperatures) is higher and the effect of rising temperature is more positive, if precipitation also increases, whereas the main effect of higher temperatures is negative and the temperature response optimum lower if precipitation is reduced (Lindner et al. 2010). For example, growth of Norway spruce in the southern boreal zone is projected to increase up to 2050, but then decline due to more frequent dry spells during the growing season (KellomÃ¤ki et al. 2008; Ge et al. 2011b; see also Chap. 16).

175,645,0.366,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","when this assumption may be reasonable. Often a more sophisticated multi-scaling model is appropriate (Gupta and Dawdy 1995a; Robinson and Sivapalan 1997). Generally the mean is employed as the index flood. The problem of estimating the pth quantile xp is then reduced to estimating the mean for a site Âµx, and the ratio xp/Âµx of the pth quantile to the mean. The mean can often be estimated adequately with the record available at a site, even if that record is short. The indicated ratio is estimated using regional information. The British Flood Studies Report (NERC 1975) calls these normalized flood distributions growth curves. Key to the success of the index-flood approach is identiï¬cation of sets of basins that have similar coefï¬cients of variation and skew. Basins can be grouped geographically, as well as by physiographic characteristics including drainage area and elevation. Regions need not be geographically contiguous. Each site can potentially be assigned its own unique region consisting of sites with which it is particularly similar (Zrinji and Burn 1994), or regional regression equations can be derived to compute normalized regional quantiles as a function of a siteâs physiographic characteristics and other statistics (Fill and Stedinger 1998). Clearly the next step for regionalization procedures, such as the index-flood method, is to move away from estimates of regional parameters that do not depend upon basin size and other physiographic parameters. Gupta et al. (1994) argue that the basic premise of the index-flood method, that the coefï¬cient of variation of floods is relatively constant, is inconsistent with the known relationships between the coefï¬cient of variation CV and drainage area (see also Robinson and Sivapalan 1997). Recently, Fill and Stedinger (1998) built such a relationship into an index-flood procedure using a regression model to explain variations in the normalized quantiles. Tasker and Stedinger (1986) illustrated how one might relate log-space skew to physiographic basin characteristics (see also Gupta and Dawdy 1995b). Madsen and Rosbjerg (1997b) did the same for a regional model of Îº for the"

In this regard, temporal variability of precipitation and flood dynamics were analysed in order to search for possible trends that can be brought about by climate change. Analysis of precipitation in the Biebrza Valley was done on the basis of data recorded in rain gauges located in Laskowiec (1996â2011 dataset) and Burzyn (1970â2010) (see location on the Fig. 14.1). Flood analysis was done on the basis of discharge data for the River Biebrza in Osowiec in the years 1951â2011. The flood threshold of river discharge (bankful flow) was set up on the basis of multi-year observations as 25 m3/s (Grygoruk et al. 2011b). Also the largest floods (over the threshold of the median of the highest annual discharges of Biebrza in Osowiec: Q > 84.1 m3/s, which is a flood of 50 % exceedence frequency) were analysed in order to reveal the temporal dynamics of flooding in particular seasons. Those sizeable floods are important from an ecological point of view, as they cover a large extent of the valley and induce the development and function of riparian zones as well as a network of ox-bow lakes, entailing water exchange between the river and a large share of the floodplain. Temporal variability in amounts of precipitation recorded in the Burzyn rain gauge during hydrological âsummerâ (MayâOctober) and âwinterâ (NovemberâApril) was analysed for each particular year (Fig. 14.2a), as well as the ratio of winter to summer precipitation (Fig. 14.2b). A slightly decreasing trend in summer volumes of precipitation within the years 1970â2010 can be observed, along with the considerable trend in increasing winter precipitation. One can conclude that the share of precipitation in the cold part of the year increases in the total amount of annual precipitation. However, a vast increase in rainfall intensity in the summer can be observed (Fig. 14.2c) â although in general summers seem to be drier, the increasing temporal concentration of precipitation entails possible flooding and remains a challenge for management and ecosystems. This observation confirms the results of Liszewska and Osuch (2000), who stated that more extreme weather conditions can occur as a major consequence of climate change in Central Europe. Similar results for the analysis of precipitation data recorded in the climate monitoring station of the IMGW (Institute of Meteorology and Water Management) in BiaÅystok (50 km from the Biebrza Valley), in the years 1971â2010, were observed by Grygoruk et al. (2011a). Hence, the precipitation dynamics and their temporal distribution analysed herein on the basis of data from the Laskowiec and Burzyn rain gauges most likely reflect the long-term regional trend. The increasing temporal concentration and intensity of summer sums of rainfall correspond with the results of temporal analysis of the largest floods (Fig. 14.2e). It indicates a significant increase in summer flooding in the first decade of the twentyfirst century, compared to the second half of the twentieth century. Also, the total volume of individual summer floods (calculated as the amount of water momentary stored in the Lower Biebrza Basin during the flood events; Fig. 14.2f) increased in the last 15 years. Temporal analysis of snowmelt floods in the Biebrza Valley (Fig. 14.2d) indicates the continuing trend of the earlier occurrences of floods in 1950â2012. The analysis of the start of the spring flood was emphasised since this process induces the ecosystem services of marshes, such as their role in strictly temporal fish spawning and nutrient removal (Okruszko et al. 2011). It was"

The complexity of the aerosolâcloudâclimate interaction causes large uncertainty in the projections of future climate. Results from different modelling studies on the European region are presented, and these show that the large spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric aerosol concentrations and properties have large regional differences in their effect on climate.

The problem is that even with a few member ensembles, sampling uncertainty is still far from negligible, particularly in weak signal-to-noise situations such as the analysis of the response to solar forcing (Allen and Stott 2002). Therefore, the regression model (Eq. 1) is extended by an additional error term ui that accounts for internal variability in the response patterns. Thus, the simple statistical model (Eq. 1) is replaced by:"
320,59,0.363,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Along with the increasing world population and the technological advancement during the last centuries both energy consumption and the demand for land have increased simultaneously. Climate change at its estimated pace poses serious challenges for society, policy, and the economy. In order to develop suitable strategies for adaptation, fundamental knowledge about the climate in the past, present, and potentially in the future is required on a global and a regional scale. Thus, a scientific assessment of observed and projected changes of climate variables and indices is an inevitable precondition for appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures. Because the terms âweatherâ and âclimateâ are often misunderstood, a few general definitions have to be explained first. While âweatherâ means the state of the atmosphere in a certain moment, hour, day, or week, âclimateâ is defined as the statistical description of weather, including averages and variability as well as the return intervals of extremes over a period of at least 30 years [defined by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)] (WMO 2011). The most relevant climate parameters characterising this period are surface variables- air temperature, precipitation, radiation, humidity, cloud cover and wind. Closely related to this definition I.

In the Food Security recommendations of the Rio + 20 Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Development, held as a preparatory scientiï¬c meeting to the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, one of the recommendations states that scientists need âTo understand fully how to measure, assess and reduce the impacts of production on the natural environment including climate change, recognising that different measures of impact (e.g. water, land, biodiversity, carbon and other greenhouse gases, etc.) may trade-off against each otherâ¦â. The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) is leading a consortium of international scientiï¬c unions to examine weather, climate and food security (WeatCliFS) as well as to look at the interaction of food security and geophysical phenomena. The following fundamental question underpins WeatCliFS: What technologies and methodologies are required to assess the vulnerability of people and places to hazards [such as droughts that lead to famine] â and how might these be used at a variety of spatial and temporal scales?

323,48,0.363,Satellite Earth Observations and Their Impact on Society and Policy,"System of Systems (GEOSS), and a number of other initiatives. The earliest efforts of multilateral coordination in remote sensing were with meteorological satellites. The WWW, the principal activity of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is a cooperative program for collecting, processing, and disseminating meteorological data from satellites and other sources, aiming to maximize the utilization of meteorological data from satellites. The Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) meets annually to coordinate technical standards among satellite operators. Intergovernmental agencies afï¬liated with the UN play a signiï¬cant role in these initiatives for multilateral coordination of Earth observation and research for the protection of the environment. Among these are the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), which studies physical aspects of climate change, and Future Earth, which operates under the auspices of the International Council for Science (ICSU). The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN Educational, Scientiï¬c, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the WMO also help in planning these international research efforts. Funding agencies, such as the International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research (IGFA) and what is now known as the Belmont Forum, also play an important role. To respond to the need for long-term climate monitoring, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established as a user-driven operational system capable of providing the comprehensive observations required for monitoring the climate system; detecting and attributing climate change; assessing impacts of, and supporting adaptation to, climate variability and change; application to national economic development; and research to improve understanding, modeling, and prediction of the climate system (GCOS 2016).6 The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a permanent global system for observations, modeling, and analysis of marine and ocean variables to support operational ocean services worldwide (GOOS 2016). A central purpose of these research programs is to inform and influence national policies and international agreements on environmental management. In the ï¬rst instance, coordination is a matter of avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts and ensuring that there are no gaps in coverage regarding key roles played by satellite observations. At the same time, it is important to agree on rules and procedures (e.g., format standardization, data principles, and sometimes joint program planning), allowing for healthy competition among Earth-observing programs to encourage the flow of innovations that can expand the capacity of space agencies to play constructive roles in dealing with a variety of environmental problems. Coordination is also a matter of linking the contributions of a variety of Earth observation instruments, including ocean buoys, meteorological stations and balloons, seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, remote-sensing satellites, computerized forecasting models, and early warning systems (Group on Earth Observations 2008). For most of the roles identiï¬ed in the preceding section,"

278,222,0.362,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"There is strong consensus among scientists that climate change is upon us and that mitigation action is both worthwhile and urgent (UNFCCC 2011; IPCC 2014a). At the same time, there is widespread recognition that the poverty and inequality in the developing world is unsustainable and there are internationally agreed goals to rectify this (UN 2012). Climate change research has deï¬ned the problem: through measuring and modelling the ï¬ows of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), monitoring extreme weather events, acidiï¬cation of oceans and other observations, the causes and consequences of climate change have been identiï¬ed. We can attribute global climate change to a host of different economic activities with some degree of spatial detail (e.g. Hertwich and Peters 2009; Peters 2010). Current mainstream models for climate change mitigation (CCM) frame the problem predominantly as one of the energy systems and one that is located where energy or emissions are produced or where energy is ï¬nally consumed. They emphasise energy and emissions directly or indirectly associated with activity in different sectors of society (including land use change) â see Fig. 6.1 â but they omit (1) the linkages between energy use sectors through nonenergy resource ï¬ows, (2) the drivers of resource use (e.g. from infrastructure development) and (3) the secondary resource availability (e.g. from infrastructure retirement). Thus, the current mainstream CCM models omit the material boundary conditions of the global system and opportunities for energy and emissions saving through recycling and reuse of materials. When we refer to solutions, we ask: âwhat can we do about climate change?â What are the technical and behavioural responses to the challenge? Analysis of energy and emissions ï¬ows is essential but insufï¬cient to address these questions"

In an AEROCOM exercise involving nine global climate models, Schulz et al. (2006) found a total direct forcing in the range â0.2 Â± 0.2 W mâ2 including a warming by black carbon in the range +0.2 Â± 0.15 W mâ2. These ï¬ndings indicate that the direct effect is relatively small, but Quaas et al. (2008) derived an estimate of the direct effect of â0.9 Â± 0.4 W mâ2 from satellite measurements. However, they recognised the discrepancy and suggested that it may be partly that satellite retrievals of aerosols are not available over bright surfaces such as deserts, snow- or ice-covered surfaces and low-level clouds where the direct forcing may even be positive. They suggested applying a reduction of 30â60 % to the satellitebased estimate, which brings the observations and model results quite close. An important source of uncertainty in the total direct aerosol effect is the uncertainty in relative humidity, spatially and temporally, as atmospheric particles are generally hygroscopic. In measurements of how the atmospheric aerosol increases in size with increasing humidity, it is usually found that a dominating number of the particles is growing by about 30â50 % in diameter; that is, a factor of 2â3 in volume at 90 % relative humidity while scattering increases by a factor of about 3 compared to dry particles (Swietlicki et al. 2008). Growth is increasingly sensitive to relative humidity, for example, increasing humidity from 90 to 95 % results in an additional increase in scattering of roughly 30 % (Zieger et al. 2010). When air pollution spreads to the top of the boundary layer, relative humidity usually increases and particles grow and scatter more light back to space. This strongly affects the aerosol optical depth, which is measured by sun photometers from satellites and on the ground generating an extensive database of observations across the globe that is used to control climate models. Errors in estimates of relative"

Everyone will come to this book with a preconceived deï¬nition of what climate and weather are, but separating these concepts is important for understanding how modeling of climate and weather are similar and why they are different. It also makes sense to discuss what a model is. Even if we do not realize it, we use models all the time. So we describe a few different conceptual types of models and put climate models in context. Finally we introduce the concept of uncertainty. As we discuss later in the book, models may have errors and still be useful, but this requires understanding the errors (the uncertainties) and understanding where they come from. Most of these concepts are common to many types of modeling, and we provide examples throughout the text."

NPP and forage qualityâWarming combined with wetter conditions during the early growing season and elevated CO2 should increase NPP, partly by extending the growing season. Grass production in tallgrass prairie in this region is highly responsive to early-season precipitation (Craine et al. 2012). The anticipated shift to larger, but less frequent precipitation events may reduce ANPP in mesic rangelands (Knapp et al. 2002), but increase ANPP in more arid systems in the region (HeislerWhite et al. 2009). Forage quality may improve, especially if forage benefits of increased early-season precipitation are not negated by effects of late-season dry periods. Livestock productionâThe combination of warmer temperatures, greater precipitation, and CO2 enrichment should increase livestock productivity by moderating winter temperatures (Baker et al. 1993; Eckert et al. 1995; RÃ¶tter and Geijn 1999), lengthening the growing season, and increasing early-season NPP. Wetter growing seasons allow rangeland livestock producers to provide additional watering locations and, perhaps, shift to more heat-tolerant breeds. Vegetation compositionâWarmer temperatures and wetter winter and spring seasons likely will favor plants that grow early in the season."
376,785,0.359,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","example, level of education, household income, and place of residence were described as the main human aspects driving demand for ecosystem services (Yahdjian et al. 2015). The need to consider and incorporate these human-related drivers into our management models far exceeds the utilities of the basic principles of rangeland management as articulated frequently throughout the twentieth century. Land use is a major driver of the array of goods and services that can be supplied, and it is a dynamic feature of landscapes around the world (Foley et al. 2005). Changes in land use can dramatically shift provisions of goods and services, and shifts may signify persistent alterations. Land-use gradients are further complicated by the uncertainties of climate variability and climate change. Though climate models are increasingly sophisticated and generating ânear-termâ projections (Taylor et al. 2012), their limitations and complexities are still problematic. However, recent statistical methods have provided tools to downscale global climate models to spatial scales that have application to land management (Abatzoglou 2013). What is now emerging is a more focused and applicable set of projections of climatic variables and their probabilities that would improve the ability of designing rangeland management that optimizes the provisioning of different ecosystem services under a changing climate. For example, interactive maps for various climate variables for the 2040â2060 period based on global climate models scaled down to the county level are now available for the USA (Fig. 14.7).

233,13,0.359,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"During the last centuries and more dramatically in the last four decades, natural habitats were destroyed at rates much higher than ever observed in human history. All biomes were affected, but those located in tropical regions were more impacted, particularly because policies for the development and appropriation of these territories were emphasized during this period. Nonetheless, the massive transformation of these landscapes to give place to crops and towns multiplied speciesâ losses and vulnerability at incredible rates (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005), mostly due to the fact that most of worldâs biodiversity is concentrated around the tropics (Gaston 2000). In addition to habitat destruction and fragmentation, natural ecosystems were also submitted to high levels of pollution, overexploitation of forestry and ï¬shery resources, invasive species, and to the effects of climate changes mainly provoked by man-induced greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, a high number of species were already extinct and others have suffered severe populations declines (Mace et al. 2005), with many advancing at high speed to higher categories of threat every year (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2010). So, recent scenarios integrating main extinction drivers suggest that rates of extinction are likely to rise by at least a further order of magnitude over the next few centuries (Mace et al. 2005; Pereira et al. 2010; Barnosky et al. 2012; ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2013). This critical situation is now recognized as the âsixth mass extinctionâ, i.e. the sixth period in the history of life in which more than three-quarters of the living species is lost in a short geological interval (Barnosky et al. 2011). Compared to the ï¬rst âbig ï¬veâ, this extinction period has the peculiarity of being caused mainly by the way of living of one single species, the humans. Counteracting this trend is perhaps the biggest ethic, political and scientiï¬c challenge of our times (Sarkar 2005), as the time for action is short, funds for biodiversity conservation are far from below the real needs (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2012), uncertainties are enormous (Forest et al. 2015), and the solution of conï¬icts with main-trend ways-of-living and main patterns of distribution and consumption (e.g., Lenzen et al. 2012) often takes much longer than habitat destruction. In the race to combat extinctions, there is urgency for increasing conservation worldwide. The scientiï¬c community is pressed to provide criteria in order to deï¬ne priorities, as well as for indicating variables and standards that allows for monitoring the evolution of biodiversity in the light of these strategies (Hoffmann et al. 2010; Pereira et al. 2010, 2013; Mace et al. 2010, 2014). Traditionally, biodiversity conservation was based on species counts, valuing sites in terms of species richness, number of endemics and number of threatened species (Myers et al. 2000; Myers 2003; Kier et al. 2009). However, in spite of its generalized use, this kind of data can be very heterogeneous making very difï¬cult comparisons across taxonomic groups, along time and among sites, as species richness can be inï¬uenced by many factors, going from the species concept to the spatial scale and sampling effort (see Gaston 1996 for an overview on this subject). Similarly, in spite of the great interest of Red Lists of speciesâ threats, such as that from IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), to indicate imminent risks of extinction, concentrating conservation-limited resources on threatened species can be very risky and these limits must be considered (Possingham et al. 2002). Moreover, measures based on species counts also have the limitation of considering all species as equals, being"
221,47,0.358,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"In this study we used the linked Integrated Policy Assessment Model of China (IPAC) for the quantitative analysis, which covers both global emission scenario analysis and Chinaâs national emission scenario analysis. IPAC is an integrated model developed by ERI and analyses effects of global, national and regional energy and environment policies. ERI itself has conducted long-term research in developing and utilising energy models since 1992 (Kejun et al. 2009). In order to analyse global emission scenarios and Chinaâs emission scenario, three models are used, one being global and the other two national: the IPACEmission global model, the IPAC-CGE model and the IPAC-AIM/technology model. The three models are linked as shown in Fig. 2.1. The modules in IPAC are currently soft linked, which means the output from one module is used as the input for another. The IPAC-Emission model is a global model within the IPAC family and presently covers nine regions, to be extended to 22. Because this model focuses on energy and land use activities, in order to simulate other gases emissions, the model was revised to cover the analysis for HFC, PHC, SF6, CH4 and N2O. The IPAC-Emission global model is an extended version of the AIM-Linkage model used in IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (Kejun et al. 2000), which links social and economic development, energy activities and land use activities and offers a full range of emission analyses. The IPAC-Emission global model comprises four main parts: (1) society, economy and energy activities module, which mainly analyses demand and supply under conditions of social and economic development and determines energy prices; (2) energy technology module, which analyses the short- and mid-term energy utilisation technologies under different conditions and determines the energy demand under different technology"

An uptake of 1.8  1.0 Pg C year 1 has been obtained by inversion of tropospheric CO2 (Gurney et al. 2004; adjusted by Gruber et al. 2009), while a net ocean sink of 1.9  0.7 Pg C year 1 has been estimated from a surface water CO2 climatology (Takahashi et al. 2009; adjusted by Gruber et al. 2009). Ocean inversion of DIC has given an oceanic CO2 sink of 2.2  0.3 Pg C year 1, (Gruber et al. 2009) and 2.4  0.5 Pg C year 1 has been estimated using ocean biogeochemical models (Watson and Orr 2003).

241,735,0.357,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"For the Baltic Sea area, statistical downscaling methods have mostly been applied to estimate future changes in hydrological variables, such as precipitation and run-off, and storm-related variables such as wind. The usual large-scale predictors are SLP and geopotential height. One particular aspect of the applications of statistical downscaling to the Baltic Sea so far is the frequent use of nonlinear statistical methods, such as weather typing, fuzzy networks and clustering algorithms, whereas for other areas linear regression methods, such as principal component regression, have generally been more frequently found in the literature. Rogutov et al. (2008) gave an example of how a standard statistical downscaling method for precipitation should look. The authors considered the whole of western Europe, but the results are also relevant for the Baltic Sea area. The method used principal components regression, which has been applied not only for downscaling purposes but also for climate reconstructions based on proxy data since mathematically the problem is very similar. Both the predictor (SLP) and the predictand (precipitation) are decomposed by a previous principal component analysis, and the leading components are retained for further analysis. This ensures that the covariance matrices that result in the regression analysis are not singular, avoiding over-ï¬tting of the statistical model. There is no clear rule to determine the optimal number of retained principal components, but the number can be approximately estimated by sensitivity calculations until the skill of the reconstructed predictand, when compared to observed data, does not grow. Linear regression methods produce predictands with the same probability distribution as the predictors. Since atmospheric circulation variables tend to be approximately normally distributed, linear statistical downscaling methods may work well to estimate changes in monthly, seasonal or annual precipitation, which also tend to be approximately normally distributed. However, this is not the case for daily precipitation. In this case, more sophisticated nonlinear methods are needed, for instance those based on classiï¬cation of weather types (see Chap. 10, Sect. 10.3). Wetterhall et al. (2009) employed a classiï¬cation scheme constructed on a fuzzy logic algorithm to estimate changes in daily precipitation over Sweden based on the output of the GCM HadAM3H driven by the SRES scenarios A2 and B2. They also employed a weather generator that takes into account the weather type and is able to replicate the serial autocorrelation of daily precipitation. The advantage of this approach is that it is in theory able to estimate changes not only in daily precipitation amount and occurrence but also in block maxima, that is, maximum 3- or 5-day precipitation. Under these two scenarios, and conditional on the GCM used, Wetterhall et al. (2009) found that precipitation in Sweden tended to increase in the twenty-ï¬rst century and that the maximum 5-day precipitation also became larger"

They also applied the MannâKendall trend test to study changes in annual and seasonal streamflow as well as floods and droughts for three periods: 1920â2005 (68 stations), 1941â2005 (111 stations) and 1961â2000 (151 stations). The overall picture was that trends of increased streamflow dominate annual values and the winter and spring seasons. In all three periods, a signal towards earlier snowmelt floods was clear, as was the tendency towards more severe summer droughts in southern and eastern Norway. The trends in streamflow result from changes in both temperature and precipitation, but the temperatureinduced signal is stronger than precipitation influences. This is a consequence of temperature affecting the timing of snowmelt and thus the seasonal distribution of flows rather than annual totals. A change in the timing of the spring flood has also been observed due to changes in the timing of snowmelt. The tendency for a decrease in annual discharge in the southern catchments recognised by Hansson et al. (2011) was also detected by GailiuÅ¡is et al. (2011). They studied the variability of long-term monthly run-off in ï¬ve rivers draining into the Baltic Sea: the Nemunas, Neva, Odra, Vistula and LuleÃ¤lven. More than 100 years of data are available for all ï¬ve rivers, and the data for the Nemunas at Smalininkai starting in 1812 are one of the longest data sets for river run-off in Europe. Variability within the long-term run-off series was analysed by comparing the annual, highest and lowest monthly river discharges against the long-term mean to derive âanomaliesâ, integrated curves of annual discharges and the results of the MannâKendall trend test. A decrease of about 10 % in annual discharge was observed in the rivers on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea (Fig. 5.6). Cyclical variation with an amplitude of 26â27 years in the annual discharge data series is characteristic of the Nemunas, Neva, Vistula and Odra rivers. Variability in river discharge depends on natural environmental factors, especially on the cyclic variation in precipitation. However, drier and wetter phases in the studied Fig. 5.6 Change in average annual discharge with the cyclicity of about 27 year amplitude for the Nemunas and Odra (Oder) rivers (left axis) and for the Vistula and Neva rivers (right axis) (GailiuÅ¡is et al. 2011)"

365,520,0.354,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Abstract The predicted effects of climate change call for a multi-dimensional method to assess the performance of various agricultural systems across economic, environmental and social dimensions. Climate smart agriculture (CSA) recognizes that the three goals of climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience must be integrated into the framework of a sustainable agricultural system. However, current methods to determine a systemsâ ability to achieve CSA goals are lacking. This paper presents a new simulation-based method based on the Regional Integrated Assessment (RIA) methods developed by the Agricultural Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) for climate impact assessment. This method combines available data, field- and stakeholder-based surveys, biophysical and economic models, and future climate and socio-economic scenarios. It features an integrated farm and household approach and accounts for heterogeneity across biophysical and socioeconomic variables as well as temporal variability of climate indicators. This method allows for assessment of the technologies and practices of an agricultural system to achieve the three goals of CSA. The case study of a mixed crop livestock system in western Zimbabwe is highlighted as a typical smallholder agricultural systems in Africa."
364,253,0.354,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Flooding is a natural disaster caused by climatological factors such as temperature, rainfall distribution, evaporation, wind movements, and the natural terrain (Balek 1983). Fauchereau et al. (2003) and Camerlengo and Somchit (2000) have attributed the change in rainfall distribution to the global warming phenomenon. Flooding can be categorized into river flooding, flash floods, and storm surges. River flooding is caused by heavy and/or continuous rainfall over a period of a few days or weeks in a large area. An important characteristic of this type of flooding is the soil, which becomes saturated, exceeding its capacity to absorb water, and thereby increasing overland flow and water retention (Kron 2002; Berz et al. 2001). In Malaysia, the flood disasters that occur are due to flash floods, tropical storms, and monsoon storms. On the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the states of Terengganu, Kelantan, and Pahang, flooding normally occurs in the rainy season and the frequency of these floods is affected by changes in the monsoon seasons (Chan 1996; Jamaluddin and Sham 1987; Rose and Peter 2001). During the monsoon seasons there is a continuous and increased amount of rainfall, causing the river waters to overflow. Climate change is seen as a global phenomenon; however, its impacts are localized and long-term. The effects of climate change are evident in the increased occurrence of flooding in the coastal areas of Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor. Continuation of this scenario will have a significant impact on the societyâs culture and economically sensitive sectors as well as on the well-being of those affected. Among the impacts of floods are pollution; erosion; damage to building structures; loss of property; loss of life; damage to the drainage system; contamination of food and water; disruption of socio-economic activities, including the transportation, telecommunications, and services network; and loss of environmental services resulting from effects such as the degradation of agricultural soil. Flood occurrences in 2006 and 2007 amounted to RM 1.1 billion and RM 776 million in losses, respectively. This amount reflects only the losses incurred by the Malaysian government, and does not take into consideration losses sustained by flood victims and by the local economy. Those worst affected by the floods are residents who are weak and less well prepared. One of the strategies for flood risk management, therefore, is to make those vulnerable to flood disasters more resilient and better prepared. Efforts need to be focused toward mitigation and enhancing the adaptability or coping capabilities of these residents."

Zum anderen ist die Sonne weniger aktiv als vor etwa 15 Jahren. Die Klimamodelle im CMIP5-Projekt simulieren in der Regel fÃ¼r die letzten 15 Jahre einen deutlich stÃ¤rkeren Temperaturanstieg als beobachtet. Eine statistische Analyse von Modellen und Messdaten (Marotzke und Forster 2015) zeigt jedoch, dass man daraus nicht zwangslÃ¤ufig auf Modellfehler schlieÃen kann, sondern dass die Diskrepanz von der spontanen VariabilitÃ¤t des Klimas dominiert wird. Eine neue Analyse der globalen Mitteltemperatur (Karl et al. 2015) kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass der Temperaturtrend der letzten 15 Jahre tatsÃ¤chlich stÃ¤rker ist als in bisherigen Analysen berechnet. Demnach wÃ¤re die Diskrepanz zwischen Modellen und Beobachtungen deutlich geringer als bisher angenommen. Das letzte Wort ist in der Diskussion um den âHiatusâ sicherlich noch nicht gesprochen. Dank besserer Modelle und lÃ¤ngerer Beobachtung lÃ¤sst sich im FÃ¼nften noch klarer als im Vierten Sachstandsbericht nachweisen, dass der Mensch das Klima beeinflusst. So ist es jetzt âextrem wahrscheinlichâ, dass der Mensch mehr als die HÃ¤lfte des seit 1951 beobachteten Anstiegs der global gemittelten Temperatur verursacht hat. Ebenso gilt jetzt als âsehr wahrscheinlichâ, dass der Mensch mitverantwortlich ist fÃ¼r den seit 1979 beobachteten RÃ¼ckgang des arktischen Meereises (IPCC 2013a). Die CMIP5-Modelle werden nicht mehr nur fÃ¼r Projektionen Ã¼ber Zeitskalen von mehreren Jahrzehnten bis Jahrhunderten genutzt, sondern sie werden auch im Hinblick auf die QualitÃ¤t sogenannter dekadischer Vorhersagen analysiert. Im aktuellen Sachstandsbericht (IPCC 2013a) wird abgeschÃ¤tzt, dass bei Vorhersagen von 10 Jahren die Unsicherheit aufgrund interner KlimavariabilitÃ¤t deutlich hÃ¶her ist als die Unsicherheit, die sich aus dem Emissionsverlauf ergibt. Umgekehrt ist deren VerhÃ¤ltnis, wenn man mehrere Jahrzehnte betrachtet. Die Vorhersagbarkeit relativ kurzer ZeitrÃ¤ume wurde im CMIP5-Projekt getestet: Vergangene Dekaden wurden mit beobachteten Anfangswerten simuliert und diese mit historischen Simulationen verglichen, die nicht mit Beobachtungen initialisiert wurden. BezÃ¼glich der OberflÃ¤chentemperatur sowohl im globalen Mittel als auch in verschiedenen Regionen wie dem Nordatlantik, Teilen des SÃ¼dpazifiks und dem tropischen Indischen Ozean wurden bessere Ergebnisse erzielt, in anderen Regionen dagegen schlechtere. Da die dekadische Vorhersage ein neues Forschungsgebiet ist, kann in den nÃ¤chsten Jahren mit Verbesserungen gerechnet werden."

For example, the Ganges river basin is characterised by significant snowfall and precipitation in the northwest of its upper region and very high precipitation in the areas downstream in Bangladesh near the delta. High precipitation zones and dry rain shadow areas are located in the Brahmaputra river basin, whereas the worldâs highest precipitation area is situated in the Meghna river basin. Monsoon precipitation in the Ganges river basin lasts from July to October with only a small amount of rainfall occurring in December and January. The delta region experiences strong cyclonic storms, both before the commencement of the monsoon season, from March to May, and at the end of the monsoon from September to October. Some of these storms result in significant loss of life and the destruction of homes, crops, and livestock, most recently in Cyclone Sidr in 2007."

On short timescales, from days to decades, the initial conditions or internal state of the system matter. Aspects of the climate system are predictable on different timescales, out to a decade (when the deep ocean circulation is involved).

The climate is tropical semiarid, with ambient air temperature averaging around 28.8  C and temperature extremes vary between 24 and 40  C (Ly et al. 2013). The region is marked by a south to north gradient of increasing aridity as evapotranspiration (1700â2400 mm/year) exceeds annual precipitation (400â1200 mm) in each of three eco-regions (MECV 2007). Precipitation is extremely variable in space and time over the rainy season (May/June to September), and often such intense bursts run off rather than percolate into the groundwater. As a result, some water courses are intermittent, lying dry and dormant for weeks to months at a time (Ouedraogo 2010). To meet the growing demand for water amid chronic water scarcity, more than 1400 reservoirs were built since 1950, making Burkina a leading country in water resource development (Ouedraogo 2010) and governance (Niasse et al. 2004).

323,245,0.35,Satellite Earth Observations and Their Impact on Society and Policy,"Currently the most pertinent example of high-impact decision-making informed by science that would greatly beneï¬t from an enhanced observing system is connected to the ongoing controversy around the interpretation of the mandate of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Although the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) is already considered to be advanced in its implementation, the beneï¬t of reducing uncertainty in climate predictions by even better informed models through an improved GCOS justiï¬es further investment. The incremental annually recurring cost of implementing the GCOS is estimated to be in the range of 600â700 million USD, which can be compared to the average annual incremental climate mitigation cost for the next 20 years in the energy system, amounting to some 300 billion USD per annum (Rao 2009). At the two UN Earth Summits, it was realized that complex Earth processes can be adequately measured to support environmental decision-making only by linking and coordinating current observing systems. Since then, a number of Earth observation summits have been held, resulting in the establishment of the intergovernmental GEO at the third occasion. GEO provides the platform for coordinating observation strategies and investment in support of decision-making in nine SBAs (see Sect. 4.1.2.1). Prioritization of coordinating actions and investments to build a joint GEOSS necessitates an integrated assessment of the prospective economic, social, and environmental beneï¬ts. We have therefore developed methodologies and analytical toolsâfollowing a beneï¬t chain concept (GEOBENE 2016)âand applied them to assess the societal beneï¬ts of investments in improving the GEOSS across the nine SBAs. The basic idea is that the costs incurred by an incremental improvement in the observing systemâincluding data collection, interpretation, and information sharingâwill result in beneï¬ts through information cost reduction or better informed decisions. The resulting incremental societal beneï¬t is judged against the incremental cost of production. Since in many cases there are large uncertainties in the estimation of costs and particularly the beneï¬ts, it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms. Therefore, order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the costâbeneï¬t relationships can help guide investment decisions. There are generally two source categories for cost reductions in information delivery from building the GEOSS. The ï¬rst relates to cost reduction from economies of scale of a global or large observing system vis-Ã -vis the currently prevailing patchwork system of national or regional observing systems. For example, the costs of national forest carbon assessments aimed at policies of avoided deforestation typically amount to 100â500 USD per km2, yielding carbon stock estimation uncertainties of between 10â20%. A similar precision achieved by one consistent global forest observatory could be realized at much lower costs of some 10â100 USD per km2 (BÃ¶ttcher et al. 2009). The second source of cost reduction from GEOSS relates to economies of scope, which emerge when observing systems are combined. The Geo-Wiki Project"

38,431,0.35,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"10.2.2 Modelling Across Space and Time, Present to Future Other applications of modelling to policy development, planning and management require explanatory and/or predictive modelling to be performed not only across space, but also across time. The use of modelling to predict potential changes in biodiversity into the future, often referred to as âforecastsâ or âprojectionsâ (Coreau et al. 2009), as a function of ongoing impacts of environmental drivers (e.g., climate and land-use change), has gained particular prominence in recent years (Pereira et al. 2010; Cook et al. 2014). Such modelling poses special challenges, as there is usually considerable uncertainty associated with the future trajectories of relevant environmental drivers, which themselves will be affected by socio-economic events and decisions that are yet to occur, and are therefore highly unpredictable. These uncertainties are often addressed through the use of scenariosâi.e., multiple plausible trajectories for environmental drivers, that account for the reality that not just one, but many, futures are possible (van Vuuren et al. 2012). Model-based biodiversity projections under plausible scenarios of change in key drivers can contribute signiï¬cantly to policy agenda setting, by helping to characterise and communicate the potential magnitude of ongoing change in biodiversity, and therefore the need for action. By extending scenarios to further consider the effects of alternative policy or management interventions, such projections can also play an important role in decision supportâi.e., helping policy-makers, planners and managers to choose between possible actions for addressing the problem at hand, by modelling the difference that each of these alternatives is expected to make to projected outcomes for biodiversity (Cook et al. 2014). As for predictive modelling across geographical space, projections of biodiversity change into the future can be based on either inductive or deductive modelling (Pereira et al. 2010). When inductive models are employed for future projection, these are most often derived from correlative data analysis (i.e., explanatory modelling) of relationships between biodiversity and environmental drivers observed across space alone, rather than across time. Using such models to project changes across time involves space-for-time substitution. This assumes that"

Since 1950, high-temperature extremes (hot days, tropical nights, and heat waves) have become more frequent, while low-temperature extremes (cold spells, frost days) have become less frequent (EEA 2012). Since 1950, annual precipitation has increased in Northern Europe (up to +70 mm/decade) and decreased in parts of Southern Europe (EEA 2012). Hence, climate change is arguably the greatest emerging threat to global biodiversity and the functioning of local ecosystems. Climate is an extremely important driver of ecosystem processes in general, but especially so in freshwater ecosystems as thermal and hydrological regimes are strongly linked to climate. Atmospheric energy ï¬uxes and heat exchange strongly inï¬uence river water temperature, which is one of the most important factors in the chemo-physical environment of aquatic organisms (Caissie 2006). Besides temperature, climate directly affects runoff through the amount and type of precipitation. Increasingly, rising trends of surface runoff have been driven by more frequent episodes of intense rainfall. All river ï¬ow derives ultimately from precipitation, although geology, topography, soil type, and vegetation can help to determine the supply of water and the pathways by which precipitation reaches the river channel (Poff et al. 1997). Riverine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (1) many species within these habitats have limited dispersal abilities as the environment changes, (2) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent, and (3) many systems are already exposed to numerous human-induced pressures (Woodward et al. 2010). Aquatic organisms such as ï¬sh and macroinvertebrates are ectothermic. Hence, they are directly and indirectly dependent on the surrounding temperatures. Climate conditions affected species distributions already in the past. Species richness patterns across Europe can still be linked to the Last Glacial Maximum with the highest species richness in Peri-Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian Europe (Reyjol et al. 2007). The ecological consequences of future climate change in freshwater ecosystems will largely depend on the rate and magnitude of change related to climate forcing, i.e., changes in temperature and streamï¬ow. These changes not only imply absolute changes (increases or decreases) but also the increasing variation between extremes. The hydrological and thermal regimes of rivers directly and indirectly trigger different ecological processes. In the following section, we discuss water temperature and related processes in more detail. General principles of river hydrology are discussed in Chap. 4."

214,148,0.349,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"We return to this problem of subgrid variability later, but for now it is apparent that this variability often makes determining the tendency and forcing terms in models very complex, and it is one of the central challenges to climate modeling. It is an acute challenge for all components, but especially for the atmosphere. We often can only approximate the terms (statistically, for example) and cannot represent them explicitly: Hence, we build parameterizations or submodels of the different processes (also based on physical laws) and link them together. Figure 5.7c shows the step where the changes due to all the different processes are applied to basic physical equations. These equations are used to determine the winds and temperatures at every model grid box that will result from all the different processes, like radiation and clouds. This is often called the dynamical core of the model (Fig. 5.7c). The laws of physics and fluid motion describe what happens to a compressible fluid (air) when it is pushed, or heated. The temperature of the air helps determine where there is higher pressure (more density, often colder) and where there is less density (warmer). The equations describe how air tends to move from higher density to lower density. The wind we feel is just air motion. Changes in water (condensation, evaporation) are important in altering the heat content of the air (temperature). Other forces that pull on the air include drag, or friction from the surface (more over mountains and rough terrain than over smooth terrain, and varying with vegetation). This list of forcing terms is put into a set of equations to determine the response of the air to these changes (e.g., in winds or in temperature). Conservation of mass and energy are also applied. The winds are used to transport substances in the air: cloud drops, water vapor, and other substances"

The three focus watersheds (Dry Creek in Georgia, Cedar Creek in Michigan, and Orestimba Creek in California) were modeled using SWAT to simulate the daily hydrology and hydraulics and to route CPY sources in the watershed to the basin outlet. CPY runoff mass within each watershed was simulated using PRZM for Georgia and Michigan and winPRZM for California. Estimates of drift onto water surfaces were calculated from AgDrift. The Georgia and Michigan watersheds were delineated within the SWAT 2005 ArcView interface by using local 10 m digital elevation model (DEM) GIS data from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) and hydrography datasets from the area. These data were downloaded from the US Geological Survey available through the National Map data server (http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html) (Gesch 2007). Land cover/use for the locations was mapped within the model from the USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer (USDA 2012). The watersheds were subdivided in sub-basins, primarily at stream confluences, and an area threshold was used to include hydrologic response units (combinations of soils and land uses) that accounted for more than 5% of the watershed area. This threshold was used as a filter to aid in computational efficiency so that not every land use and soil combination is simulated. Datasets of rainfall and max/min temperature from local weather records were used to drive the hydrologic simulations. Simulations for the Georgia and Michigan watersheds were simulated for the 30-yr period of 1961â1990. To provide for a conservative assessment, all cropland eligible for CPY applications according to product labels in the Dry Creek and Cedar Creek watersheds were represented as âGA-pecan1â or âMI-cherries1â. For example, areas designated as pecan, cotton, sorghum, corn, peanut, and peaches in the Dry Creek watershed were represented as GA-pecan1, with respect to soil, crop, and CPY application"

365,765,0.347,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"In both countries, maize and rice yields are significantly reduced by climate change. Table 3 shows that between 2000 and 2050, yields of maize and rice are expected to decrease by 3% to 39% depending on the climate change scenario used. Yield of all three staple crops would decrease under both the NCAR and CSIRO models. As expected, yield reduction under CSIRO is greater than is the case under NCAR. Decrease of millet is the lowest â underscoring its resilience in the drylands. The maize and rice yields in both countries have a greater decrease for treatments receiving inorganic fertilizer than those which do not receive the treatment (Tables 3 and 4). This could be due to the higher variability of high input production systems under climate stress. Rainfed millet yield will decrease the least due to its resilience to dry conditions. The results show an average decrease of about 21% of staple food production â suggesting a reduction of household food security. This is especially high under farmer management practices, which are already lower and will decrease further even without climate change. Additionally, the results show different crop response to climate change and the need to emphasize crop diversification among farmers as one of the strategies for climate risk management."

214,28,0.347,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"occurrence is the highest probability (the mode). The total area under the line is the probability. If the total area is given a value of 1, then the area under each part of the curve is the fractional chance that an event exceeding some threshold will occur. In Fig. 1.1, the area to the right of point T1 is the probability that the temperature will be greater than T1, which might be about 20 % of the curve. The mean, or expected value, is the weighted average of the points. It need not be the point with the highest frequency. The mean value is the point at which half the probability (50 %) is on one side of the mean, and half on the other. The median is the value at which half the points are on one side and half on the other. Here is an important and obvious question: How can we predict the climate (for next season, next year, or 50 years from now) if we cannot predict the weather (in 5 or 10 days)? The answer is, we use probability: The climate is the distribution of probable weather. The weather is a particular location in that distribution, and it is conditional on the current state of the system. The chance of a hurricane hitting Miami next week depends mostly on whether one has formed or is forming, and if one has formed, whether it is heading in the direction of Miami. As another example, the chance of having a rainy day in Seattle in January is high. But, given a particular day in January, with a weather state that might be pushing storms well to the north or south, the probability of rain the next day might be very low. In 50 Januaries, though, the probability of rain would be high. So climate is the distribution of weather (sometimes unknown). Weather is a given state in that distribution (often uncertain). In a probability distribution of climate, the probabilities and the curve change over time: In the middle latitudes, the chance of snow is higher in winter than in summer. The curves will look different from place to place: Some climates have narrow distributions (see Fig. 1.2a), which means the weather is often very close to the average. Think about Hawaii, where the average of the daily highs and lows do not change much over the course of the year or Alaska, where the daily highs and lows may be the same as in Hawaii in summer, but not in winter. For Alaska the annual distribution of temperature is a very broad distribution (more like Fig. 1.2b)."

Because the model implicitly includes a constant, this means one needs k* = 13n years of data to obtain a unique solution for this critical equation. For n = 3, k* = 39. One could say that with a record length of 40 years, there would be only 1 degree of freedom left in the residual model error variance described by B. That would be unsatisfactory. When flows at many sites or in many seasons are required, the size of the disaggregation model can be reduced by disaggregation of the flows in stages and not attempting to explicitly reproduce every season-to-season correlation by constructing what have been called condensed and contemporaneous models (Lane 1979; Stedinger and Vogel 1984; Gryier and Stedinger 1988; Koutsoyiannis and Manetas 1996). Condensed models do not attempt to reproduce the cross-correlations among all the flow variates at the same site within a year (Lane 1979; Stedinger et al. 1985), whereas contemporaneous models are like the Markov model developed earlier in Sect. 8.5 and are essentially models developed for individual sites whose innovation vectors Vy have the needed cross-correlations to reproduce the cross-correlations of the concurrent flows (Camacho et al. 1985), as was done in Eq. 6.177. Grygier and Stedinger (1991) describe how this can be done for a condensed disaggregation model without generating inconsistencies."

The latter (runoff) occurs if the total water is greater than the holding capacity (or ï¬eld capacity) of soil. The type of surface matters a great deal: Different land surfaces have different albedos, so they absorb radiation differently, and different soil types hold different amounts of water. As in the atmosphere, water in the soil is also important in the energy cycle. Heat may go into the land surface to evaporate water rather than heating the surface, and this has profound impacts.

Climatechange simulations under elevated atmospheric CO2 predict pronounced shifts toward tree-dominated biomes (Scheiter and Higgins 2009). Changes in dry-season duration or precipitation seasonality will also influence the balance between grass and woody vegetation (Neilson et al. 1992; Bailey 2014). Mean annual precipitation (MAP) determines the potential âcarrying capacityâ for woody plants and upper limit for woody plant cover (Sankaran et al. 2005). As MAP increases, the potential for landscapes to support woody cover increases linearly, becoming asymptotic at ca. 650 mm (Fig. 2.4). Shrub or tree savanna or open woodland communities may therefore characterize regions where MAP is below this threshold, whereas the tendency to develop woodland or forest communities to the general exclusion of grasses occurs above this threshold. Managers contemplating actions to regulate woody plant cover should first determine their sitesâ MAP in relation to this potential. Expensive interventions may not be warranted in areas where maximum cover potentials are relatively low."

10,394,0.345,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"12.6.2 Cognitions Cognitions refers to the observations of reality, the frames of reference, and the interpretations of the actors at hand. While motivations among actors tend to differ widely, all actors across case studies tend to share similar cognitions based on observed changes in the regional water balance. There are general observations among nature conservation actors that precipitation regimes are changing in unexpected ways and that these regime changes influence both flora and fauna habitats. In recent years, a large number of creeks have gone dry, leaving behind almost non-existent vegetation. Damages from droughts are increasingly affecting agricultural yields in rural areas, while cities and their urban infrastructure are also more and more at risk as a result of lower reservoirs. The visibility of drought has increased in recent years, both in the farming and urban contexts as well, which in turn has contributed to widespread cognitive shifts among all nature conservation-related actors. More and more, stakeholders coherently and consistently agree that water scarcity and drought is, and will increasingly become, a problem. In response, strategies to combat drought impacts have already been developed into guidelines that keep water longer in the ground and in surface waters, employ water use efï¬ciency schemes, and develop medium- and long-term possibilities for extra water transport. These strategies further contribute towards a more uniï¬ed cognitions in nature arenas. As a result, it is expected that coherence among stakeholders will increase moving forward, with more experience with drought and water scarcity likely to develop into the future. Nature-related regulations, including the WFD and the Habitats and Birds Directives, in addition to creating driving pressures, also contribute to shifting cognitions among relevant actors as drought protection measures become more ubiquitous. More broadly, there is general cognition and awareness regarding the need for collaboration across a wide range of actors, including both public and private, at all levels. Because water scarcity and drought can impact both land, marine and freshwater ecosystems, connectivity is key to addressing the crises. Such a cognitive approach is particularly important in moving away from strictly legal incentives as the main motivators. In an effort to place less reliance on legal incentives, improving communication between actors and providing the tools and space for negotiating the relationship is the key. This approach allows for competing motivations to ï¬nd more harmonious solutions before resorting to a priori legal recommendations."

Regarding the nowcasting source, CIPCast receives (each 10 min) the current estimate of rain abundance and its prediction (estimated with a Local Area Model) for a time span of 60 min. The nowcasting data could be constituted either by the mosaic of several stations operating in speciï¬c points (at a national scale), mosaic which is then composed to obtain an unique picture or by a single station sweep that covers, in turn, a limited area (usually a single nowcasting station can cover an area of 20â30  103 km2).

198,498,0.344,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"The TAMD framework is for use in many contexts and at many scales to assess and compare the effectiveness of interventions that directly or indirectly assist populations in adapting to climate change. It also provides an explicit framework for two tracks; Track 1 entails assessing the capacity of institutions to undertake effective climate risk management (CRM) actions (also called top-down), while Track 2 entails assessing impacts of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability and the extent to which such interventions keep development on track (development performance or bottom-up) â Fig. 15.1. The TAMD operational framework8 has a set of eight commonly used indicators that can be used to measure top down/climate risk management processes being implemented by government institutions using a score card (these indicators are further described under the top-down process â Track 1). The operational framework then suggests that theories of change (ToCs) be used to measure the change pathways from adaptation interventions to development performance in bottom up processes (Track 2). It further suggests that linkages between climate risk management processes and development performance/adaptive capacity can be shown in a ToC. Thus the development of ToCs can be within one track or between tracks. The researchers therefore chose to measure top bottom processes with a score card and ToCs to show changes in adaptive capacity using bottom up approaches. In addition the researchers used a ToC to make the linkage between Tracks 1 and 2."

214,144,0.343,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Beijing all lie at the same latitude (40Â°N), but they have very different climates. Dry and moist regions are localized regionally, due to the contrasts between the land and ocean. Denver and Madrid are at relatively high altitudes, and Denver is in the middle of a continent, whereas Beijing is on the eastern edge of a continent. These geographic differences give rise to different climates. In the tropics, upward motion of air is favored where it is warmer over land, and where the ocean basins are warmer. Air moves up in some regions, and down in others. Warm water near Indonesia and tropical land masses over Africa and South America have preferentially upward motion, with downward motion favored in the eastern Paciï¬c. The tropical circulation pattern of upward and downward motion in particular regions is called the Walker Circulation after Sir Gilbert Walker, the longtime head of the Indian Meteorological Department in the early 20th century, who ï¬rst charted many of the tropical circulations. Air also moves poleward at upper levels due to this heat input in the tropics, and eventually it descends in the subtropics. Most modern GCMs do a good job of broadly reproducing these different dry and wet regions, or climate regimes. The driving forces are from the largest scales: land and ocean contrasts, the rotation of the earth. But getting the details right is critical for understanding how things evolve and will change at any given place. If the locations of the regions of precipitation (such as the edge of the tropical wet region) is off by a âsmallâ amount (a few hundred miles or kilometers), this may mean a vastly different climate at a particular place. Billions of people live in the subtropics, which lie both north and south of the equator (between *10Â° and *30Â° latitude). The subtropics include large swaths of India, Southeast Asia, China, Africa, and North America. We discuss the potential shifts in climate regimes further in Chap. 10, when we consider uncertainty. But societyâs vulnerability to climateâor to say it positively, the extreme adaptation of human populations to climateâmakes understanding and being able to simulate climate critical."

In this chapter, we describe the basics of how climate models are evaluated and how they are tested. The language and terms used in this discussion can be confusing. For example, the terms validation and evaluation are often used to mean different things, and a projection is not the same as a forecast. We will see why shortly.

In the tropics, large tracts of land under current agricultural practices have been covered by natural ecosystems not much longer than a generation ago, but in many cases this would only be a few decades or even just some years ago (Houghton 1994; FAO and JRC 2012). Because of this, current SOM dynamics will still be highly influenced by past vegetation. Therefore, the assumption of stable conditions in those systems is likely to result in gross inaccuracies. While the influence of past vegetation might of course be modeled, this would be done at the expense of bringing on further uncertainty to the results, as this impact is likely to vary with the type of vegetation, time since conversion, landscape position, soil type, etc."

220,68,0.342,The Ecological Scarcity Method for the European Union: A Volkswagen Research Initiative: Environmental Assessments,"The current publication of the ""Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"" (Forster, et al., 2007) serves as the reference for the global warming potential (GWP) of various gases. The reference substance is carbon dioxide (CO2). The potentials are adapted as required to new scientific findings and new substances are described. The values vary depending on the time period over which the effects are summed. GWP100 values (100-year integration time) are normally used (see Table 1) and are also used for characterization in the present report. The European Environment Agency statement (EEA 2014) is used here. The European Commission objective is to achieve a reduction of 80â95% compared to 1990 emission levels by 2050 (European Commission EC 2011). In the present case a reduction in an amount of the minimum target value of 80% has been assumed in the first step, since it is at this level that the target worded in this way would first be achieved. If good progress is made, this objective may be further adjusted on subsequent revision of the data (cf. Ahbe et al. 2014)."

376,179,0.342,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Center; launch is scheduled for early 2014. The resolution of spatial and temporal rainfall data derived with CPM will exceed that possible with previous designs and it will enable a much greater range of ecohydrological investigations in rangelands. Like other water-limited systems, rangelands are characterized by a strong coupling between the dynamics of soil moisture and vegetation productivity. Soil moisture can be estimated remotely, through either active or passive microwave-based systemsâeach of which involves a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution. Although passive microwave sensing can be used for routine, daily globalscale estimates of soil moisture (Njoku and Entekhabi 1996), which makes it an ideal technique for large-scale studies, it also has a clear limitation: the spatial resolution of retrievals is quite coarse (approximately 25 km) (McCabe et al. 2005). Active microwave sensing provides a higher spatial resolution (up to a few kilometers), but the repeat time is generally on the order of a few days. It is possible that improved data sets for large-scale ecohydrological investigations can be obtained by merging the best features from multiple systems and sensors (e.g., Liu et al. 2011)."

169,97,0.341,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Tropical rivers are characterized by distinct ï¬ow cycles related to dry and wet seasons. The tropical regime is similar to the pluvial regime, e.g., drought in the dry season and abundant rainfall in the wet season. Depending on the local conditions and position within the catchment, observed ï¬ow may represent a mixture of hydrological regimes. Flow regimes are very important to understand the key functions and processes of riverine ecosystems. Catchments are hydrological units deï¬ned as the area collecting the water within a given drainage divide or watershed (a drainage divide is the line that separates neighboring drainage basins). All the catchments for all the tributaries of a river are lumped together to form a river basin (e.g., Danube River Basin). The so-called water balance of a given catchment or basin is calculated from water gains (precipitation) and losses (evapotranspiration and runoff) including storage phases (soil water, groundwater, ice, snow). The observed discharge (m3/s) at distinct locations within the catchment is determined based on meteorological and biogeophysical factors (see Table 4.1). The river ï¬ow determines the dynamics of the four-dimensional river system (Ward 1989). Sediment and nutrient transport is closely linked to the longitudinal dimension of ï¬ow. Floodplain dynamics depend on the lateral hydrological connectivity and ï¬ood pulses (Junk et al. 1989). River groundwater interaction represents the vertical dimension of ï¬ow dynamics and determines groundwater recharge and groundwater contribution to river ï¬ow. The longitudinal, lateral, and vertical ï¬ow pattern varies over time representing the fourth dimension of the four-dimensional river system."

The ï¬tting of correlative species distribution models (SDMs) relating observations of presence, presence-absence, or abundance of a given species to multiple environmental variables (e.g., climate, terrain, soil, land-use variables) is probably the best known, and most widely applied, manifestation of such data analysis (Elith and Leathwick 2009). Other examples include statistical analyses of community-level, or ecosystem-level, attributes (e.g., species richness, functional diversity) measured at ï¬eld sites distributed across different classes of land use or management (de Baan et al. 2013; Newbold et al. 2015). Explanatory modelling of drivers affecting the spatial distribution of biodiversity may be all that is required for some applicationsâe.g., to inform development of government policy to reduce the detrimental impact of a particular form of land use or management. However if the environmental variables used in model ï¬tting are also mapped across an entire region of interest (e.g., as grids in a GIS) then a model derived through data analysis can, in turn, provide the foundation for prediction across geographical space (Miller et al. 2004). In the case of an SDM, this involves combining the ï¬tted model with environmental values for each grid-cell in the region to predict occurrence within that cell, thereby producing a complete map of"

This is particularly the case for the realization of climate change mitigation targets that stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations at levels that avoid a greater than 2 Â°C increase in average global temperatures above preindustrial levels. We have been investigating long-term energy and environmental strategies compatible with low atmospheric CO2 concentrations, employing a regionally disaggregated Dynamic New Earth 21 model (called DNE21). The energy model used here employs computational tools to conduct quantitative analyses on future global energy systems, but the outputs of the energy models should not be like the illusions in a fortune-tellerâs mystical crystal ball. Its major concern is, therefore, not to forecast a likely future image of the global energy system by extending secular trends in the systems, but rather to derive a normative future image of the systems through the comprehensive incorporation of forecasted future parameters and scenarios published in related academic literature and governmental reports."

214,390,0.34,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Different strategies can be used to better quantify the different types of uncertainty in climate model projections. One of the best, which can be used for quantifying all three types of uncertainty, is to run ensembles, or multiple simulations. These simulations are typically done to gauge one kind of uncertainty, but they can be appropriately mixed and matched to understand all three types of uncertainty. The use of ensembles is now also common in weather forecasting. Weather forecasting suffers from model uncertainty and especially initial condition uncertainty, but usually not scenario uncertainty as we have described it. However, sometimes external events such as ï¬re smoke can signiï¬cantly affect the weather. In weather forecasting, ensembles of a forecast model are typically run in parallel: multiple model runs at the same time. Then the spread of results of these parallel runs is analyzed. The simulations usually differ from each other by perturbing the initial conditions (slight variations in temperature, for example) and/or by altering the parameters in the model. Sometimes forecasters consult different models, creating another sort of ensemble. Altering initial conditions tests the initial condition"
214,352,0.34,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"When we are predicting climate over long timescales, we are really talking about a projection. Why is a projection different from a forecast? A projection is usually dependent on things that we do not know about the future. For a weather forecast, we can assume we know all the important things that can force the weather on the scale of a few days: the composition of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, for example. There may be important uncertainties in the ï¬ne-scale distribution, but the broad emissions are known. But in 50 years, what will the level of carbon dioxide be? That depends on what humans do, and thus we must estimate important parts of the system. We do this by constructing scenarios of the inputs needed for a coupled climate model: those things that force the climate system, such as the solar output or the composition of the atmosphere. Forcing usually implies effects on climate that are outside the model, like the sun. Solar output changes slightly over the course of the 11-year solar cycle, and we can estimate the change in output based on past"

In order to keep the equation as simple as possible, yet robust, the regression is based on one variable and tested in two basins of very different climatologyâs, topographyâs, land use patterns and annual water supply cycles. An important consideration between the gauge and BWI values is a lagged relationship between water accumulating near the surface and detected downstream at the gauge. The lag between the water input upstream and the detection of changes in flow downtstream is based on numerous empirical observations and theory that flow models are more accurate when they include the prior month(s) due to the time lapse for the water accumulate into the major stem of the river (Demirel et al. 2013). The number of prior months used in the predictions of flows is directly related to the size of the basin, the influence of snow melt and its topography.

344,42,0.339,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"2 Contributions to This Volume Following this overview of methodological approaches to quantitative policy evaluations, the twelve contributions to these proceedings can be subdivided into two parts: I. Theory and application of quantitative policy impact evaluation models, and II. Theory and application of quantitative approaches to model and evaluate policy processes. Part I is subdivided into three sections: 1. Macroeconomic Models, 2. MicroEconometric Models and 3. Micro-Macro Linked Models. As an opener to Sect. 1, O. Badiane, S. Odjo and F. Wouterse present their results for CAADP-reform strategies and the long-term outlook for growth and poverty reduction of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) member countries (Chapter âComparative Analysis of Strategies and Long Term Outlook for Growth and Poverty Reduction among ECOWAS Member Countriesâ). They use a recursive dynamic CGE model linked with a micro accounting model, transforming economic macro shocks into individual household income changes for their analysis. The second contribution of the section is by M. Wiebelt, K. Pauw, J.M. Matovu, E. Twinmukye and T. Benson. They provide a comprehensive analysis of the different policy options to use oil revenues in Uganda (Chapter âHow to Spend Ugandaâs Expected Oil Revenues? A CGE Analysis of the Agricultural and Poverty Impacts of Spending Optionsâ). As their analysis focuses on the implication on poverty, a recursive dynamic CGE model is linked with a micro accounting model transferring average income changes of representative households generated in the CGE model into a corresponding change of individual household income at the micro level. Econometric evaluation techniques are applied and discussed by S. Benin et al. in Chapter âImpact of the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) Program of Uganda: Considering Different Levels of Likely Contamination with the Treatmentâ. In particular, they develop and apply innovative matching approaches to assess the impact of an agricultural advisory services program in Uganda based on observational data. Furthermore, Sect. 2 contains two innovative micro-macro-linked approaches. In Chapter âModeling Agricultural Growth and Nutrition Linkages: Lessons from Tanzania and Malawiâ, K.

This is for two reasons: First, clouds are white. Clouds are white due to the size of drops absorbing uniformly across wavelengths. The presence of a cloud over a usually darker surface alters the energy input into the system. Second, clouds precipitate, and precipitation is critical for plants and the land surface (in addition to moving heat around). Clouds are also incredibly complex (and beautiful). Needless to say, all those wonderful shapes we see in the sky are well below the grid scale of any global model, and the interactions"

Column (5) is a two-step variant of the random effects interval regression, where the first stage uses a random effects probit equation to estimate the model for BAAC credit use. Results from the first stage are reported in Table 5.17. The different specifications and sensitivity analyses are presented in Puri 2006.

In the Macedon Ranges local government area the future climate is likely to include more hot days, less rainfall and run-off and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as drought, flash flooding and wildfire. The purpose of this project was to identify, analyse and evaluate climate change risks and develop an adaptation plan that would assist the Macedon Ranges Shire Council on the outskirts of Melbourne begin to plan for likely impacts arising from climate change. The development of the adaptation plan employed a best practice risk management approach in line with AS/NZS 31000:2009 and AS 5334:2013 and took and whole-of-council approach. Undertaking a risk assessment approach to climate change adaptation planning for a peri-urban local government area was successful. The approach assisted council to build capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment and define their area of operation, influence and responsibility in regards to adaptation actions and the role of other external stakeholders. Further, it helped them to integrate the risks and associated adaptation options directly into the existing risk register system and understand the relativity of climate risks to non-climate risks that the council faces, such as land use change, increasing proportions of absentee landholders and an ageing demographic.

241,376,0.337,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Finland was about 1600 mâ3 sâ1 in 1941 and the highest about 4700 mâ3 sâ1 in 1981, giving a ratio of about 3:1 between the highest and lowest annual outflow. The highest monthly outflows have normally been recorded in May during snowmelt floods, with a record value of about 10,350 mâ3 sâ1 in May 1920. The lowest monthly mean outflow was 640 mâ3 sâ1 in March 1942 giving a ratio of about 16:1 between the highest and lowest monthly outflow. Normally, outflow is lowest in winter and peaks in spring or early summer. The relative variation in monthly mean outflow was lowest in May (22 %) and highest in September (35 %). The discharge regime has changed over the decades in response to both climatic fluctuations and human impacts, predominantly water regulation. Although there is no statistically signiï¬cant change in the annual mean outflow from Finland for 1912â2004, climate change has affected the annual cycle of flow, particularly the seasonal distribution of flow. The most signiï¬cant change has occurred in the hydrological regimes of winter and spring. Both seasons have become milder during the twentieth century (see also Chap. 4, Sect. 4.4), and consequently, late-winter and earlyspring mean discharges have increased. However, the magnitudes of spring peak flow have not changed. Regulation has increased the winter and spring mean discharge in some places, while the summer flow has decreased. Winter and spring monthly mean discharges from Finland increased by 100â150 mâ3 sâ1 per decade during 1912â2004. June and July monthly mean discharges from Finland decreased by 85â195 mâ3 sâ1 per decade. Changes in seasonal discharge were different in different regions. Most drainage basins in Finland are affected by regulation, but especially in northern Finland and in Ostrobothnia. Winter and spring discharge increased mostly in the north, whereas summer discharge decreased speciï¬cally in southern Finland. Long-term changes in the individual discharge time series were similar to the changes in the outflow from Finland. At most sites, the winter and spring mean discharges increased at both unregulated and regulated sites. However, in northern Lapland, it seems more likely that winter discharge decreased. The increase in winter discharge focused on late winter and the increase in spring discharge on early spring. The rise in winter and spring discharge can almost certainly be attributed to warming in winter and spring and earlier snowmelt. At some regulated sites, the release of water has been increased in winter and early spring in order to increase the storage capacity for snowmelt water. This explains the stronger winter and spring discharge trends at some regulated sites. Spring high flow occurred earlier within the year at about a third of the observation sites. In most cases, this shift in timing was 1â8 days per decade. There is no overall change in the magnitude of spring high flow. At a third of the unregulated sites, summer discharge has increased,"

198,574,0.337,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract Brazil has historically coped with drought, a phenomenon that especially impacts the semi-arid lands of the Northeast. To deal with the various impacts of a current multi-year drought (2010-ongoing), the Government of Brazil, led by the Ministry of National Integration, partnered with the World Bank (WB) on a technical assistance program to foster proactive drought policy and management. The program works across sectors (climate/meteorology, water and sanitation, agriculture, environment, and disaster risk management) and levels (local, riverbasin, urban, state, regional and federal) in relation to the outcomes and stakeholders it aims to engage and influence, and trough the integration of WB Global Practices and programs. Inspired by successful models and lessons from other countries, the program aims to contribute to greater climate change resilience and reach a broad community of beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, partners convened to (1) build a Northeast Drought Monitor; and (2) pilot drought preparedness plans across Northeast. This chapter showcases the program and highlights key-milestones and direct and indirect outcomes identified by 2015. The institutional change process was assessed using qualitative analytical tools that integrate Outcome Mapping, the Capacity Development Results Framework, and Outcome Harvesting. Strengths, challenges, and outcomes (institutional changes) were identified, by tracking the programâs contribution throughout its duration and at its completion. The evidence shows that the initiative was able to convene key-regional and federal level multi-sector stakeholders at a decisive moment, resulting in an unprecedented bottom-up and regionally-led collaboration.

175,108,0.337,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","1.5.5 Planning and Management Aspects 1.5.5.1 Technical Technical aspects of planning include hydrologic assessments. Hydrologic assessments identify and characterize the properties of, and interactions among, the resources in the basin or region. This includes the land, the rainfall, the runoff, the stream and river flows, and the groundwater. Existing watershed land use and land cover, and future changes in this use and cover, result in part from existing and future changes in regional population and economy. Planning involves predicting changes in land use/covers and economic activities at watershed and river basin levels. These will influence the amount of runoff, and the concentrations of sediment and other quality constituents (organic wastes, nutrients, pesticides, etc.) in the runoff resulting from any given pattern of rainfall over the land area. These predictions will help planners estimate the quantities and qualities of flows throughout a watershed or basin, associated with any land use and water management policy. This in turn provides the basis for predicting the type and health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the basin. All of this may impact the economic development of the region, which is what, in part, determines the future demands for changes in land use and land cover. Technical aspects also include the estimation of the costs and beneï¬ts of any measures taken to manage the basinâs water resources. These measures might include:"

Especially affected are water-based ecosystems, such as wetlands and rivers, but also the composition of forested areas and grasslands. Climate changerelated impacts can be manifold (Table 1.1).

97,166,0.336,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Levels of greenhouse gases emissions per person are particularly high in cities in North America â often 25â50 times higher than in cities in low-income nations (Satterthwaite 2006). Cities are therefore drivers of climate change and at the same time increasingly at risk from its effects. At the global scale, climate change is expected to lead to significant sea level rise and to changes in frequency, intensity and spatial patterns of temperature, precipitation and other meteorological factors (IPCC 2015). Over the coming century, climate change scenarios project that urban regions will have to cope with and adapt to increasing extreme events (Rosenzweig et al. 2011a). Furthermore, cities already face aggravated impacts due to the higher presence of sealed surfaces which increase the magnitude of heat risk via the urban heat island (UHI) (Tan et al. 2010). Similarly, reduced water infiltration in highly paved urban areas generates increased risk of surface flooding at the local scale and regional scale (see Depietri et al. 2011 for a review), especially given that cities are often located in exposed coastal areas and floodplains. Negative impacts of climate extremes are likely to affect human health, energy and critical infrastructures, such as transportation, and water supply (McCarthy et al. 2010; Rosenzweig et al. 2011a). Many of these impacts are already being felt, especially by coastal communities (Spalding et al. 2014). So far, most efforts by cities to respond to climate change have focused on mitigation (i.e. reduction of greenhouse gases emissions) and much less on adaptation (i.e. long term strategies to reduce exposure, susceptibility and improve coping capacity of communities to hazards) as these strategies imply taking a precautionary and anticipatory approach (CastÃ¡n Broto and Bulkeley 2013). However, the implementation of adaptation plans is urgent. Changes in global climate are already underway and social, infrastructural, and economic costs of inaction are high (Bosello et al. 2012). In this chapter, we explore the role of grey, green, blue and hybrid infrastructures for climate change adaptation (CCA) in cities in order to shed light on the different resilience and sustainability opportunities available and their pros and cons for urban areas. We highlight the dependence of cities on healthy ecosystems and support the case for âhybridâ approaches as a key component of urban disaster risk reduction (DRR) and CCA through literature review and using New York City (NYC) as a case study. Natural capital (or the stock of biophysical resources), along with technological or infrastructural capital, are considered together in order to look closely at the interdependency and feedbacks between biophysical and technological domains of complex urban systems (McPhearson et al. 2016a,b) which challenge decision-makers faced with advancing CCA and DRR agendas.

349,352,0.336,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"of the studies they are taken from is however biased toward measurement campaigns conducted in Europe and North America. Other emission factors are estimated based on very limited data (e.g., single values for carbon stocks in agroforestry systems) or expert opinion (e.g., emission factor for methane emission from enteric fermentation is based on modeled results, not measurements, for Africa) (IPCC 2006). Global default emission factors are published in the National Guidelines for Inventories while other regionally relevant emission factors are available in the IPCC Emissions Factor database, peer-reviewed literature and in the future will be made available through the SAMPLES web platform. Empirical models are typically thought to generate reasonable approximations of GHG fluxes at higher levels of organizations and large spatial extent (Del Grosso et al. 2008), presuming the activity data are well constrained. This is because it is thought that at large scales such as across countries, the departure of actual fluxes from average emissions factor values will average out with aggregation of multiple land units. However, for any local scaleâfarms for example, where local environmental and management heterogeneity of conditions are not well represented in the global datasets, applying empirical models and emissions factors may represent a significant departure from actual fluxes. The relevance of using empirical models for farm-scale estimates of GHG balances is untested and perhaps spurious, especially for farming systems in developing countries. IPCC guidelines using Tier 1 default factors were not designed for this purpose. Tier 1 approaches were intended to be used when the source activity was relatively inconsequential to total GHG budgets, perhaps contributing less than 5 % of the total (IPCC 2006). Furthermore, significant variations in GHG flux rates occur between point locations due to edaphic mechanisms that control biological emission processes. Because observations of GHG fluxes for tropical smallholder farming systems are scarce or nearly missing in available databases, Tier 1 default factors may considerably misrepresent flux rates for such systems. In view of the low use of N fertilizers in sub-Saharan Africa it is therefore not surprising that many of the N2O fluxes currently being measured there are 1/3 to 1/2 of those estimated using the Tier 1 IPCC emission factors (Hickman et al. 2014; Shcherbak et al. 2014). A comprehensive evaluation of Tier 1 emission factors relating to GHG impacts measured in tropical regions is currently lacking. Despite these concerns and the uncertainty of the results, disaggregation of whole farms into component activities and applying available empirical models remains a way to estimate relative impacts of smallholder farming activities at the whole-farm level (Seebauer 2014), as well as understand emission hotspots and the research gaps. Emissions from livestock production in the tropics, namely from enteric fermentation and manure management, present their own challenges due to data scarcity (Goopy et al. 2016). Similarly to soil fluxes, emissions from both sources are poorly constrained and according to the review by Owen and Silver (2015) data for dairy manure management are limited in Africa and extremely scarce for other systems (Predotova et al. 2010). Yet in many countries, these sources are thought to be substantial contributors to total GHG budgets (Gerber et al. 2013)."

198,37,0.335,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract In 2014, the second conference on evaluating climate change and development offered the opportunity to take stock of evaluative evidence of the challenges, failures and success of climate change action. In 2011 one of the authors raised the possibility of a micro-macro paradox of climate change action (van den Berg, Evaluation 17:405, 2011): in his view evaluations of climate change action provided evidence that climate action works and achieves direct impact â yet climate change seems unstoppable. Several major, comprehensive evaluations were presented at the 2014 conference and provided an overview of actions taken and their successes and failures, as well as obstacles on the way to global impact. This chapter presents an overview of issues, evidence and the way forward for evaluators tackling climate action and sustainable development. The evidence provides support for the micro-macro paradox of 2011 and indicates that the global community has the technology and knowledge on how to stop climate change. However, actions that promote climate change still outweigh remedial climate action with at least a factor of 100. Thus current successes of programs and projects will not impact global trends, unless at the same time the non-sustainable subsidies and actions are stopped.

278,314,0.334,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"As mentioned previously, most of the indicators described in this chapter represent pressures rather than impacts in the strict sense defined by LCA. Most footprint indicators (and consumption-based accounting studies) are designed to portray indirect pressures (Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014), but there are recent attempts to introduce (environmental) impact assessment in footprint analysis. This is perhaps most prominently the case for water footprinting where it has been argued that the scarcity of water needs to be incorporated into the metric (Chenoweth et al. 2014; ISO 2014; Kounina et al. 2013; Ridoutt and Pfister 2010). Some recent studies related to trade weight water use with data on water scarcity (e.g. Lenzen et al. 2013; Orlowsky et al. 2014). A similar case can be made for the material footprint which sums up the mass of different raw materials into one number, thus reflecting an unweighted physical measure of pressure and potential impact (Wiedmann et al. 2015). Weighting according to actual environmental impacts has not been tried yet and is difficult, because different materials have different impacts, one material may have several impacts and characterisation data and models for localised impacts are not yet well developed. However, preliminary attempts of weighting resource footprints based on resource depletion have been presented (Fang and Heijungs 2014a). Yet, there remains value in reporting footprints based on pressures alone. The pure mass or volume of resource use is practical information that relates to physical reality, i.e. how much actually is flowing. It allows, for example, to address questions of allocation of limited supplies or security of supply and sustainability of overall production and consumption. The ultimate goal of footprint accounting in general (and the assessment of impacts embodied in trade specifically) should be an evaluation of whether or not particular activities are sustainable (Fang and Heijungs 2014b). Environmental footprints measure human appropriation of natural resources and need to be interpreted in the context of maximum sustainable levels at the local and the global scale (Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014). Exactly how high the sustainable thresholds of earth systems are is the subject of intense research (Steffen et al. 2015)."

97,46,0.333,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Climate change will influence several factors of importance to habitat quality and development of urban biodiversity. The projected change in temperatures, rainfall, extreme events and enhanced CO2 concentrations will influence a range of factors related to single species (e.g. physiology), population dynamics, species distribution patterns, species interactions and ecosystem services, as a result of spatial or temporal reorganisation (Bellard et al. 2012). Increasing urban temperatures and changed precipitation dynamics will influence species community development through limiting water availability during the growing season as well as changing the nutrient dynamics. Especially northern or alpine regions will be severely impacted due to enhanced temperature changes, e.g. as more common species will be able to colonise niches that were otherwise restricted to specialised species (DirnbÃ¶ck et al. 2011). Urban areas already have in many cases a higher plant richness compared to their natural counterparts (Faeth et al. 2011) due to influx of alien plant material, more nutrient-rich systems, a larger habitat heterogeneity and more continuous land use or directed management (Kowarik 2011). With a change in the urban climate, there is likely to be a change in invasiveness of alien species (Crossman et al. 2011) as well as an increase in the spread of disease and pests (Wilby and Perry 2006)."

This represents a necessary initial step towards local preparedness for drought and local awareness (Richard 2013) of the possible impacts of climate change on drought. It is also a ï¬rst modelling phase before initiating a common adaptation strategy resulting in adaptation measures. IAV clearly has technical resources and responsibilities for the management of the Arzal dam and its reservoir. The objectives of the two pilot measures (Sect. 6.3.1) show the investment of resources by IAV towards the aim of managing a multi-use reservoir. However, information about the responsibility of each stakeholder remains unclear: the water users (especially farmers) are not always fully aware of the quantity and the quality of the water they are using. Local governments, who are responsible for various controls on water withdrawal, are not often aware of their duties. Concerning drought management, the regulation from the SDAGE indicates the priority to be given for various water uses in the event of drought. However, it does so at a very local level, while water policy (e.g. policy on pumping and pollution control) is clearly under the responsibility of the State services (national level). Thus, the extent of resources and responsibilities is positive, but the distribution of resources and responsibilities could be more clearly addressed."

Concentrations in air that exceed 20 ng CYP mâ3 were generally near sources (areas of application), while those in the range 0.01â10 ng CYP mâ3 were regarded as âregionalâ, corresponding to distances of up to 100 km from sources. Concentrations less than 0.01 ng CYP mâ3 were considered to be âremoteâ. There is a possibility that lesser concentrations could have been measured close to sources if the prevailing wind direction is not from the source region. Approximately 70% of the data for concentrations in air were in the range of 0.01â1.0 ng CPY mâ3. For rain, the greatest frequency (40%) was in the range 1â10 ng CPY Lâ1.

The model developed here was designed to describe transport and fate of CPY from source to remote destinations and thus obtain a semi-quantitative assessment of its LRT characteristics and provide estimates of exposure concentrations at remote locations. Estimates can then be compared with measured concentrations from monitoring programs. The sensitivity of the results to uncertainty in the various input parameters can also be determined. Fundamental to assessing and predicting LRT of CPY and CPYO are reliable values for physical-chemical properties and rates of reaction by different processes that determine partitioning and persistence in the environment. Data from the literature were compiled and critically assessed to obtain consistent values of these physical-chemical properties (Tables 5, 6, and 7)."

This increase in temperature is about double that observed in the northern hemisphere over this period. The modelling studies discussed in Sect. 24.4 show that it is still difï¬cult to determine to what extent the observed warming in Scandinavia is caused by global climate change and to what extent it is caused by the strong regional decline in aerosol concentrations. However, the Baltic Sea area is on one of the major outflow paths of air pollutants from the European landmass, and so it is feasible that a substantial fraction of the observed warming is due to the strong decline in sulphur emissions over the last 20 years. Black carbon emissions have also decreased over this period although substantially less than for sulphur. Some of the warming might have been offset by the decreasing black carbon. Precipitation in Sweden seems to have increased between 1990 and 2005, but it is not statistically signiï¬cant compared to 1960â1990 (see climate records at www.smhi.se). Current climate models have considerable uncertainties in describing precipitation and its dependence on aerosols, which complicates discussions on the influence of air quality on precipitation. A better understanding of aerosolâcloud interactions is needed for climate models to better simulate observations, not only for precipitation but also for aerosols, gases, clouds and other parameters affecting precipitation (see Chap. 10)."

Thus, we make a distinction between North Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, Central Africa and East Africa. As the right model to use on our different panels could not be determined by the usual Hausman test, we used a generalized Hausman test which is in fact an increased regression that is asymptotically equivalent to the Hausman test (Wiggins 2003). The results of the test (Table 10.2) suggest that the fixed effects model is preferable to the random effects model for all samples. Later on, we used double effects fixed models, which are models that take into account countries characteristics and the effects that are specific to each period. Since the use of lagged values for some variables does not help to eliminate all the probability of endogenous factors in so far as hysteresis effects may still exist, we used the dynamic panel estimator of the generalized moments method (GMM) in first two-step differences based on the works of Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) (Roodman 2006). This is an estimator that is especially adapted to samples with many individuals (37 countries in our sample) and few periods (ten periods of three years each in our study). This estimator helps to eliminate order 1 autocorrelation, making it possible to validate the exogenous factors of the instruments used.

167,145,0.332,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"The probabilistic hydrological model, MARCS, includes five blocks. Each block contains the tools for (i) the data analysis and generalization (ii) the statistical methods for the data screening (both meteorological and hydrological), (iii) the schemes of the model parametrization (including regional oriented) and hindcasts, (vi) the forecasting, (v) the methods to perform statistical analyses and visualization of the modeling results (Table 8.1). To simulate the probability density functions of multi-year maximal runoff over the territory of the Russian Arctic, the following data were used: the reference climatology was calculated from the meteorological time series, which were obtained from the catalogs of climatology for 209 weather stations (Radionov and Fetterer 2003, Catalogue 1989). The observed daily time series of river discharges for the period from early 1930s to 2002 from the R-ArcticNET database (www.r-arcticnet. sr.unh.edu/v4.0/) as well as the dataset of the Russian State Hydrological Institute (www.hydrology.ru/) were collected for 108 river gauges located over the northern Russia. The daily discharges were used to calculate the annual time series of the spring flood depth of the runoff (SFDR, mm/(time period)) as the volume of spring flood (m3) from the drainage basin divided by its area (m2). The volume of spring flood (m3) was evaluated using flood beginning and ending dates (Shevnina 2013). The SFDR time series were used as the predicting value in the further analysis and modeling. The reason why the SFDR was chosen instead of the maximal discharge, is that it allows the regionalization and mapping, since the discharges depend on the watershed area. The river maximal discharge (m3s-1) with the required exceedance probability is calculated as described in Shevnina et al. (2016). The core of the MARCS hydrological model is the Pearson System, which allows to model the PDFs within 12 types depending on the values of the parameters.

Table 8.1 presents the indicators used to assess vulnerability and resilience to climate shocks. Two datasets are used for the analysis: 1998 small farmer survey data from the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Laboratoire dâAnalyse RÃ©gionale et dâExpertise Sociale (IFPRI and LARES 1998) and the data of the survey which was implemented within the Niger basin of Benin in the 2012â2013 agricultural year. Regarding the later survey, three-stage sampling is used. First, communes were randomly chosen within each agro-ecological zone (AEZ), based on their number of agricultural households. Second, 28 villages were randomly selected within selected communes and last, random farm households within selected villages. AEZ V was disregarded, because only one of its communes is located within the Niger basin. The sample size is 545 agricultural households. The questionnaire used is composed of eight sections ranging from demographic information to household assets and basic services. As for the 1998 small farmer survey, the households were selected using a two-stage stratified random sample procedure based on the 1997 Pre-Census of Agriculture. First, villages were randomly selected in each department, with the number of villages proportional to the volume of agricultural production. Second, in each village, nine households were randomly selected using the list prepared for the Pre-Census. The final sample size was 899 farm households in the country (153 farm households from 14 villages within the Niger basin of Benin). Regarding each data set, aggregation is done at village level using the weights attributed to each farm household. Moreover, additional information on the socioeconomic infrastructures has been collected through an informal discussion with the village chiefs (number of primary, secondary and high schools, number of maternities, communal hospitals, district hospitals, dispensaries, clinics, and drinking water sources). In addition to the primary data, the research benefited socio-economic data from the Institut National de la Statistique et de lâAnalyse Economique du BÃ©nin (INSAE) and climatic data from the Agence pour la SÃ©curitÃ© de la Navigation AÃ©rienne en Afrique et Ã  Madagascar (ASECNA).

The ï¬gure also shows that a warning sign is emerging for the Persian Gulf, Near East, North Africa, Central America, and North America. Meanwhile, water requirements for food production will signiï¬cantly increase in order to eradicate poverty in developing countries by 2030 and 2050 (Fig. 18.2). Thus, we will be facing a serious challenge in the near future. The greatest water withdrawal is due to the agricultural sector (Fig. 18.3a). However, there have been decreases in water withdrawals over the past three decades due to population and industrial growth (Fischer et al. 2007). Contrasting with Fig. 18.2, it shows the importance of agricultural water management now and in the future. Compared to rainfed agriculture, irrigation is advancing (Valipour 2012a, b, c, 2014a, b, c, 2015a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, 2016a, b; Valipour et al. 2012, 2013, 2015; Valipour and Eslamian 2014; Yannopoulos et al. 2015; Mahdizadeh Khasraghi et al. 2015). In addition, Fig. 18.3a conï¬rms the growth of other sectors compared to the agricultural sector. However, a considerable increase is citable for Czech, Canada, Croatia, and Denmark (Fig. 18.3b). This leads to increased pressure on renewable water resources and must be adjusted by appropriate management policies. It may be noted that there is an increase in irrigation water withdrawal for Macedonia and Mongolia with respect to Fig. 18.2. Nevertheless, the area equipped for irrigation per cultivated area (irrigation systems growth) has increased and also more than 40 % of irrigation potential has not yet been developed (Fig. 18.3c)."

221,443,0.331,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Group II. Following UNFCCC establishment, this seminar has focused not only on science and continues to function as a forum for knowledge exchange amongst Asiaâs climate change policymakers and related international organisations on responses to the UNFCCC. Meetings rotate within Asian nations and the 23rd was held in 2014. A Permanent Research-Dedicated Institution to Lead Environmental Research in Asia Under a prime ministerial initiative after the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) was established in 1998. IGES is an institute dedicated to conducting research on environmental issues in Asia. With a staff of about 200, including researchers from both within and outside Asia and management, it operates to maintain the various cooperative research networks and implement research activities that are mainly focused on Asia. Sharing Scientific Bases for Policymaking As shown in Fig. 12.2, a substantial amount of scientific data and assessment methodologies are required for policymaking in response to climate change. Of such, accurate ascertainment of GHG emissions and inventory work are particularly important. In recognition of thisâand of the importance of setting fundamental processes at an early stageâ GoJ, upon the request of the IPCC, established the Technical Support Unit (TSU) of the IPCC Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories at IGES in 1999. The IGES research units, in cooperation with the IPCC TSU and researchers from other Asian nations, led the task of amassing emission factors for Asiaâs unique forest soil and rice fields. In 2002, the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Office of Japan (GIO) was established in the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES). Using this office as a base, GoJ, in cooperation with IPCC TSU and the UNFCCC, launched the âWorkshop on Greenhouse Gas Inventories in Asia (WGIA)â in order to build capacity with the goal of ascertaining of GHG emissions throughout Asia. This workshop, which is hosted in a round-robin fashion by Asian countries, pairs up policymakers and researchers to form research communities that can maintain scientific accuracy over the long term. The latest data shared at the workshops is also reflected in national communications and policy formation in each country. The year 2014 marked the 13th year of this workshop, and since 2013, when BUR became obligatory, it has attracted over 120 delegates. These workshops have greatly contributed to estimating GHG emissions in Asia based on sharing of QA/QC methods and mutual learning. Consistent Support for Policy Formulation Based on Integrated Assessment Models The application of integrated assessment models is indispensable in refining and coalescing the ideas of disparate ministries and agencies into consistent plans and policies for individual countries, including NAMAs and INDCs. The National Institute for Environmental Studies and Kyoto University began developing the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) for climate policy in 1990, the goal of which is to promote its use in Asian countries, and joint research with China and India has taken place. Based on five years of research from 2004, this model is at"

As a consequence, there seems to be a lack of plans or other instruments regarding drought adaptation, as well as a lack of long-term vision for this issue. This means that the district government is under no pressure due to obligations on the topic of climate change adaptation in general or drought in particular, and nor have the relevant resources been made available. Although they recognise the importance of the issue, they do not see themselves in a position to take it up, and so the district government is currently not driving any process (e.g. establishing its own guidelines, programmes, or implementing adaptation initiatives). It is individual actors that are initiating interesting activitiesâthe DROP project being one of them. The Waterboard Eifel-Rur, a drinking water producer and a hydroelectricity producer interviewed all emphasised the existence of technical projects to enhance the systemâs robustness, improve risk management and develop backup solutions in case of extreme events. We can say that drought prevention is being addressed in the context of general risk management strategies that use as inputsâ precipitation patterns. WVER can thus be described as the driving force of change in the region. As the responsible for most things water in the Eifel, they are also the ï¬rst in line to be affected by drought issues, which explains their taking a proactive approach.

222,122,0.33,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"In the period of this research, the SDGs have been developed and adopted globally as development targets for 2030 (UN 2015). They comprise a set of 17 âGlobal Goalsâ with 169 targets between them and are encouraging global activity on how to achieve and how to measure these achievements (Szabo et al. 2016), including in Bangladesh. The SDGs have essential and ambitious targets that are important today. This is reflected in the short timescale aiming to achieve most of these goals by 2030. However, 2030 is too close to experience significant climate and environmental changes, and therefore, the long-term needs for adaptation are not explicitly embedded in the SDGs. While not designed explicitly to support the SDGs, the approaches described in this book have great potential in this regard. In particular they can provide interdisciplinary insights on several SDGs and consider both short-term and long-term trends and their context. This was discussed and supported in a two-day meeting presenting the results in this book, held at the Royal Society, London in November 2016. These approaches already provide a wide range of indicators across the societal and environmental domains, which may be more suitable than many simple measured indicators used previously. Trends in river flows, sediment fluxes and coastal salinity are three relevant trends discussed in this book that relate to various SDGs, and especially SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation). Furthermore, the methods are flexible and can be developed and targeted as required."
151,87,0.33,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"A comprehensive ecotoxicological risk assessment of CYP was developed for birds and mammals (Solomon et al. 2001) and aquatic environments (Giesy et al. 1999) that were near areas of application. The analysis of LRT of CPY and CPYO presented here extends those assessments to regions downwind of points of application. The approach taken in this study was to compile and evaluate data on concentrations of CPY and CPYO at locations both near to applications and remote from sources. This assessment of LRT thus goes beyond determination of CTD to include estimates of concentrations of CPY and CPYO in other environmental media such as rain, snow, and terrestrial phases as well as in the atmosphere at more remote locations, including high altitudes. This was accomplished by developing a relatively simple mass-balance model, predictions from which could be compared to available measured concentrations of CYP in air and other media. This can provide an order-of-magnitude test of the accuracy of the predictions of the model, and, in this way, make an indirect assessment of the relative importance of the included processes and parameters. The model can then serve as a semi-quantitative predictive framework that is consistent with observations. The equations included in the model enable examination of the effect of changes in parameters such as application rate, temperature, meteorology, distance from source and precipitation. Estimated concentrations in terrestrial and aquatic environments remote from areas of application can be used, in combination with toxicological data, to assess risk to organisms in those media and locations. Monitoring data. Reports of concentrations of CPY in air at a variety of locations are presented in Table 1, with comments on other influencing factors such as altitude. Also included are reports of concentrations of toxicologically-relevant transformation products, such as CPYO, if and when such information was available. Reports of concentrations of CPY in precipitation (rain and snow) are given in Table 2, while Table 3 provides data for water bodies and other terrestrial media."

38,434,0.329,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"monitoring perspective can be detected only through in situ observation. Locations at which changes in these variables are measured directly therefore tend to be distributed very sparsely, and often unevenly, across the planetâs surface. In contrast, changes in environmental driversâe.g. climate, land useâare often more amenable to detection through remote sensing, and therefore potentially mappable across large geographical extents. For applications in policy, planning or management that require complete geographical coverage of information on biodiversity change, predictive modelling can play a valuable role in translating mapped changes in key drivers, generated through remote sensing, into expected changes in biodiversity (Lung et al. 2012; Soberon and Peterson 2009). The models underpinning such translation can, again, be either deductive or inductive, with the latter derived from explanatory modelling of biological and environmental data distributed either across space alone (and therefore constituting another form of space-for-time substitution), or across both space and time. The remainder of this chapter explores, in greater depth, this last role of modelling in biodiversity monitoringâi.e., the use of predictive modelling to help map past-to-present changes in the distribution of biodiversity across large spatial extents."

221,157,0.329,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Abstract This section presents lessons learnt from Thailand in climate policy design. Thailand has filled the gap between modelling analyses and climate policy development in its Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA). Thailandâs mitigation pledge under NAMA framework was successfully designed and communicated to UNFCCC in COP20. The integrated assessment modelling analysis plays an important role in the development of Thailand NAMA. Consensus building was derived from several discussions among stakeholders of NAMA implementation. Criteria for selection of greenhouse gas countermeasures were based on cost optimization by using a module of the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model called âAIM/Enduseâ, abatement costs, co-benefits and feasibility of implementation. In addition, economic feasibility of countermeasures in NAMA actions was also assessed. Then, NAMA implementation has been prepared based on assumptions concerning limitations of resources, capital requirement, timing and appropriateness for Thailand. Since 2012 Thailandâs mitigation pledge to UNFCCC has been prepared on the basis of domestic appropriate measures. Co-benefits of NAMAs are also assessed, and they reveal positive aspects of GHG mitigation under NAMA framework. Results found that Thailand has high potential of GHG emission reduction by both domestically supported NAMAs and internationally supported NAMAs about 23â73 million tonnes CO2 per year in 2020 or approximately accounted for 7â20 % in 2020 of the total GHG emissions. The NAMA actions include measures in (1) renewable electricity, (2) energy efficiency, (3) biofuels in transportation and (4) environmental sustainable transport system. These GHG countermeasures are in line with the national policy and plans of ministries of energy and transport in order to avoid the conflict between climate policy and policies of the related ministries. Results of cost optimization, co-benefits, economics and appropriateness are also necessary for communication among policymakers, administrators, academic researchers and the public on consensus building.

214,437,0.328,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"slide.17 Enhanced flow can make glaciers at the edge of ice sheets flow faster (more icebergs). Models are attempting to simulate this. But the current versions of ice sheet models, even when trying to simulate these bottom (basal) lubrication processes, have not been able to get much mass loss at a rapid rate, and not as fast as observations over the past 20 years or so. This is a serious deï¬ciency in model evaluation, and one reason why projections of sea-level change are so uncertain. But as new processes are discovered, this may change. Or maybe estimates will be revised downward as we better understand the simulations and pieces of them. As long as we know what is missing and what the uncertainty is, we can gauge whether a prediction is wrong, and also in what direction. Is a projection an overestimate or underestimate? Or an upper or lower limit? Thus, what really makes a projection âbadâ is overconï¬dence, or underrepresentation of uncertainty. Often uncertainty is stated somewhere, but not presented well or ignored. The lesson is always to try to understand a projectionâs stated uncertainty. This is true in general, not just for climate models. The best practice for using models is to go back to the model documentation or description to make sure a proper representation of uncertainty is available, and an analysis of the model ï¬t for the purpose is assessed. For example, projections of changes to a phenomena based on models with a bad representation of the present phenomena (like the South Asian summer monsoon, for example) may fall into this category."
233,208,0.328,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"How the ED Method Converts PD-Dissimilarities to Estimates of Gains and Losses âEDâ refers to a specific family of âenvironmental diversityâ calculations (Faith and Walker 1996a, b, c; Faith 2003; Faith et al. 2003, 2004). ED typically uses an environmental gradients space, derived using species compositional dissimilarities and ordination methods (Faith and Walker 1996a, b, c). ED has been implemented as a surrogates strategy in biodiversity conservation-planning software that evaluates nominated sets of localities or finds best sites to add to an existing set. For example, ED provided the first integration of âcostsâ into regional biodiversity planning based on comparing gains or âED-complementarityâ values to marginal costs to facilitate trade-offs, balancing biodiversity conservation and other needs of society (Faith et al. 1996). In order to understand the applicability of ED to PD-dissimilarities, we have to consider EDâs assumptions and then examine a simple example analysis. I referred above to unimodal response (Fig. 1b) and the shared-habitat/shared-features companion model to PDâs shared-ancestry/shared-features model. ED explicitly builds on this general unimodal response of species (or other elements) to environmental gradients (for background, see Austin 1985; Faith et al. 1987). EDâs environmental space typically is derived using compositional dissimilarities (including those estimated GDM) and ordination methods (for review, see Faith et al. 2004). The dissimilarities, the ordination methods and GDM all are relatively robust approaches under a general model of unimodal responses to environmental gradients (Fig. 1b; Faith et al. 1987; Faith and Walker 1996a; Ferrier et al. 2009). The unimodal response model not only guides the inference of an environmental space using ordination methods (Faith et al. 1987), but also defines how ED methods"

Alternatively, remote-sensing-derived indicators can be analyzed directly for trends over time or used as a covariate to analyze or interpret field observations (e.g., White et al. 2005; Dardel et al. 2014; Brandt et al. 2014).

The model was also evaluated for its ability to simulate maize grain yield variability across farming households. The model showed capacity to simulate the middle yield range from the farming households but did not perform so well for the lower and higher yields (Masikati et al. 2015).

Predisposing factors are current and antecedent stresses that increase an ecosystemâs susceptibility to short-duration stresses, such as drought (inciting factor), or to longer term change in climate (contributing factor). Predisposing factors include stresses related to current states or values of variables that are internal to ecosystems and dynamic over ecological timescales (current regional climate, soil resources, biota, and disturbance regime; lower panel). In the upper panel, we illustrate a case in which climate change (contributing factor) exacerbates negative effects of a recent stress, such as drought (inciting factor), for a rangeland on which processes already are limited by a warm/dry climate, overgrazing, or a sparse, species-poor plant canopy (predisposing factors) to increase process variability sufficiently to change average process levels"
376,123,0.327,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Although numerous efforts have sought to elucidate the proximate causes of woody encroachment, robust generalizations remain elusive. The WPE process is highly context dependent and influenced by numerous, interacting location-specific factors related to climate, fire frequency and intensity, grazing/browsing regimes, soil properties, and functional traits of the encroaching species and native browsers. MAP sets an upper limit to woody plant cover, which tends to plateau to a maximum above 650 mm. However, local patterns of disturbance (fire, browsing) and soil properties (texture, depth) may prevent this potential from being realized. In the absence of these constraints, interactions among the seasonality, interannual variation, and intensity of precipitation events will determine the rate and extent of woody plant recruitment. Precipitation in arid grasslands varies markedly in both space and time. This can cause cover of woody plants to wax and wane at decadal or longer time scales, which helps to explain the high variation observed in rates of WPE. Climate zones with higher precipitation have the capacity for rapid conversion from grassland to woodland, but decadal-scale variation in precipitation can make it difficult to distinguish natural fluctuations from directional changes in vegetation communities."

Predick, Susanne Schwinning, Robert J. Steidl, and Steven R. Woods Abstract Woody vegetation in grasslands and savannas has increased worldwide over the past 100â200 years. This phenomenon of âwoody plant encroachmentâ (WPE) has been documented to occur at different times but at comparable rates in rangelands of the Americas, Australia, and southern Africa. The objectives of this chapter are to review (1) the process of WPE and its causes, (2) consequences for ecosystem function and the provision of services, and (3) the effectiveness of management interventions aimed at reducing woody cover. Explanations for WPE require consideration of multiple interacting drivers and constraints and their variation through time at a given site. Mean annual precipitation sets an upper limit to woody plant cover, but local patterns of disturbance (fire, browsing) and soil properties (texture, depth) prevent the realization of this potential. In the absence of these constraints, seasonality, interannual variation, and intensity of precipitation events determine the rate and extent of woody plant expansion. Although probably not a triggering factor, rising atmospheric CO2 levels may have favored C3 woody plant growth. WPE coincided with the global intensification of livestock grazing that by reducing fine fuels, hence fire frequency and intensity, facilitated WPE. From a conservation perspective, WPE threatens the maintenance of grassland and savanna"

This applies particularly to bog woodlands (91D0), which are by definition associated with wet organic sites, deep peat layers and high ground-water levels, as well as to alluvial softwood forests (91E0) that lost their functional connection to a flowing water body and are no longer regularly flooded. In both cases, small-scale loss or drift of the respective habitat types is theoretically possible. However, serious changes of the water regime are currently not expected for montane zones characterised by windward weather situations with high amounts of precipitation. The climate-based evaluation of gradual zonal habitat drifts within the BR relies on the assumption that the current classification is ecologically plausible and correct. However, the first reporting and surveying of the forest habitat types was relatively coarse. For example, Luzulo-Fagetum habitat types are reported for spring-influenced or alluvial azonal stand patches, where habitat types 91E0 and 9180 (Stellario-Alnetum, Carici remotae-Fraxinetum and Ulmo glabrae-Aceretum pseudoplatani) ought to be present. Highly likely changes of the species composition typical for correctly classified habitat types were evaluated regarding the potential occurrence of plant associations (realised niche) and typical species (fundamental niche) of the respective habitat types (see Fig. 16.6). Depending on the habitat type, âoptimalâ and âgoodâ ratings for species composition are lost if the share of typical species falls below 90 % and 60 %, respectively. This is expected for 6 ha of Vaccinio-Piceetea habitats (9410) on wet or moderately moist mesotrophic, slightly to highly skeletal"

This trend is expected to continue. Climate change is projected to magnify the frequency and intensity of weatherrelated hazards, which already account for the majority of annual losses from disasters (IPCC 2012, 2014; UNISDR 2010). Consequently, resilience has emerged as a central concept in international and national development policy together with the concept of mainstreaming (Pervin et al. 2013; Wilkinson et al. 2014). Today, increasing resilience through the mainstreaming (or integration) of climate risk considerations into sector work is a unifying goal for the domains of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (Andrade et al. 2011; Wamsler 2014). Resilience, i.e., â[T]the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from their effects (â¦)â (UNISDR 2009, 2015), is also a feature of related global agendas, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015â 2030, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement."

97,53,0.325,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions such as green roofs, rain gardens and bioswales have been shown to reduce local flooding, economical loss and discomfort at storm events with medium or frequent return periods. Still, it is important to remember that these small-scale installations have little impact on the large-scale catastrophic rain events such as river flooding, seaside flooding or very intense cloud bursts that pose the greatest danger to urban infrastructure and communities. Thus, there is a need to work on multiple spatial scales to adapt to changing precipitation dynamics focussing both on the installation of local solutions and developing zoning regulations for housing developments as well as planning for safer proactively planned flooding areas forming an integrated and multifunctional urban drainage system (Fletcher et al. 2015; Burns et al. 2012). There has been a rapidly increasing body of research on the efficiency and function of individual installations (see also Davies and Naumann, this volume; Enzi et al., this volume). Green roofs have been shown to have large effects on annual stormwater runoff but also on peak flows (Bengtsson 2005; Stovin et al. 2013; Stovin 2010). Thin green roofs have a limited storage capacity meaning that these systems have reduced efficiency on very long or intense rain events (Bengtsson 2005). Green roofs and other vegetated systems might influence the water quality of runoff water negatively if conventional fertilisers are used or if they contain nutrient-rich compost without addition of substances such as biochar (Beecham and Razzaghmanesh 2015; Gong et al. 2014; Beck et al. 2011). Bioswales, biofilters or rainbeds or other types of planted retention beds are alternative solutions to handle stormwater on ground if space is available. Ground-based systems can be built with thicker substrates as compared to roofs, which simplifies the use of large perennials, shrubs and small trees. Functionally, these systems also have a potential for infiltration and evapotranspiration (Daly et al. 2012; Muthanna et al. 2008)."

365,206,0.324,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"We begin with an approach of estimating the effects of climate on rice yields using a panel regression with a single growing season metric for each weather covariate (average min T, max T, and precipitation across the growing season). Using average seasonal conditions, we estimate a linear model for each rice production system. These are later used to predict yields under various climate scenarios. Here, we present a variation of the panel fixed effects (FE) model. This model is an accepted and commonly applied model in the literature (see e.g. Lobell and Burke 2010). Panel data contains repeated observations of the same units over time. In this case we repeatedly observe district rice outcomes. Panel data allows the use of fixed effects, which control for a variety of observations that are unobserved. By conditioning on fixed effects, county specific deviations in weather from the county averages are used to identify the effect of weather on yields. Specifically we chose to control for district and year fixed effects. District fixed effects control for any unobservable characteristic that varies across district but is constant over time. This accounts for important differences across districts such as soil conditions or areas with a higher prevalence of intensive production systems. Year fixed effects control for any unobservable characteristic that varies across years but is constant across all districts. This includes national time trends such as improved technology (irrigation, fertilizer use, or the introduction of improved seed varieties for example). Within this framework there are a number of choices/assumptions to be made. In each case, there is a tradeoff between controlling for unobserved factors and observing enough variation in the data to be able to make econometric estimations. In reality, we know that there are many factors that affect crop yields, including soil quality, technology, agrochemicals, endogenous behavior, etc. Here, we are only considering the impact of weather, while the other factors are unobserved by us. Thus we are trying to estimate the disaggregated yield impact of weather holding constant other explanatory variables. If district-level time-series data were available on other factors such as agricultural investment, fertilizer use, or pesticides, then we could include these explanatory variables in our model. However, to our knowledge these data do not exist at the required resolution. Fortunately, the fixed effects model attempts to control for these unobserved factors, so that we can still produce unbiased estimates of climate effects. In other words, we can control for a variety of unobserved characteristics but cannot estimate them in our model. We are not attempting to explain every factor that affects yields, but merely to identify the effect of temperature and rainfall. Given our interest is ultimately how yields will change in the face of new climate conditions this does not affect our analysis. The following reduced form model is our primary empirical specification. In our ideal specification we would have a vector of controls for the other factors that affect yields that we have previously discussed. This would include characteristics such as fertilizer use, pesticide use, soil quality, etc. However, data of this quality does not exist in Lao PDR, which is why we rely on fixed effects."

Shrub encroachment into grasslands is often classified as a âtriggerâ for soil degradation and âdesertificationâ (Schlesinger et al. 1990). But a study conducted in a semiarid Mediterranean grassland in Spain showed that the effect can also be opposite (Maestre et al. 2009). In this example, shrubs establishing in degraded pastures created âislands of fertilityâ that enhanced vascular plant richness, microbial biomass, soil fertility, and nitrogen mineralization. In this sense, shrubs may be seen as reversing, rather than causing, desertification. Regardless of changes in vegetation and soil structure, there are physical limits to the magnitude with which WPE can modify the hydrological budget. Potential effects are greatest where precipitation approximately equals PET (Zhang et al. 2001); above or below this threshold, ET is constrained either by precipitation or PET. Grassland and savanna biomes occur under both climate conditions. The Great Plains of North America, for example, straddle regions with precipitation surplus to the east and precipitation deficit to the west (Fig. 2.10). Therefore, WPE should have maximal hydrological consequences in central regions of the USA. There are several caveats to these generalizations and we mention two: first, there are hydrological systems with large bypass-flow components. Bypass flow is"

365,325,0.323,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The AgBizEnvironment module utilizes existing environmental models or calculators to quantify the environmental outcomes and links this information either directly to net returns (if we can construct a shadow price or cost of the outcomes) or provides direct measures of environmental issues of concern such as changes in GHG emissions, soil erosion, carbon soil sequestration and energy usage. Examples include the Environmental Impact Quotient Value (EIQ) formula developed by Cornell University, Cool Farm Tool which measures GHG (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) emissions, COMET-farm which is a whole farm carbon and GHG accounting systems, and the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) calculator and its many variations. Outputs from these models or calculators can be categorized as either an input to the production process and/or an (desirable or undesirable) output from the production process. GHG emissions and soil carbon credits are often characterized as outputs, although soil carbon can also be an input to the quality of the natural capital; pesticide use, soil erosion, and soil carbon are considered both production inputs and outputs. Table 3 provides an overview of these environmental simulation tools available within AgBizEnvironment, their outputs, and their applicability in producer-decision support frameworks. Using the AgBizEnvironment module and associated environmental calculators, we explored the economic and environmental tradeoffs for switching to a conservation management practice for the winter wheat-fallow rotation. From AgBizProfit we calculated the change in farm-level net returns in the mid-Columbia region of switching to no-till (which is a more conservation-oriented, water conserving management practice) from conventional tillage. No-till has lower variable costs and labor requirements given the absence of the tillage operations pre- and post-harvest. However herbicide applications increase under no-till management in order to control weeds that would otherwise be managed with tillage, and equipment (airseeded) costs increased. Based on research trials, wheat yields in this micro region are essentially the same between the two systems, at about 63 bu./acre. This yield exceeds the 49.5 bu./acre used in the previous example which was estimated from the 2007 Ag Census data. We opted to use the higher research trial yields for the AgBizEnvironment since it reflects the conditions in this smaller micro-region (Table 3). For the baseline scenario, since the yields and revenues were taken to be the same between the two systems, variation in net returns is due to costs. Under this baseline scenario, net returns for no-till exceed the net returns for conventional tillage by approximately $29 per acre, or alternatively the yield advantage from conventional tillage would need to be about 6â7 bu./acre greater than no-till to equalize the net returns (Way 2015). So why do we not see a much larger adoption rate for the no-till management? In part, the answer may reside with combination of risk and expertise. At this point in the software development, AgBizProfit does not incorporate risk as it relates to management expertise. Environmental impacts of concern also could include GHG emissions and possible soil erosion. These impacts were calculated using the COMET-Farm model for calculating changes in nitrous oxide and soil carbon equivalents only and the"

Eine unzureichende Behandlung dieser Prozesse in regionalen Modellen kann beim Einsatz auf der Klimazeitskala dazu fÃ¼hren, dass fÃ¼r die Sommermonate Temperatur und Niederschlag im Modell schlechter mit den Beobachtungen Ã¼bereinstimmen als fÃ¼r die Wintermonate (Kotlarski et al. 2014). Durch die unterschiedlichen Anforderungen auf der Wetterund Klimazeitskala bezÃ¼glich der Wechselwirkungen kÃ¶nnen regionale Klimamodelle hier nur wenig von den Entwicklungen in der Wettervorhersage profitieren. Vielmehr mÃ¼ssen eigenstÃ¤ndige regionale Erdsystemmodelle entwickelt werden, die die zentralen Wechselwirkungen zwischen Boden und AtmosphÃ¤re, Ozean und AtmosphÃ¤re oder Aerosolen und Wolken berÃ¼cksichtigen. Modellrechnungen mit hÃ¶heren AuflÃ¶sungen benÃ¶tigen zudem eine erhÃ¶hte Rechenleistung. Im Prinzip fÃ¼hrt eine Verdoppelung der AuflÃ¶sung zu einer 8-fach erhÃ¶hten Anzahl von notwendigen Berechnungen (Verdoppelung der Gitterpunkte in Ost-West- und SÃ¼d-Nord-Richtung bei halbiertem Zeitschritt). Diese Erfordernisse erfÃ¼llen Rechenzentren durch innovative Rechnersysteme. Die damit verbundenen Umstellungen erfordern hÃ¤ufig eine Anpassung der inneren Strukturen und Codes der Regionalmodelle und damit jeweils einen technischen Aufwand. Weil Regionalmodelle nur einen Gebietsausschnitt behandeln, benÃ¶tigen sie Antriebsdaten an den RÃ¤ndern des Modellgebiets (Randbedingungen). DafÃ¼r mÃ¼ssen die Daten des jeweils verwendeten Globalmodells dem Regionalmodell auf seiner hÃ¶heren rÃ¤umlichen und zeitlichen AuflÃ¶sung zur VerfÃ¼gung gestellt werden. Dabei treten grundsÃ¤tzliche mathematische und physikalische Probleme auf. Ein Effekt, der in diesem Zusammenhang beobachtet wird, ist das Auftreten von Wolken und intensiven NiederschlÃ¤gen an den RÃ¤ndern der betrachteten Region, fÃ¼r die es im verwendeten Globalmodell keine Hinweise gibt. Auch wenn sich solche Fehler auf den Randbereich des Regionalmodells beschrÃ¤nken, kÃ¶nnen sie die Ergebnisse im inneren Modellgebiet beeinflussen (Giorgi und Mearns 1999). Eine sogenannte Zweiwegekopplung hebt den Unterschied zwischen dem angetriebenen Regionalmodell und dem antreibenden Modell teilweise auf, indem das Regionalmodell auch das Globalmodell beeinflusst (Giorgi und Mearns 1999; Rummukainen 2010). WÃ¤hrend das globale Modell die EinflÃ¼sse von auÃen auf die Zielregion liefert, bestimmt das regionale Modell die VorgÃ¤nge im Innern seines Modellgebiets. FÃ¼r einige Regionalmodelle wird derzeit eine solche Zweiwegekopplung entwickelt. Vor allem fÃ¼r die Darstellung der Sommermonate in Europa kÃ¶nnte es hilfreich sein, dass das Regionalmodell dadurch leichter eigene Zirkulationsstrukturen durchsetzen kann: Im Sommer beeinflussen regionale Prozesse das Klima stÃ¤rker als im Winter, wenn der groÃrÃ¤umige Transport von Luftmassen entscheidender ist (Giorgi und Mearns 1999; Vautard et al. 2013)."

The BIP partners provided a range of metrics focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem service trends, pressures and threats, and responses. Some 31 time series metrics were gathered. Not all of the CBD headline indicators were populated (Walpole et al. 2009), but this still represented a large increase in available data for the Third Global Biodiversity Outlook in 2010 compared to its predecessor in 2007 prior to the formation of the BIP. Post-2010, the BIP has reoriented to the Aichi Targets and a focus on 2020. The partnership is strengthening to include a deeper and a wider breath of data providers. As a result, the BIP was able to deliver a ï¬rst indicator-based analysis of progress towards the Aichi Targets using a larger number of time series metrics than in 2010 (Tittensor et al. 2014). The partnership also serves to raise awareness of the Targets amongst the observing community, creates links to other processes and agreements requiring indicators, and provides opportunities to share global methods and metrics with national governments and indicator practitioners to help develop capacity and to harmonise across scales. The BIP is a complementary mechanism to GEO BON. Whilst GEO BON focuses on improving biodiversity observations that can be used in policy tools such as indicators, the BIP focuses on compiling and delivering those indicators for policy users.

169,620,0.322,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Originating in the 1970s, the ES concept became an issue in the international environmental discussions in the 1990s. Since then its inï¬uence has continued to rise. An important milestone was Robert Costanzaâs publication on the value of worldâs natural capital and ES that calculated the total value of worldâs ES with $16â$54 trillion per year (Costanza et al. 1997). A more recent publication by Costanza et al. (2014) gives an updated estimate for the total global ES in 2011 of $125 trillion per year. Other important steps were the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2003) that assessed the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being, the TEEB initiative (TEEB 2010) that highlighted the global economic beneï¬ts of biodiversity, and the establishment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2015) that acts as an interface between scientists and policy-makers. Furthermore, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2010) has a strong focus on ES and includes this issue as one of its strategic goals. A comprehensive review on the history of the ES concept is given by GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. (2010). In the ï¬eld of landscape planning, the ES approach is comparable with the idea of âlandscape functionalityâ that has already been an issue for decades (Kienast 2010; Von Haaren and Albert 2011; Grunewald and Bastian 2013). Although this concept overlaps to a certain extent with the understanding of ES, many open questions remain before the ES concept is fully integrated in landscape research and decisionmaking (Hermann et al. 2014). Depending on the research question and the context, there are different ways to categorize ES. An overview of these different classiï¬cations is given by, e.g., HÃ¤yhÃ¤ and Franzese (2014). The most commonly used classiï¬cation was developed in the frame of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2003) that divided ES into four categories: supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. Below, some examples are listed for the freshwater context (based on Aylward et al. 2005):"

241,981,0.322,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"streams, hydrological regimes during winter and spring have changed signiï¬cantly (see also Chap. 5). This is mainly attributed to winters and springs becoming milder and in consequence late-winter and early-spring discharges increasing. Studies combining several hydrological model simulations (to the end of this century) in the Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme show that while results varied depending on the climate change scenario and model boundary conditions, some projections were consistent between runs, for example an overall increased autumn and winter run-off and increased annual run-off volume in northern Sweden (Andreasson et al. 2004). In a similar study focusing on river run-off for the entire Baltic Sea drainage basin, Graham (2004) found a general trend of reduced river flow from the south-eastern Baltic Sea catchment together with increased river flow from the north. The magnitude and timing of the spring flood is important for the annual fluxes of dissolved and particulate matter in boreal river systems (Woo et al. 2008). Higher spring temperatures and a higher proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain could result in earlier snowmelt and thinner snowpacks. This would lead to spring floods occurring earlier in the year and having a lower magnitude (Andreasson et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2008). However, in high-latitude catchments, sustained sub-zero winter temperatures coupled with increased precipitation may lead to maintained or even increased spring floods (Dankers and Middelkoop 2008). Rantakari et al. (2010) compared TOC fluxes in headwater streams between two climatically different years and found decreased TOC export during the spring ice melt period and increasing export during the rest of the year including snowcover and snow-free periods. Wet years have been shown to favour the export of TOC from forest-dominated areas (Kohler et al. 2009) and imply that future wetter conditions may increase the TOC export as well as many elements associated with TOC such as Al, Fe, trace elements and potentially harmful elements such as Hg. Empirical models of streamwater fluxes of DOC including both soil temperature and water fluxes have been able to predict seasonal variation in streamwater DOC concentrations reasonably accurately showing that both parameters are important (Kohler et al. 2009). Simulations of a climatic scenario with an average temperature increase of about 2.5 Â°C and increase in precipitation of 25 % for a boreal headwater stream suggest an increase in the annual TOC export of approximately 15 % (Kohler et al. 2009). The model simulations also indicate that the autumn months are particularly sensitive and that wetter and warmer conditions could cause a TOC increase of up to 5 mg lâ1 (Kohler et al. 2009). Temperature effects related to snow cover may also have profound effects on waterborne DOC export from forests (Agren et al. 2010). Higher temperature in organic soils has been shown to increase DOC export, not because of"

365,23,0.321,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Climate change poses a major and growing threat to global food security. Population growth and rising incomes in much of the developing world have pushed demand for food and other agricultural products to unprecedented levels. FAO has estimated that, in order to meet food demand in 2050, annual world production of crops and livestock will need to be 60% higher than it was in 2006. In developing countries, about 80% of the required increase will need to come from higher yields and increased cropping intensity and only 20% from expansion of arable land1. Meeting food demand for a growing population is already a formidable challenge for the agriculture sector, but it will be further exacerbated by climate change. The expected effects of climate change â higher temperatures, extreme weather events, water shortages, rising sea levels, the disruption of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity â will generate significant effects on the different dimensions and determinants of food security by affecting the productivity of rainfed crops and forage, reducing water availability and changing the severity and distribution of crop and livestock diseases. The fifth assessment report of the IPCC released in 2014 found that climate change effects are already being felt on agriculture and food security, and the negative impacts are most likely in tropical zones where most of the worldâs poor agricultural dependent populations are located. Through its impacts on agriculture, climate change will make it more difficult to meet the key Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger, achieving year-round food security, and ensuring sustainable food production systems by 2030. The magnitude and speed of climate change, and the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation efforts in agriculture, will be critical to the future of large segments of the worldâs population. Integrating the effects of climate change into agricultural development planning is a major challenge. This requires technology and policy measures to reduce vulnerability and increase the capacity of producers, particularly smallholders, to effectively adapt. At the same time, given agricultureâs role as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and the high rate of emissions growth experienced with recent conventional intensification strategies, there is a need to look for low emissions growth opportunities and adequate policies. Policymakers are thus challenged to ensure that agriculture contributes to addressing food security, development and climate change. In this frame, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach that calls for integration of the need for adaptation and the possibility of mitigation in agricultural growth strategies to support food security. The concept was launched by FAO in 20102, gaining rapid and widespread interest and attention. CSA goes beyond agricultural practices and technologies to include enabling policies and institutions as well as identification of financing mechanisms. There are significant intellectual and policy gaps to be filled in CSA literature. An economic decision-making framework will also assist in identifying challenges for CSA application."

The ratios for the global year 2000 estimates for NOx, SO2, and BC were 1.17, 1.40 and 1.13, respectively (Granier et al. 2011). The ratios for the global inventories were small compared to the variation in the regional inventories which usually ranged between 1.5 and 3.0. The spread gives an impression of consensus but is not an uncertainty analysis. For example, Bond et al. (2004) estimated global fossil black carbon emissions in 1996 as 3.0 Tg C, with an uncertainty range of 2.0â7.4 Tg C, or +150 % and 30 %; this is in strong contrast with the ratio of 1.13 between highest and lowest global inventory for this pollutant. Smith et al. (2011) performed an uncertainty analysis for global and regional sulphur dioxide emissions and concluded that the overall global uncertainty is relatively small: 6â10 % over the twentieth century, but regional uncertainties ranged up to 30 %. For the SO2 year 2000 and values presented in Table 4.2, the uncertainty, based on Smith et al. (2011), would be ~10 % and ~30 % for anthropogenic land-based sources and shipping, respectively. The calculated global SO2 uncertainty bounds are relatively small: the low value is due to cancellation between source categories and regions. This uncertainty level would appear to be unrealistically low given that a number of previous global sulphur dioxide emissions estimates do not fall within this estimated uncertainty bound (the ratio high-low inventories was 1.40; see Granier et al. (2011) for a compilation). The reason is that additional, essentially correlated uncertainties are present that add to the uncertainty value estimated above. Examples include reporting or other biases in global data sets for energy, sulfur removal, and other driver data, methodological assumptions, and the use of common default assumptions for sources where little data exists. Sulphur emissions are less uncertain than emissions of the other air pollutants listed in"

IUGG and its Associations operate through more than 110 scientiï¬c divisions, commissions, committees, working groups, and services. IUGG holds general and scientiï¬c assemblies, during which policies governing the union are discussed and adopted, and research programs requiring international participation are formulated, coordinated, and planned. At the assemblies, national delegates of IUGG Member countries pass resolutions on important scientiï¬c and science policy issues, particularly related to natural hazards and reduction of risks (Ismail-Zadeh 2016). IUGG Associations work to set global standards for research, such as the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF 2014), the Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice (Bormann 2012), and the Guidelines for Professional Interaction during Volcanic Crises (IAVCEI Subcommittee for Crisis Protocols 1999). In particular, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame provides a realization (i.e., a set of coordinates of some points located on the Earthâs surface) to the International Terrestrial Reference System, a world spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth in its diurnal motion in space. World navigation systems are referenced either to a speciï¬c ITRF realization or to their own coordinate systems, which are then referenced to an ITRF realization. Precise navigation assists in monitoring natural hazards, particularly movements of landslides, lavas, lahar, and debris flows. IUGG Associations oversee eighteen geodetic and geophysical services, particularly those related to monitoring natural hazards. For example, IAG established an observing system â the Global Geodetic Observing Systemâwhich works with IAGâs international services to provide the geodetic infrastructure necessary for monitoring the Earth system including hazards and disasters and for global change research (Plag and Pearlman 2009)."
241,1422,0.321,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The rest of this section summarises other studies of global-scale carbon emissions. Pongratz et al. (2009a) performed transient simulations over the entire last millennium with a GCM that couples the atmosphere, ocean and land surface with a closed carbon cycle. By applying the ALCC of Pongratz et al. (2008) as the only forcing to the climate system, they showed that the terrestrial biosphere experienced a net loss of 96 Gt C over the last millennium, leading to an increase in atmospheric CO2 by 20 ppm. The biosphereâatmosphere coupling led therefore to a restoration of 37 and 48 % of the primary emissions over the industrial period (AD 1850â2000) and pre-industrial period (AD 800â 1850), respectively. Atmospheric CO2 rose above natural variability by late mediaeval times, but global mean temperatures were not signiï¬cantly altered until strong population growth in the industrial period. Pongratz et al. (2009a) also found that only long-lasting epidemics or wars led to carbon sequestration because emissions from past ALCC compensate carbon uptake in âregrowingâ vegetation for several decades. Reick et al. (2010) derived the CO2 emissions associated with ALCCs since AD 800 as reconstructed by Pongratz et al. (2008) and compared them with the preindustrial development of atmospheric CO2 known from Antarctic ice cores. They concluded that pre-industrial traces of CO2 emissions from ALCC before AD 1750 was obscured by other processes of similar magnitude, while the steep increase in atmospheric CO2 after AD 1750 and until AD 1850 (i.e. before the rise of fossil fuel emissions to signiï¬cant values) was largely explained by rising emissions from ALCC. These results partly contrast with those of Kaplan et al. (2010) who found that by AD 1850, at the global scale, the cumulative CO2 emissions due to deforestation since 6000 BC were 137â189 Pg C (using the HYDE scenarios of ALCC) and 325â357 Pg C (using the KK ALCC scenarios of Kaplan et al. (2009)). Kaplan et al. (2010) concluded that their results support the hypothesis that anthropogenic activities led to the stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at a level that made the world substantially warmer than it would otherwise have been. Similarly, Boyle et al. (2011) showed by using new model assumptions that the quantity of terrestrial carbon release due to early farming, even using the most conservative assumptions, greatly exceeds the net terrestrial carbon release estimated by inverse modelling of ice core data by Elsig et al. (2009). However, the conclusions of both Kaplan et al. (2010) and Boyle et al. (2011) remain an open question as the emission estimates are not compatible with current understanding of the global carbon cycle and records from ice cores."

To prevent the soil from clogging the drainage layer and the perforated pipe, a geo-textile was placed on top of the gravel drainage layer. The soil used to construct the model slopes was ï¬rst sieved through a #40 sieve using a mechanical shaker and mixed with sufï¬cient water to have an initial moisture content of 12%, corresponding to the ï¬eld moisture content. The soil was placed in 5 cm thick lifts compacted to a void ratio of 1.2 to create a slope inclined at 40Â°. The completed model slope is pictured in Fig. 1. Tensiometers and accelerometers were installed at various locations and depths (Figs. 2 and 3) within the slope to instrument the slope in order to measure the pore water pressure during the seismic loading and the post-earthquake rainfall event. Decagon T5 tensiometers with an active surface area of 0.5 cm2 and a 5 mm diameter ceramic tip were used in this study. They are capable of recording pore water pressures ranging from +100 to â85 kPa. The holes made to install the tensiometers were backï¬lled with the slope material and the surface was covered with a bentonite slurry to prevent preferential movement of water through those locations. The slope was then subjected to different ground motions using the shake table at California State University, Fullerton. The 1.5 m Ã 2 m shake table uses a 25 kN actuator and has a Â±6.5 cm horizontal capacity. The model slope was subjected to sinusoidal motions with accelerations ranging in amplitude from 0.1 g to 0.3 g with frequencies between 1 and 3 Hz. Each motion was applied for 10 to 50 cycles of loading. The ground motion recorded at Station 90095 during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake was also applied to the slope model. The ground motions applied are shown in Fig. 4. Following the seismic loading, a rain simulator system was placed on top of the slope. The system was used to apply rainfall at an intensity of 3.6 cm/h until the slope became completely saturated, as determined from the location of the wetting front. A photograph of the rain simulator system applying rainfall to the model slope is presented in Fig. 5. A second model was prepared following the procedure described above and instrumented as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this model, the slope was subjected to rainfall without any seismic excitation. The results obtained served as baseline in order to compare the effect of the seismic loading on the observed responses. The slope geometry and material properties were used to perform numerical simulations using the SEEP/W, SIGMA/W, and QUAKE/W modules in the GeoStudio software suite. SEEP/W was used obtain the pore-water pressure distribution. The seismic loading was simulated using QUAKE/W, in which the input motion was the same as that used in the experimental models, as shown in Fig. 4."

For further improvements in monthly streamflow, more detailed information (for example, reservoirs, dams, and irrigation) needs to be collected. To save space, six gaugesâtwo in the west (1249 and 1121), one in the northwestern mountains (1370), two in the lower middle (1418 and 1549), and one in the east of the basin (1740)âwere used to graphically illustrate simulated and observed streamflow. The simulated and observed streamflow at these gauges is shown in Fig. 12.10. Flow time series curves show the model captured well seasonal variation in streamflow, snowmelt, and evapotranspiration, although peaks are not always perfectly simulated. The hydrological regime of the rivers in this region is characterized by low flow in the cold dry winter, resulting in accumulation of snow at high altitudes, and high flow during summer caused by monsoon precipitation and melting of glacier ice and snow. Snow season in the mountain area elevation of 3000 m often starts from late autumn to the next early summer. In the pre-monsoon and early monsoon season (May to July), snowmelt from all subwatersheds contributes signiï¬cantly to river"

In addition, they are relatively simple compared to more complete daily weather generators and many other applications. Generated streamflows have been called synthetic to distinguish them from historical observations (Fiering 1967). The ï¬eld has been called stochastic hydrologic modeling. More detailed presentations can be found in Marco et al. (1989) and Salas (1993). River basin simulation studies can use many sets of streamflow, rainfall, evaporation, and/or temperature sequences to evaluate the statistical properties of the performance of alternative water resources systems. For this purpose, synthetic flows and other generated quantities should resemble, statistically, those sequences that are likely to be experienced during the planning period. Figure 6.12 illustrates how synthetic streamflow, rainfall, and other stochastic sequences are used in conjunction with projections of future demands and other economic data to determine how different system designs and operating policies might perform. Use of only the historical flow or rainfall record in water resource studies does not allow for the testing of alternative designs and policies against the range of sequences that are likely to occur in the future. We can be very conï¬dent that the future historical sequence of flows will not be the historical one, yet there is important"
391,894,0.32,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"5.1.2.6 Satellite Measurements of Trace Gases Over the Oceans Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4,) are the two most important greenhouse gases (GHG) being modified directly by anthropogenic activity, primarily fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning and land use change. In 1957, during the International Geophysical Year, IGY, accurate measurements of the mixing ratio of CO2 at the Mauna Loa Observatory, led by C.D. Keeling, were initiated. These revealed the growth of CO2, attributed to fossil fuel combustion, and the annual biogeochemical seasonal cycling of CO2. Measurements were extended to other sites and to include CH4 and other relevant gases, resulting in a global but sparse network. However global measurements at high spatial resolution are needed to identify and assess the local and regional response of CO2 and CH4 surface fluxes in a warming world and for the verification of national inventories of GHG. During the 1980s, the retrieval of the total dry atmospheric columns of CO2 and CH4 from space was proposed as part of the SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY, Burrows et al. 1995 and Bovensmann et al. 1999) mission.

The partnership was proposed as a voluntary commitment to the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, Sendai, Japan, 2015, and also as tools for implementing and monitoring the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals. It was approved and signed by 16 global stakeholders in the afternoon of the same day in Sendai, Japan, and the Secretary-General Mr. Petteri Taalas of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) signed it on 16 April 2016. The number of current ICL members (as of 30 November 2016) that are a part of the Sendai Partnerships is 64. The number will be updated every year. The signatory organizations may increase at the high-level panel discussion and the round-table discussion during the Fourth World Landslide Forum in Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2017. The Sendai Partnerships is being updated during the period. The Sendai partnerships acknowledge that â¢ At a higher level, social and ï¬nancial investment is vital for understanding and reducing landslide disaster risk, in particular social and institutional vulnerability, through coordination of policies, planning, research, capacity development, and the production of publications and tools that are accessible, available free of charge and are easy to use for everyone in both developing and developed countries. Landslide science and technologies have continuously been developed to be more reliable, precise or cost-effective for landslide disaster risk reduction over the world. However, this scientiï¬c and technological progress has not been shared equally over the world. The gap between the available level of science and technologies and the practical use of those in many countries, regions and communities is very wide. To ï¬ll this gap, ICL has created Landslide Interactive Teaching Tools, which are always updated and continuously improved, based on responses from users and lessons during their application. All text books gradually become outdated. To avoid this problem, ICL plans to upload the latest teaching tools in the WEB of Teaching Tools and print text tools periodically."

337,327,0.319,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"DECUMA has been applied in Kajiado District, southwest Kenya, and applications are ongoing in Samburu, Kenya, as well as Mali and Tibet. The Malian application provides an example of the usefulness of making tools used in integration portable. In that work, led by N. Hanan of South Dakota State University, we are exploring changes in the hydrology of lakes, the roles that pastoral people have had in those changes, and the benefits to them. A hydrological model (SWAT; Gassman et al. 2007) is being linked to the ecosystem model called ACE (African Carbon Exchange), which in turn is being linked to DECUMA. By programmatically isolating the materials DECUMA requires from an ecosystem model (see Boone et al. 2011 for details), we can relatively easily link the model with any ecosystem simulation tool that can provide the needed information (e.g., forage availability and forage acquired by animals). Our ongoing analyses in Samburu, Kenya demonstrates this kind of integrated modeling. C. Lesorogol of Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri has gathered in-depth anthropological data for two study sites in southwest Samburu District, Mbaringon and Siambu. The sites differ in ecological settings, with Mbaringon at lower elevation and with less rainfall, for example. But the main difference of anthropological interest is that Siambu is subdivided, and Mbaringon remains communal lands (although somewhat fragmented). In the 1970s residents within some districts in Kenya began to subdivide into individually owned parcels. In Siambu, the land was divided into 240 small individually owned parcels. We are also investigating changes in Samburu norms, where the sense of reciprocity and sharing is less important in young peoplesâ lives. Our integrated assessments are driven by both theoretical questions and by questions put forth by stakeholders (Reid et al. 2009). The eight scenarios (numbered below) we are addressing in Samburu reflect this, and highlight the flexibility of using comprehensive simulation tools such as SAVANNA and DECUMA. Central to our work are questions of subdivision and its effects. We are simulating sedentarizing people and their animals on individually owned parcels, and the effects of that on livelihoods (1). Another scenario asks about the influence of commercial cropping in Siambu and fence building in Mbaringon, and the effects of loss of access has on livestock (2). These types of scenarios are represented in the modeling system by altering spatial surfaces or agent behaviors so as to prevent animals from leaving home parcels or from using areas that are inaccessible. We describe a diversity of scenarios to demonstrate the utility of integrated modeling but discuss one (number 8) in more detail here. Both Siambu and Mbaringon are grazing refuges for herders outside those areas. When drought conditions hold in other areas of Samburu, herders move their animals into these areas. In a scenario, we are adding additional livestock to each area, and summarizing effects on the resident animals (3). Plains zebras (Equus quagga) and occasionally Grevyâs zebras (Equus grevyi) are joined by various antelopes in the Mbaringon study site. We will vary the numbers of wildlife by a factor of four in scenarios, with and without tourism benefits to local people, to judge effects on livestock numbers and household livelihoods (4). Livestock sales are increased in simulations, above the observed number of sales that is typical (5). This is an"

97,539,0.318,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","In conclusion, the chapters in this volume provide a compelling account of the increasing evidence of the multiple benefits provided by NBS in combatting climate change, in particular for adapting to a changing climate coupled with increasing urbanisation. Case studies across Europe demonstrate successful implementation of the NBS concept and provide important pointers for urban planning and management. In order to further operationalise the NBS approach as effective instrument in sustainable urban development at a larger scale, we identify key remaining research challenges that can help to foster broad application in practice and policy: â¢ Assess effectiveness of NBS at different scales: The NBS impacts of ecosystem service provisions are highly scale dependent concerning space and time and linked to geographical location in the city as well as other factors such as species selection or management practices. Research should therefore identify at what scale and under which circumstances different NBS are most effective in order to evaluate their potential but also possible limitations. It is important that research is not tailored towards single ecosystem services only but takes into account the multiple benefits possibly generated by a NBS project. â¢ Consider NBS effects of urban soil management: The impact of urban soil management in urban environments, especially the contribution of unsealed soils and high organic soils both to climate mitigation through avoided carbon losses and to adaptation through increased water infiltration and evaporation capacities, needs further scientific attention. â¢ Evaluate hybrid approaches of NBS and grey infrastructure combinations: As several chapters point out, the dichotomy of employing either engineered or NBS solutions may not be useful or effective. Research should also focus on the question how NBS can complement technological solutions. This includes research that combines effects of the building sector (grey infrastructure) with ecosystem management strategies (blue and green infrastructure) in an integrative manner. â¢ Analyse cost-benefits of NBS implementation: In order to evaluate the costeffectiveness of NBS, cost-benefit analyses are needed to assess the whole range of possible multiple NBS benefits in terms of single project evaluations as well as in terms of a comparison between purely âgreyâ and âgreen and blueâ and âhybridâ options. This includes economic analyses of the costs of inaction as well as the possibility of catastrophic failure of purely technical solutions. The full range of social and economic impacts should be comprehensively taken into account by studying the monetary and non-monetary values of NBS projects. â¢ Identify causalities and mechanisms: In order to assess causalities and mechanisms of NBS effectiveness, research set-ups should include an evaluation of all relevant parameters before and after NBS implementation (pre- and post-assessment). Indicators of efficiency should be selected at the beginning of the project and respective measurements undertaken. In addition, the specific contribution"

Pakistanâs per capita water availability has reduced from 5000 to 1000 m3 since 1947 (independence of country) because of an unprecedented population growth rate that is one of the highest in Asia (Majeed and Piracha 2011). In the survey, the 71 local ofï¬cials who were aware of climate change were asked about the severity of the climate change threat to water resources. A majority of the respondents (73 %) believe that climate change is a very serious threat to the water resources of Punjab (Fig. 25.3). Only four local ofï¬cials were unaware of the severity of the climate change threat to water resources in Punjab. While only a small percentage (13 %) of respondents has a deeper understanding of climate change (Table 25.1), a large percentage is convinced of its adverse impacts on water resources.

320,39,0.318,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"The Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007a) clearly underlined the existing trend of climate change. It projected future developments with dramatic impacts, such as increasing temperature, changes in both amount and distribution of precipitation, change of the climatic water balance, and the increasing occurrences of extreme events. These changes will have serious impacts on nature (IPCC 2007b) and endanger the natural heritage that is protected within nature reserves, national parks, biosphere reserves or other protection categories. These facts are already recognised on a European policy level: âClimate change has the potential, over a period of a few decades, to undermine our efforts for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversityâ (European Commission 2006, p. 13). Current discussions connected to climate change often focus on the prevention or mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Even though mitigation of climate change is of utmost importance, protected area administrations as well as nature protection authorities also need support on the political (administration) as well as on the practical level (management) in order to cope with climate change and their adaptation to it. To preserve ecosystems, habitats, and species, as well as their goods and services, for society under changing climatic conditions it is recommended to: â¢ identify potential climate change and land use-induced threats; â¢ model regional climate change effects and their potential impacts on protected areas (see Chaps. 2 and 3); â¢ evaluate existing management practices;"
241,1293,0.318,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"This chapter assesses to what extent the factors causing global warming affect the Baltic Sea area. Summertime near-surface warming in northern Europe exceeds natural internal variability of the climate system, and the observed warming cannot be explained without human influence. Regional changes in extreme temperatures, growing-season length and timing of the onset of spring are consistent with the large-scale signal of a human influence (mainly greenhouse gases). Shifts in large-scale circulation in the Northern Hemisphere and precipitation changes in northern Europe and the Arctic have been detected to exceed natural internal variability, but the climate models used to assess these quantities seem to underestimate the observed changes. To what extent this discrepancy between simulated and observed changes also affects the attribution of regional warming to human influence is still a matter of debate. Other aspects of regional climate change including changes in storminess, snow properties, run-off and the changing physical properties of the Baltic Sea have not been formally attributed to human influence yet.

214,261,0.318,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Changing water availability affects industry and also affects agriculture. Agricultural land (pasture and cropland) has very different surface properties than natural vegetation, which can result in signiï¬cant differences in evapotranspiration, affecting precipitation, and albedo, affecting surface temperature. Changes in precipitation and temperature in turn feedback on crops: requiring changes to crop types or additional irrigation water if available. All of these feedbacks can be predicted and modeled, with varying degrees of ï¬delity. Ultimately, human systems like industry, energy, and agriculture respond to price signals from the economic system. The costs of energy and agriculture are affected by the natural environment. This is most obvious with agriculture: Rrain and temperatures strongly affect crop yields and the necessity for irrigation. Then crop yields in different regions affect overall prices for crops, the mix of crops, and ultimately the economic system. Many terrestrial systems models are starting to include complex representations of the physical side of the anthroposphere: agriculture and urban environments. Agriculture is a signiï¬cant fraction (one-third) of total land area,20 so it has a large physical effect. The effect of urban areas is signiï¬cant as well due to signiï¬cantly different albedo and evaporation characteristics of hard (nonporous) surfaces common in densely built-up areas (roofs and roads). The extent of urban area (less than 0.5 % of the total land area) is small. However, cities have a large impact because of the intensity and magnitude of their emissions. It is also important to simulate urban areas because cities are home to half of the global population. Simulation of urban environments generally starts as a discrete land surface type in a model, but it may evolve to have its own emission characteristics as well. There are many varieties of economic models. Economic models range from simple supply-and-demand curves (an economic model of a single product in a spreadsheet), to complex models of entire economies or even the global economy. Such macroeconomic or sectoral models typically have similar supply-and-demand curves for different regions of the planet and different economic activities that are interdependent, and can be solved for a solution to all these supply-and-demand equations that end up yielding predictions of economic output and prices. These economic system models encompass the Industry, Energy, and Agricultural sectors of the Human Systems box in Fig. 7.9.21 Economic models can also be coupled with the climate and environmental factors. Climate factors can alter supply-and-demand curves (crop yields based on weather, for example). The result of these feedbacks is ultimately to alter the trajectory of human systems to react to changes in the environment: If climate changes, crops may not be viable in certain regions, and the economy and society will adapt. Some regions will suffer, but other regions may beneï¬t from increased crop yields in colder climates that have warmed, and this also needs to be factored"

222,473,0.317,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Water levels in the delta are controlled by a balance between river and tidal flow, acting on different timescales. Throughout the year the situation can change, from tides controlling the water levels in the dry season to dominance by river flow during the monsoon. Some sensitivity to model bottom roughness is seen in the simulations, though the magnitude of these changes is small in the context of tidal range and seasonal water level changes associated with freshwater. Figure 17.6 shows modelled surface salinity from the baseline simulation described in Table 17.1. As there is a continuous data set from the model, the mean and maximum are calculated from the full annual data set, while Fig. 17.2 compares point observations with a modelled map for the March to May period. It may be seen that the salinity is higher in the west of the study region around the Sundarbans forest. This is because the majority of freshwater discharges occur through the eastern distributaries, especially the Meghna Estuary, and the western delta is composed mainly of tidal creeks with little or no freshwater input. In the FVCOM delta model, there is only one point of freshwater input (marked on Fig. 17.5). The network of river distributaries then carries this to the Bay of Bengal.

Climate uncertainty is one piece of information input to the policy process to help determine the built infrastructure. Other inputs would include population changes and the economics of building and maintaining the infrastructure: reservoirs, aqueducts, and pumping stations. The projections from climate models might be of sufï¬cient certainty to motivate policy changes, such as managing seasonal runoff from high mountains in order to beneï¬t human and natural systems. The long lead times to form, approve, permit, and implement a water system allow for both the accumulation of additional observational evidence as well as the improvement of modelsâto inform actual speciï¬cation of evolving infrastructure. Each problem has its own unique requirements on uncertainty, and these requirements can simplify the inherent complexity of the uncertainty sources. At least the analysis can reveal the key uncertainties. For example, a problem to be addressed in the next two decades, with a solution needed to function for the two decades after implementation (i.e., a lifetime in the next 40 years), has relatively little sensitivity to the carbon dioxide emission scenario. A problem requiring speciï¬c knowledge of Arctic sea ice in the next 20 years relies on model components that have strong sensitivity to the initial state (ocean currents), a rapidly changing physical environment (melting ice changes radiative forcing), and complex multi-scale physics that are not especially well represented (see discussion in Chap. 11, and Fig. 11.6). The more speciï¬c the application, the easier it might be to characterize the key uncertainties. If the application is to estimate sea ice to determine the feasibility of shipping routes in certain seasons in the Arctic, then the key features are narrowed to a season, and perhaps a particular threshold (sea-ice thickness less than some threshold for which an icebreaker is available). This might lead to speciï¬c uncertain processes that govern sea ice in particular seasons. Instead of looking at all available model simulations with large uncertainty (see Fig. 11.6), a subset of models could be used. The subset of models would contain those models with a good current sea-ice thickness in a particular season. Therefore, a productive way is to step back and focus on the state of the knowledge in Fig. 11.1. This ultimately relies on fundamentals of the scientiï¬c methodâobservations, theory, simulation; the emergence of consistency among these three pillars; and reproducibility by many investigators coming from different approaches and scientiï¬c techniques. The state of knowledge is different for different processes and phenomena. It is well established, for example, that sea level will rise as the planet warms up. Our knowledge of the amount of sea-level rise remains incomplete (see Chap. 11). One way to narrow the range of knowledge is to consider how fast ice might melt and increase sea level. Estimates of the physical timescale can be combined with timescales of planning, building, operations, and maintenance to narrow the range of the incomplete knowledge. In this scenario, competing explanations are of little consequence to practitioners. Placing the problem in"
364,76,0.317,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Global warming due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is currently receiving consider-able attention worldwide. The impact of human activities on the atmosphere and the accompanying risk of long-term climate change on a global-scale are by now familiar topics to many people (Paustian et al. 2006). Global temperature rose 0.6 Â°C during the twentieth century, and is projected to increase by 1.5â5.8 Â°C during the twenty-first century. Historical records clearly show an accelerating increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations over the past 150 years (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2001). This is attributed to the advance of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, in particular, due to the anthropogenic activities. Among the greenhouse gases, CO2 is the most important gas, accounting for 60 % of global warming (Rastogi et al. 2002; Ruddiman 2003; Lal 2007). While most of the increase is due to CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, land use and agriculture play significant roles. Overall, agricultural activities along with land use change, which predominantly occurs in the tropics, globally account for about one-third of the warming effect from increased GHG concentrations (Cole et al. 1997). In fact, although agriculture is its self subject to environmental risk due to global warming, ironically it is also estimated to contribute up to 20 % of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006; Haile-Mariam et al. 2008). In Indonesia specifically, agriculture, land use change, and forests combine to contribute as much as 53 % of CO2 emissions (Boer 2010). Agro-ecosystems emit CO2 emission through direct use of fossil fuels in food production, indirect use of embodied energy in inputs, and cultivation of soils that cause the loss of carbon through decomposition and erosion (Ball and Pretty 2002). The difference compared with fossil fuel based sectors, however, is that land use and agriculture have the opportunity to mitigate GHG emission through recommended management practices (RMP). Therefore, producers, scientists, and planners are faced with the challenge of increasing agricultural production without aggravating the risks of GHG emissions. In this regard, the management of soil resources in general and that of soil organic carbon (SOC) in particular, is extremely important. The worldâs soil resources may be the key factor in the creation of an effective carbon sink and mitigation of the greenhouse effect (Lal 1997). By employing RMP, agro-ecosystems can act as sinks that can both sequester carbon (C) and reduce CO2 emission (Pretty and Ball 2001; Lal 2007). Conservation tillage as a RMP can enhance SOC, thus reducing agricultureâs potential for global warming (Rastogi et al. 2002; Lal 2007; Smith 2010). In fact, in the Kyoto Climate Protocol and IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, conservation tillage is listed as an option for carbon sequestration (Sedjo et al. 1998; Eggleston et al. 2006). Worldwide adoption of CT, and particularly no-tillage, has expanded rapidly since about 1990, particularly in the United States, South American countries, and Africa (Triplett and Dick 2008). As in other countries, CT in Indonesia which generally consists of no-tillage (NT) and minimum tillage (MT), was initially promoted by a few CT researchers in the 1980âs. Farmers themselves successfully adopted"
198,6,0.317,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Climate change is one of the preeminent challenges facing the world today. The consequences of climate change manifest themselves in multiple ways, including increased variability and intensity of extreme weather events and sea level rise. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and the first ones to feel them tend to be poor people and poor countries that are most vulnerable and have the least capacities to cope with them. The search for solutions to mitigate climate change and to adapt to its consequences is urgent. Rigorous evaluation of policies, programs, and projects can help the international community to identify technical solutions, economic strategies, and social innovations that improve our ability to deal with climate change. This is the focus of the present book. The book has its genesis in the Climate-Eval Community of Practice hosted by the Independent Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility. Its overarching goal is to establish standards and norms, support capacity development, and share good practices in evaluations of climate change and development. In November 2014, Climate-Eval with its partners organized the Second International Conference on Evaluating Climate Change and Development in Washington, D.C. The aim of this event was to promote an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and methods to evaluate climate change and sustainable development. This 3-day event brought together some 300 leading experts and policymakers in the field and included sessions on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and policy, as well as special sessions such as panel discussions and roundtables. Topics discussed ranged from theory of change approaches to evaluation and institutional capacity; to disaster risk reduction, resilience, and tracking adaptation; to monitoring and evaluation of ecosystem-based and natural resource management interventions and climate change funds. Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development builds upon a selection of the most relevant and practical papers and presentations given at the 2014 conference. Following the conference, the editors and the authors worked closely together to develop the presentations into a coherent set of articles organized around the three main themes of climate change evaluation: policy,"

Once treated, water can be stored and distributed within the urban area, usually through a network of storage tanks and pipes. Pipe flows in urban distribution systems should be under pressure to prevent contamination from groundwater leakage and to meet ï¬re protection and other user requirements. After use, the âwastewaterâ is collected in a network of sewers, or in some cases ditches, leading to a wastewater treatment plant or discharge site. Wastewater treatment plants remove some of the impurities in the wastewater before discharging it into receiving water bodies or on land surfaces. Water bodies receiving effluents from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants may also receive runoff from the surrounding watershed area during storm events. The discharge of point and nonpoint pollutants into receiving water bodies can impact the quality of the water in those receiving water bodies. The fate and transport of these pollutants in water bodies can be predicted using water quality models similar to those discussed in Chap. 10. This chapter briefly describes these urban water system components and reviews some of the general assumptions incorporated into optimization and simulation models used to plan and manage urban water infrastructure systems. The focus of urban water systems modeling is mainly on the prediction and management of quantity and quality of flows and pressure heads in water distribution networks, wastewater flows in gravity sewer networks, and on the design efï¬ciencies of water and wastewater treatment plants. Other models can be used for the real-time operation of various components of urban systems."
365,723,0.316,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"sometimes referred to as Zambiaâs maize belt, as almost half of all maize produced in the country is grown in twelve of its districts (MAL 2007). AER IIa is also recognized as a vulnerable area. About 41% of Zambian farm households live in this region and are mostly engaged in crop production.3 The area is characterized by a semi-arid climate, where maize yields are projected to decrease significantly as a result of increased frequency of droughts and hot days and nights based on countryspecific climate change models (Kanyanga et al. 2013). Given the sampling frame of the data and evidence of expected benefits of the practices analyzed here under climate change,4 we focus our analysis only on AER IIa. Moreover, given the key importance of maize for food and nutrition security in the country (MAL 2007), we restrict our sample to maize producers, resulting in a subset of 487 households. The heterogeneity of the farm populations means that vulnerability is expected to differ significantly between households. To capture vulnerability differences that are relevant to policy choices, it is convenient to identify segments of the household population with common attributes, and to conduct analysis for these farmer groups. Cluster analysis provides a method to identify the appropriate number and description of farmer typologies (Acosta-Michlik and Espaldon 2008). We conduct our analysis for two types of smallholder households that were clearly identified based on cluster analysis: (i) smaller farms with few assets (hypothesized to be more vulnerable), and (ii) larger farms with more assets (hypothesized to be less vulnerable). We first conduct analyses of means to detect differences between the probability distributions of the production methods (CONV and MSD) between these two farm types. Variables analyzed include maize yields, labor use, fertilizer use, cash inputs, profits and returns to labor. Given the baselines obtained from the analysis of household types (low and high vulnerability) and production systems (CONV and MSD) it was clear that there are two distinct types of MSD applications in the sample: one that relies mostly on labor (using hand hoes to dig planting basins/potholes) and another that uses capital (oxen or machinery) for ripping. We denote these groups as MSD-L and MSD-K, respectively. This classification conforms with reports in the literature that find labor requirements for planting basins as one of the main constraints for the adoption of this practice in the region (Baudron et al. 2007; Mazvimavi 2011; Ngoma et al. 2014).5 No distinction regarding emphasis on capital or labor was identified in the case of CONV, which consisted of a relatively small sample."

But the coupling can be short term and more process based, such as the land surface cycling and processing of water through the surface hydrologic cycle. Precipitation falls on the land surface, and can take several pathways. Surface water can evaporate back into the atmosphere. This changes the climate in some regions by providing a water source. But subsurface water in the soil (soil moisture) can be recycled back into the atmosphere by transpiration from plants. This can directly affect the low-level atmospheric humidity, and recycle humidity, for example, back into the lower atmosphere, where it can alter cloud formation. The humidity and soil moisture can also alter the partitioning of surface fluxes between sensible heat (increasing temperature) and latent heat (increasing evaporation). Altering the local hydrologic cycle can affect short-term weather systems, or long-term climate. One storm may moisten part of a land surface. The runoff or soil moisture provides future evaporation back to the atmosphere, but it also can reduce temperatures when that evaporation occurs. On the climate scale, the moisture recycling of terrestrial systems may maintain certain climate zones. The Amazon rainforest is often called the green ocean. This is partially because rainforest plants provide a large additional source of humidity back into the atmosphere that can rapidly recycle rain back into the system. Many models do not capture this effect fully. If the Amazon exists because of these couplings between land and atmosphere, it may not be stable to large-scale disruption. Many coupled climate models have trouble maintaining the Amazon rainforest: It tends to dry out and turn to grassland if precipitation is a little too low. This highlights the importance of understanding and representing land-atmosphere coupling in global climate models."

241,807,0.315,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are causing a radiative imbalance of the Earth, which will cause the Earth to heat until thermal radiation once more balances incoming solar radiation. The majority of the extra heat retained due to the energy imbalance imposed by the emission scenario selected will be absorbed by the ocean, and as a consequence, the volume of the oceans would on average increase due to thermosteric expansion (Table 14.1). Steric expansion will be greatest in the open ocean where the water column is deepest (Landerer et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010). This would lead to a differential increase in the steric sea surface heights (SSH), which would drive a redistribution of ocean mass from the ocean interior to shallower regions (Landerer et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010). Changes in ocean circulation and in the hydrological cycle will also induce thermosteric and halosteric changes. The combined sea surface topography response is a complex spatial pattern of sea-level rise. The sea surface topography has been simulated by the ensemble of models in the CMIP3 archive (Meehl et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010; Slangen et al. 2011), but the Baltic Sea region is very poorly resolved by the majority of the models. The dynamic sea surface topography has therefore been separated into a global average steric response, and the deviation from the mean referred to as the dynamic sea level (DSL) (following Landerer et al. 2007; Meehl et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2009, 2010) depicted in Fig. 14.1. The full CMIP3 ensemble of projections will be used for the A1B global steric contribution, but for the DSL contribution in the Baltic Sea region, the calculation is restricted to the mean of three models (GFDL CM2.1; MIROC 3.2 HiRES; MPI ECHAM5) (see Fig. 14.1).

Assuming each submodel can identify a conditional probability distribution, the probability Pr{C|N} of a speciï¬ed amount of carbon, C, given some speciï¬ed loading of a nutrient, say nitrogen, N, equals the probability Pr{C|A} of that given amount of carbon given a concentration of algae biomass, A, times the probability Pr {A|N, R} of that concentration of algae biomass given the nitrogen loading, N, and the river flow, R, times the probability Pr{R} of the river flow, R.

Lessening the impacts of future drought events typically requires the development of drought risk policies that emphasize a wide range of water conservation and early warning measures. Drought management techniques are often conditional on the severity of the drought. Identifying the actions to take and the thresholds indicating when to take them are best accomplished prior to a drought, as agreements among stakeholders are easier to obtain when individuals are not having to deal with the impacts of an ongoing drought. Drought impacts can be economic, environmental, and social. Economic impacts can include direct losses to agricultural and industrial users, losses in recreation, transportation, and energy sectors. Other indirect economic impacts can include resulting unemployment and loss of tax revenue to local, state, and federal governments. Environmental losses include damages to plant and animal species in natural habitats, and reduced air and water quality; an increase in forest and range ï¬res; the degradation of landscape quality; and possible soil erosion. These losses are difï¬cult to quantify, but growing public awareness and concern for environmental quality has forced public ofï¬cials to focus greater attention on them. Social impacts can involve public safety, health, conflicts among water users, and inequities in the distribution of impacts and disaster relief programs. As with all natural hazards, the economic impacts of drought are highly variable within and among economic sectors and geographic regions, producing a complex assortment of winners and losers with the occurrence of each disaster."

The upper and lower basins have appreciably different geographies, sizes, and rainfall. Nonetheless, we applied the upstream hydrological model to the lower basin. Our assumption in doing so is that the BWI signal is designed to detect liquid water from all sources, and is defined as the percentage of the surface that is liquid water near the surface. Therefore, we explore the robustness of the model to detect that amount of water moving through the lower basin. Our hypothesis is that BWI values are a robust signal and the model parameters could effectively transcend different geographies. There was the possibility of shifting the intercept, since the lower basin is appreciably larger, and therefore its base flow should be higher. However, we wanted to minimize any tuning, in order to test the robustness of the model. The only change is the lag was reduced from 2 to 1 month, to allow for better integration (time to"
376,180,0.314,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Partitioning of Evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration is a major component of the water budget and accounts for up to 95 % of the total water input (e.g., precipitation) in rangelands (Huxman et al. 2005). It has two distinct constituents (E and T), which are controlled by different mechanisms. Partitioning of ET is important not only for better understanding the water budget but also for predicting the biogeochemical fluxes driven by hydrological variations (Wang et al. 2010a). Efficient use of the limited water resources in rangelands requires maximizing the productive water loss (T) and minimizing the unproductive water loss (E) (Wang and DâOdorico 2008). Separating E from T, however, has always been a difficult taskâespecially from the observational point of view at larger scales. A useful tool for separating E from T is stable isotopes of water, because E and T carry distinct isotopic signatures. Traditionally, the stable isotopic compositions of water samples are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), while the vapor-phase measurements are based on cryogenic water vapor collection coupled with IRMS. Such methods are labor intensive and time consuming. Over the past decade, a revolutionary change has taken place in water isotope measurement: the appearance of spectroscopy-based instruments capable of continuously measuring water vapor isotopic compositions (Fig. 3.7) (Lee et al. 2005; Wen et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009a; Griffis et al. 2010)."

TOC are key elements of CCAFSâ approach to RBM. There is no single definition of a TOC and no set methodology, as the approach assumes flexibility according to its respective user needs (Vogel 2012). A TOC provides a detailed narrative description of an impact pathway (a logical causal chain from input to impact, see Fig. 4.3) and how changes are anticipated to happen, based on underlying assumptions by the people who participated in describing these trajectories. As such they provide an ex-ante impact assessment of a programâs anticipated success.

Process-based GHG models are designed to run at source scale (e.g., site or animal) after being calibrated based on observed relationships in controlled experiments and monitoring data. Because the equations represent principal microbial, biogeochemical and physicochemical processes underlying ecosystemâatmosphere exchange processes and the emission of GHGs, the models can be suitable to simulate GHG dynamics under diverse environmental and management conditions, even conducting âwhat ifâ scenario type of experiments. The robustness of process-based models has made them a widely used predictive tool in global change studies and they might be suitable as well to account for fine scale heterogeneity in the farming context, which is not possible with current empirical models. However, process-based models need to be tested for their ability to represent GHG under specific conditions to have confidence in their predictions. This is an involved process, which restricts their utility for sites and systems outside the range of the available calibration data. Until process-based models have been adapted, calibrated, and evaluated to account for diversity and complexity characteristic of smallholder farming, their use for GHG quantification at the whole-farm level in mixed systems, such as the cropâlivestock systems of Africa, remains a challenge, requires a tight coupling of sectorial models and a whole system understanding, and implies significant uncertainty."

So it becomes a useful metric (measure) of where the system might be heading. We cover feedbacks in more detail when discussing the speciï¬c components of the climate system and how we model them in Sect. 3.2. As described in the box, there are both positive feedbacks (like the ice-albedo feedback) and negative feedbacks (like the temperature feedback) in the climate system. Put a lot of complex feedbacks together, and the climate system starts to sound less like the single screech of an electronic microphone and more like the complex tones of a symphony, perhaps one without a conductor. Many of these tones or combinations of tones have feedback loops, like the example of the sea iceâalbedo feedback described here. We discuss this feedback more in Chap. 5, after we introduce additional concepts about how the atmosphere works. To understand the climate system and how it will evolve over time, it is critical to understand these complex interactions. Most climate science is dedicated to understanding the components of the system, their coupling, and how they work now and have worked in the past, so that we can understand how they might work in the future. The imperative to understand the climate system stems solely from how society is affected by variations in high-frequency extreme weather events and lower frequency climate extremes and how they may change over time in response to different forcings within the system. Or even with no forcing of the system. The importance of understanding weather and climate is independent of any human influence. Even if we did not have reason to think the climate was changing due to human activities, it would still be important and critical to understand and simulate the climate system to predict the natural variability and potential changes in the system so that we can adjust. This is also called adaptation to climate changes, as in adapting our society to a new climate."

103,275,0.313,Solar Particle Radiation Storms Forecasting and Analysis : The Hesperia Horizon 2020 Project and Beyond (Volume 444.0),"It is important to mention that a >500 MeV SEP event is detected when the integral proton flux surpasses a certain threshold pfu500. To calculate this threshold, firstly we had to use the geometrical factors of P9, P10 and P11 proton channels provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Then, we manually varied this threshold to match each >500 MeV SEP event with each GLE event. The study ended with a threshold of 0.8 pfu, which yielded a one-to-one correspondence in 26 of the events of all 32 GLE events within the analyzed period (1986â2016). In 8 cases, a GLE was observed at Earth; however, the enhancement in >500 MeV integral proton flux did not surpass 0.8 pfu. In only one case (see Event 44.5 in Table 7.2) a >500 MeV SEP event took place, which was not observed at the ground. The UMASEP-500 modelâs parameter calibration from historical data was an optimization process whose purpose was to obtain a high POD and Advance Warning Time (AWT), and a low FAR. We found that the same thresholds and parameters found for predicting >500 MeV SEP events were also very appropriate to predict GLE events; for this reason, this section also presents a summary of the GLE forecast results. For more information about the GLE forecast results, please consult NÃºÃ±ez et al. 2017. The original purpose of the HESPERIA UMASEP-500 tool was to correlate SXR with neutron and proton data. We found that the use of proton data alone allowed this tool to make predictions before any Neutron Monitor (NM) stationâs alert. This satisfactory result became our operational criterion for classifying a GLE forecast as successful. We found that the correlation of SXR and neutron counter data did not trigger any hit additional to those generated using proton data alone. We also found that the use of neutron data provoked the generation of many false alarms due to some quality data problems (mainly spikes) caused by technical issues, such as problems in the neutron sensor tubes and power supplies, among others (Souvatzoglou et al. 2014). Since the use of neutron data did not increment the POD, but did increment the FAR, we decided not to use neutron data for making predictions. Figure 7.8 presents the forecast output for the >500 MeV and GLE event on October 28, 2003. The upper time series shows the recent >500 MeV proton flux; the predicted flux is presented with a colored curve. The middle time series shows the recent SXR flux. The plot at the bottom of the forecast output presents the empirically-estimated level of magnetic connectivity. The Automatic Prediction section (on the right) presents in red the prediction of the occurrence of the GLE event. Below, the tool presents the details of the associated flare, and the proton channels for which the SXR correlation was found. The small image at the topright shows the real evolution of the integral proton flux after this prediction. The 1-min real-time forecast outputs of this tool are shown on the website of the HESPERIA project (i.e. https://www.hesperia.astro.noa.gr/index.php/results/realtime-prediction-tools/umasep). The overall prediction performance of event occurrences for the analyzed period (1986â2016) was calculated in terms of POD, FAR and AWT.

All the variables used cannot be included in the regression for the sake of degree of freedom. Therefore, relevant regressors are chosen among the variables used to build vulnerability index through stepwise analyses. Panel specification tests are run to select the appropriate model (Baltagi 2008). Land tenure security is expected to negatively and significantly influence vulnerability to climate shocks. It should be noted that the variable capturing land tenure may be endogenous. Therefore, this chapter accounts for this likely endogeneity and use as instruments the departments in which the communities belong. Indeed, land tenure may vary with respect to the geographic settings. Moreover, every model has to be tested for sensitivity and uncertainty. A Monte Carlo analysis (Metropolis and Ulam 1949) is performed to assess the uncertainty within the vulnerability index calculation model. Monte Carlo method calculates new results by relying on repetitive random sampling (Metropolis and Ulam 1949). The sensitivity of the vulnerability indicator to any variability in the input dataset is investigated through the change and omission of certain indicators."
157,163,0.313,"The Economy as a Complex Spatial System : Macro, Meso and Micro Perspectives","1 Introduction and Motivation Nowadays, the dominant paradigm in spatial econometrics is still a parametric one. The first generation of spatial econometric models (essentially developed to handle crosssectional data) focused on modeling spatial dependence (or spatial spillover effects) through different alternative linear specifications, such as the Spatial Lag or Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR), the Spatial Error Model (SEM), the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), the Spatial Autoregressive in X-variables Model (SLX), and a mix of SAR and SEM (SAC or SARAR) (Anselin 1988; LeSage and Pace 2009). We may call this collection of econometric tools as âeconometrics of interactionâ, since they can be applied to any kind of network relationship among different sample units. During the last decade, these models have been extended to handle spatial panel data (or spatio-temporal data), that is data containing time series observations of a number of geographical units. Elhorst (2014b) defines them second generation spatial econometric models. By including a regional specific fixed or random effect, these models prove to be particularly useful to control for unobserved spatial heterogeneity, that is a fundamental task in empirical economic analyses, as failing to do so can introduce omitted-variable biases and preclude causal inference. Moreover, spatial dependence may simply be the consequence of (spatially correlated) omitted variables rather than being the result of spillovers. Thus, controlling both for spatial dependence (through c The Author(s) 2018 P. Commendatore et al.

Although our understanding of the underlying processes is limited and quantitative estimates are scarce, the physical processes are thought to result in a net sink for tropospheric CO2 during sea ice formation in the polar oceans. Recently, Rysgaard et al. (2011) estimated the net influx of CO2 into the polar oceans at 33 Tg C year 1, a flux resulting from the rejection of carbon from the ice crystal matrix during winter and subsequent formation of a surface layer of melt-water, undersaturated in CO2 during summer. The sink would be much stronger (83 Tg C year 1), if CaCO3 crystals form in the sea ice. Omar et al. (2005) suggested a wintertime CO2 sink of 5.2 g C m 2 associated with the formation of seasonal sea ice and brine rejection in the Arctic. With a seasonal sea ice extent of 14  106 km2 (in 2005) this translated into a wintertime sink of 36 Tg C year 1, which is on the higher end of estimates of 14 Tg C year 1 (no CaCO3 precipitation) and 31 Tg C year 1 (with CaCO3 precipitation) for the Arctic Ocean by Rysgaard et al. (2011). Sea ice related tropospheric CO2 uptake was estimated as 19 Tg C year 1 for the Southern Ocean, which would increase to 52 Tg C year 1, if CaCO3 crystals form in the ice (Rysgaard et al. 2011). Oceanic CO2 uptake during the seasonal cycle of sea ice growth and decay is thus equivalent to 17â42 % of net tropospheric CO2 uptake in ice-free polar seas (Rysgaard et al. 2011)."

They may have detailed representations of the ocean floor topography, often near coastlines. A commonly used type of global ocean model seeks only to represent surface processes, and the fast communication of the ocean with the rest of the climate system. These are global mixed-layer ocean models (sometimes referred to as âslabâ ocean models). Mixed-layer ocean models are global in scope, representing all ocean basins, but they are focused on the upper ocean, not the deep ocean, that is, the region above the pycnocline in the mixed layer in Fig. 6.1. The advantage of mixed-layer ocean models for simulating the climate system is that they contain smaller amounts of water mass (from 10 to several hundred meters deep). Like the limited area models described earlier, these models have a limited area, but here the limit is in depth. The models typically have no circulation but are simply an energy balance equation: The temperature of a ï¬xed-depth layer is determined by the heat and water coming in and out at the surface, and the speciï¬ed heat from a bottom boundary. They do not include currents or water motions. A mixed-layer ocean model just adjusts the temperature of the slab of water to respond to the surface energy budget from the atmosphere, and an assumed interaction with the deep ocean below. Mixed-layer ocean models need to have a bottom boundary condition, usually a speciï¬ed movement of heat to and from the unresolved deep ocean below. Like a limited area model in the horizontal, the boundary conditions often come from observations or from a more detailed ocean GCM. The models are designed to reproduce the ocean surface temperature and interact with the rest of the climate system given a speciï¬ed ocean circulation pattern below. The advantage of this conï¬guration is that it reduces the heat capacity of the ocean and allows it to come into balance much faster: decades rather than centuries. The disadvantage of mixed-layer ocean models is that they require a ï¬xed assumption about the ocean circulation, so if the climate is too different from what is assumed by the speciï¬ed energy transfer from the deep ocean, the ocean model"
221,408,0.311,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"As mentioned above, the first WGIA in 2003 had 27 participants, which rose to 130 in 2012. The latest WGIA (WGIA12) in 2014 had a participation of 123, from 14 WGIA member countries and international organisations in 2014. WGIA has become one of the biggest events on climate change in Asia. Requests have even been received from non-member countries, such as Pakistan and East Timor, to join future workshops. As regards the size of the event, in theory it could be scaled but could suffer due to insufficient budget or capacity of GIO, the WGIA Secretariat. In the beginning, the main participants were researchers, and topics concerned the national system and technical issues of each expert. Recently though, the proportion of government officials attending has been increasing. At the latest WGIA, not only GHG inventory technical issues but also mitigation issues and regional- or city-level inventories were discussed. Many government officials and policymakers also evaluated measurements concerning climate change. Further, advanced research and development on emission factors and climate change issues in Japan have also been introduced, the research of which has been helpful in creating the GHG inventory for Asian countries. The introduction of climate change research in SE Asia has enabled collaboration between Japanese researchers and local researchers in other Asian countries. Japanese researchers became aware of the needs of WGIA countries through discussions at WGIA. Furthermore, WGIA also enables government officials to access the latest information on climate change research, which illustrates the importance of the governmentâresearch relationship. Relationships between researchers and government officials are bolstered at the GIO-held WGIA every year. Further, activities unrelated to WGIA have also been held, such as the initiation of mutual learning between Japan and Korea. Mutual learning is an opportunity to understand all the different GHG inventories and how they contribute to improving GHG inventories. Korea also mentioned that mutual learning is implemented as a form of external quality assurance in the WGIA sessions. As already described in Sect. 11.1.7, mutual learning has also been conducted between other countries in WGIA sessions every year. Lao PDR, which attended the mutual learning sessions in WGIA9 and WGIA11, also introduced a mutual learning programme that emphasises peer reviews of the LULUCF with GIO. Lao PDR commented that this enhanced both accuracy and completion of the inventory of the LULUCF sector of the Lao PDR. WGIA is financed from a budget of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan. GIO, part of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, convened the WGIA and invites researchers to discuss the technical issues of GHG inventories free of international opinion or negotiations, an environment deliberately fostered so that researches can speak freely without being hindered by governmental or international bias. This forum for free discussion was built on a relationship of mutual trust, and as it moves from country to country every year and is not solely based in Japan, this enables host countries to participate more easily. As a result WGIA can be attended by many participants, enabling face-to-face contact crucial to carrying issues forward."

The objectives, expected outcomes and priority actions are also, in some cases, closely tied to or presented as concrete projects, which, in turn, add to an unclear presentation.1 Furthermore, when we survey the scope of the portfolio of AfricaâEU collaboration projects funded by the EU Framework Programme (FP), there seems to be an imbalance between the political priorities expressed through the JAES (to the extent that these can be derived) and actual research. The lack of a clear statement of joint priorities on climate change presents a fundamental challenge to the task of assessing bi-regional climate change research projects against the stated political priorities. An attempt at highlighting some of the priority topics in the JAES can however be made by taking the priority actions listed in the action plans as representative of bi-regional priorities. Using this approach, the relevant topics on climate change emerged as: â¢ Desertification â¢ Climate information and earth observation â¢ Adaptation â¢ Forests â¢ The capacity of African negotiators â¢ Disaster risk reduction â¢ Biodiversity conservation â¢ Natural resource management â¢ Adaptation and mitigation strategies â¢ Carbon markets â¢ Climate-friendly technologies Extracting political priority topics from the action plans does, however, run the risk of excluding topics that are integrated in each priority action. For example, this could be true for a topic like water. Water is not highlighted as a priority in either of the plans. It is however mentioned as forming part of one of the activities in the African Monitoring of the Environment for Sustainable Development project (âEnhancing the African capacities for the operational monitoring of climate change and"

As in our conceptual model, farmers are assumed to have a mean-variance utility function in net profits. They choose the crop mix (up to one staple and one diversification crop) and CSA technique usage by maximizing expected utility given anticipated weather and price conditions. As noted, farmers are allowed at most one diversification crop and, for simplicity, we limit our analysis to crop shares in 10% increments. In the second stage of the simulation, net profits and total utility are calculated (using the same mean-variance utility function) using scenario-specific weather conditions. Simulated utility levels â both for anticipated utility in stage 1 and realized utility in stage 2 â are simply the sum of the simulated net profit minus the simulated variance of revenues times the coefficient of absolute risk aversion.

198,160,0.31,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"The assessment concluded that, on average, the 423 projects of Swiss international cooperation analyzed show âmoderate to strongâ effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in increasing peopleâs ability to cope with the impacts of climate change. Approximately 40 % of the portfolio was found to be strongly or very strongly effective, both in climate change mitigation (114 projects) and adaptation (121 projects). Around 50 % of the total portfolio budget was allocated to interventions assessed as moderately effective (198 projects) in terms of climate mitigation or adaptation. Only 10 % of the projects showed little or no climate benefit. Despite the geographical and cultural diversity of over 70 partner countries within the portfolio, no difference in effectiveness between the different geographical regions were identified. It has been found that climate effectiveness improved over time, with higher effectiveness scores of projects implemented after 2007. Thus the share of adaptation projects rated as highly and very highly effective increased from 23 to 66 % between the projects implemented in the periods 2000â2006 and 2007â2012. For mitigation, the increase was from 36 to 54 %. Furthermore, recent projects in the portfolio integrated climate change more explicitly into project design and the quality of design of these specific interventions improved. Finally, the creation of the SDC Global Programme on Climate Change and the development of a new thematic priority âFostering climate-friendly growthâ in SECO are signs of increased strategic importance and institutional awareness on climate change. The stock taking exercise did not identify factors of success that are specific for high climate change mitigation or adaption effectiveness. It rather concluded on general success factors such as a comprehensive project design, high stakeholder commitment and ownership, good project management to be a precondition for highly satisfactory results achievement. At the same time, the report identified several domains that proved having predominantly positive results. For mitigation they include the rehabilitation of hydropower plants, improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy and cleaner production, and improved ecosystem management. Multi-stakeholder forest management projects, biotrade-based conservation and organic farming projects create in addition to mitigation results, in many cases, also important adaptation benefits. In the adaptation field, Swissfunded interventions in the areas of risk management, disaster risk reduction (including early warning) and insurance are providing real benefits to large numbers of people in various parts of the world. Swiss contributions to several multilateral institutions show high effectiveness overall (both for mitigation and adaptation). For example, the results achieved through the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the Partnership for Market Readiness and the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund are clearly noted, with Switzerland contributing to the results through its funding alongside expertise and strategic guidance."
32,212,0.31,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Social Modeling and Simulation, plus Econophysics Colloquium 2014","Therefore the robustness of the entire system is a function of mE, not the bare E. And because NE D 1 means that the average number of extinctions balances with the number of inclusions in the long time average, that corresponds to the transition point of the growth behavior. In other words, the following self-consistent condition should be satisfied for the critical number of interactions per species: m E.m / D 1. Let us now focus on the relevant parameter in the argument p above, mE. We find that the decrease of E is slower than 1=m (roughly  1= m). Therefore mE is a sub-linearly increasing function of m, and it crosses the critical value 1 around m D 13. This means that the mean-filed treatment can explain the transition in the growth behavior of the system. In addition, this theory give us the simple understanding of the transition mechanism. It originates from the balance of the two effects: although having more interactions makes each species robust against the disturbances (addition and extinction of the species relating to that species), it also increases the impact of the loss of a species. In consistent with this success in explaining the transition by the mean-field analysis, we can find essentially same phase diagram in slightly modified models, such as the model with giving a randomly distributed degrees for the newly added species, the one with different distribution functions for the link weights, and so on [11]. In the classical diversity-stability relation based on the linear stability of dynamical systems, an intrinsic stability is assumed for each element to ensure the stability of each element when that has no interactions. For the system to remain stable, each element may have essentially only one interaction that is not weak comparing to the given intrinsic stability [2]. In the present mechanism, we do not assume any kind of intrinsic stability to the elements: an element with no interaction immediately goes extinct. Even so, the system with 10 or more interactions per element can grow. In this sense, the condition we have identified is very realistic. Indeed in the real systems, it is quite often to find moderately sparse networks: the average degree is in the order of 10, not order of 1, and that seems not dependent on the system size. This novel relation between the connection in the system and its robustness might be a origin of this."
344,211,0.31,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"estimated separately. The nutrition module is also not set up to deal with relative price changes (i.e., only real disposable income changes are passed down to the micro-model). Relative prices are therefore implicitly assumed to be unchanged; hence the microsimulation model also disregards changes in the composition of consumption, even if the CGE modelâs demand system suggests they do change. The model is therefore more suited to analyses of growth-nutrition linkages under a âbalanced growthâ scenario where relative prices do not fluctuate too much. In essence, therefore, the combined Malawi model framework only considers the demand-side in detail; the supply-side of the nutrition story is reduced to a single measure of income change. In contrast, the Tanzania model explicitly accounts for relative price changes by using the demand system embedded in the CGE model. However, the assumption that all products are gross complements (i.e., cross-price elasticities are negative) is an important limitation of the LES, which means the model is not well suited to analyzing policy shocks leading to large fluctuations in relative prices. There are, however, some advantages to using a separately-defined demand system for calculating nutrition changes. Whereas demand elasticities in recursive-dynamic CGE models are typically not permitted to change over time, the nutrition demand elasticities in the Malawi microsimulation model are adjusted to account for changes in income levels and the associated behavioral changes (i.e., nutrient demand elasticities are updated to match those of the income cohorts the households move into as their incomes rise). Ecker et al. (2012) are thus able to demonstrate the effect when calorie and micronutrient deficiencies become less responsive to growth as prevalence rates decline over time. Maize is a widely grown crop in both Tanzania and Malawi, and hence has the potential to significantly contribute to growth and reductions in poverty and calorie deficiency. However, an important question for future research is how a maize-led growth strategy, such as the one followed in recent years in Malawi, might impact on crop diversification and nutrition outcomes across multiple nutrition indicators. The Tanzania study with its narrow focus on calories only cannot answer this question, but neither can the Malawi study, given that the supply of nutrients is not properly accounted for in the microsimulation model (as discussed). Many of the model limitations can be overcome. Several attempts are underway to introduce a more appropriate demand system into CGE models, specifically one which allows for consumer goods to be treated as genuine substitutes, or a system in which parameters and elasticities can be updated over time to reflect changing consumption behavior (i.e., in recursive-dynamic models). The ultimate aim would be to fully embed a detailed demand system in the CGE model that can be used to evaluate nutrition changes. In the meantime simple model improvements include, in the case of the Malawi model, linking both price and income changes in the CGE model with the microsimulation model, and applying the same set of demand elasticities in both models. The Tanzania model, in turn, can easily be extended to measure changes in the availability of micronutrients as well (data is already available to do so). Ultimately, these studies represent an important step towards better understanding the growth-nutrition linkages."

38,255,0.31,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Monitoring of tropical shallow reefs is conducted with near-global coverage using methods described by English et al. (1994). Considerable effort has been invested in comparing the accuracy and agreement among different methods (e.g., Leujak and Ormond 2007; Facon et al. 2016). The emerging consensus is to focus on the output variables from monitoring, rather than the methods: e.g., proportional cover for sessile taxa, abundance or density per unit area for mobile taxa and biomass, particularly for ï¬shes. This is consistent with emerging guidance on observation and indicator systems (UNESCO 2012). The principal framework for aggregating coral reef data to global levels has been the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), which was initiated in 1995. The establishment of the GCRMN coincided with the largest global impact to reefs ever recorded, the 1997â 98 El NiÃ±o event, giving strong impetus for global reporting for a decade. However funding for this level of reporting has been difï¬cult to sustain, forcing the GCRMN to focus on regional level reporting, such as in the Caribbean (Jackson et al. 2014) and currently underway in the Western Indian Ocean.

Involving stakeholders is critical to the success of the scenario process, as well as improving the acceptance and validity of the model and creating ownership of the process. As such, the scenario workshops are a key component of the stakeholder engagement within the research. It is intended that the scenarios are adaptive and continue to be iterated as new data and knowledge becomes available. The scenario development processes highlighted a number of future challenges. Identifying trends in socio-economic processes with multiple interactions and dependencies is severely limited by the current capacity to understand and represent these processes, particularly in a quantitative way (Berkhout et al. 2002; Swart et al. 2004). This is further compounded by the range of scales considered, from international cooperation and macroeconomic issues through to individual and household behaviour. Despite an increasing number of studies adopting interdisciplinary scenario development down to the regional scale, the majority of these remain focused on a sub-set of future changes (e.g. flood riskâHall et al. 2005), water resources (Soboll et al. 2011) and land use change (Baker et al. 2004; Rounsevell et al. 2005; Audsley et al. 2006), with few addressing the extent of biophysical and socio-economic changes considered in this research. In particular, there is limited evaluation of socio-economic scenarios focusing on human wellbeing and poverty (LÃ¡zÃ¡r et al. 2015). This complexity creates a challenge for effective stakeholder engagement, requiring participants from multiple sectors with sufficient time to engage in the scenario process. The workshops identified that there was generally inadequate time in a single workshop to both sufficiently explain the overall context, as well as to allow stakeholders to discuss and respond to questions and invited feedback. Hence, multiple workshops and repeated engagement are critical to better engagement. Despite these challenges, continued engagement with stakeholders throughout the scenario process is successful in developing both qualitative and quantitative plausible futures. The process has assisted in promoting dialogue about the complex dynamics influencing changes in the natural and human environment and breaking down silos between those with different expertise."

Drought control management in France is now part of the legal frameworks and procedures governing general national water management. Measures to address droughts have two primary basic aspects: crisis management through emergency actions and mean to long-term quantitative/qualitative water resources management. The former involves measures set up within the framework of the river basin management plans (SDAGE), while the latter is more related to the national plan that copes with climate issues, which is implemented through the regional climate change action plans (named SRCAE, for SchÃ©ma regional climat, air, Ã©nergie, and meaning âRegional Scheme for Climate, Air and Energyâ)."
