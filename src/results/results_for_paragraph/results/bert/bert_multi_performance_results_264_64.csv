68,33,0.613,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","2.5 Motivation James A. Middleton, Amanda Jansen and Gerald A. Goldin 2.5.1 Introduction Mathematics education has been plagued, over the years, by a kind of paradox. We teach mathematics for the public good, with the goal that all citizens be able to reason quantitatively; understand scientific, economic, and social arguments based on data; and use this understanding to make informed decisions about themselves and our collective polity. Yet in many countries, while mathematics is viewed as beneficial societally, it is not seen by a majority of students as beneficial personally. Such beliefs and norms about mathematics have hindered significant progress in democratizing access to quality mathematics teaching and learning, and even those with such access tend to avoid advanced mathematical topics and courses (Simpkins et al. 2006). This paradox is also manifest in public attitudes towards science and other mathematically intensive fields (National Science Board 2014). In our view, the root of the problem lies not in mathematics content per se. We do not regard mathematics as more difficult, more complex, or more boring in and of itself than other academic content. Rather, the norms, beliefs, and practices that have arisen over the past century and a half related to mathematics teaching, learning, and assessment, have ignored or poorly articulated the role of motivational processes in mathematics learning. This section considers the broad field of motivation in mathematics education research. We suggest that, until recently, the focus on individual motivational"

17,4,0.568,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"1 Introduction This ICME-13 Topical Survey is designed to provide an overview of contemporary research in the philosophy of mathematics education. This is a broad cluster of overlapping but at times disparate themes. In the ï¬rst instance, this publication exposes some of the problems and questions in mathematics education that the philosophy of mathematics education clariï¬es, illuminates and sometimes helps to solve. A metaphor for what is offered is a three tier pyramid. At the apex is this publication, presenting an abbreviated âproblematiqueâ of the subï¬eld, that is, the cluster of problems and issues at the heart of the area. At the next level, is the breadth of problems, issues and research results that will be shared when the group of authors of this publication meet with the âpublicâ at the ICME 13 conference in Hamburg, July 2016. Finally, at the base level is the full spread of research and its results, books, journals, papers, conference presentations and other activities that make up the subï¬eld, the philosophy of mathematics education, which is beyond the scope of this publication and conference. This publication thus briefly sketches some of the topics, problems and areas of active research (the apex) and through this point to some of what will be offered at the conference (the middle level). In doing so it serves as an introduction to the extent of the sub-ï¬eld overall, through references to current publications and classic literature (the base of the pyramid). Why the philosophy of mathematics education? What does it offer? The philosophy of any activity comprises its aims or rationale. Given our shared commitment to the teaching and learning of mathematics it is vital ask: What is the purpose of teaching and learning mathematics? What do we value in mathematics and its teaching and learning? Why do we engage in these practices and what do we"

306,16,0.564,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","It is a common opinion among researchers that the formation of geometrical concepts takes place in the different way than it does in the formation of arithmetical concepts. Tall (1995) has formulated a theory on how an individual builds up mathematical ideas. He has distinguished three main sources for creating mathematical concepts: perception, action, and reflection. These three sources are the basis for three essentially different kinds of mathematics: â¢ space and shape (geometry), based on theorizing about the (geometric) objects: we perceive and construct at increasing levels of sophistication; â¢ symbolic mathematics where actions on objects (such as counting) are symbolized giving new mathematical concepts (number); and â¢ axiomatic mathematics, built by reflection on the properties of the ï¬rst two forms of mathematics in terms of formal deï¬nitions and logical deductions (Fig. 1)."
15,27,0.559,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","The positive impact of initial successes in the course resonated in their increased confidence (Whitty 2010). Whitten interviewed six young adult learners to evaluate their beliefs, attitudes and learning histories. He identified five themes in their responses: Mathematics is a collection of discrete bits of knowledge separate from the real-world, the purpose of studying math was to complete problems correctly, understanding was peripheral to that task, the teacher is the ultimate, external authority, and listening to that authority passively represented learning mathematics (Whitten 2013). In a rich and detailed doctoral dissertation, Yuen used math histories to uncover the roots of math anxiety in adult students in a developmental class. She too found major themes that emerged from the analysis of the data, themes that echo those found by Whitten: a belief that learning math means following proscribed steps, expectations concerning the role and behaviour of an instructor, roadblocks inherent in the developmental college delivery system, a view of mathematics that is procedural rather than conceptual, importance of rote memorization of skills and prescribed steps, and the need to take control of oneâs learning. 2.2.1.2 Math Anxiety It is almost 40 years since Sheila Tobias wrote her landmark book about the phenomenon that has come to be known as âmath anxiety.â The premise of her research was the conviction that adults were unsuccessful in mathematics classes because of the presence of math anxiety rather than the absence of ability. The cited research on math histories attests to its pervasive existence. In the intervening years, many researchers in adult mathematics education have examined various facets of the phenomenon. Some, including Yuen, have suggested paths to victory for achievement over anxiety. Yuen suggest five strategies aimed at moving the adult classroom from the teacher-focused structure indicated by students to one that is more learner-centered. Her first suggestion states that students should be given active control in the learning process, Secondly, instruction should have two goals, development of conceptual understanding and then the refinement of procedures useful in similar situations. The fostering of a positive atmosphere and quashing negative, anxiety producing experiences through vigilant, open communication between instructor and students is her third recommendation. Contextualizing problems is her fourth suggestion followed by a fifth and final one, that the instructor helps students see mathematics as a logical activity that can be useful in living an adult life (Yuen 2013). For her doctoral research, Parker interviewed adults who had overcome math anxiety but had successfully overcome it because the motivation to succeed proved more powerful that the fear of the subject. She found that each individual story followed a pattern, and Parker describes the transition as a six-step journey through and beyond math anxiety: â¢ Perception of a need to become more comfortable with math â¢ Making a commitment to address the problem"
333,37,0.557,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"Since the introduction of electronic calculators in mathematics education in the 1970âs, the discussion of using those aids has been ongoing. Many studies have been conducted (cf. Barzel 2012) and many questions have been surveyed: â¢ Which speciï¬cations are necessary for designing tasks in mathematics education as well as in mathematics assessments by considering technology? â¢ How is it possible to work meaningfully in mathematics classrooms by using technology? â¢ Is it possible to raise the motivation for discussing mathematical problems by using technology in mathematics education? â¢ Where is it possible to identify mathematics in everyday life and what is the role of technology? â¢ Is it possible to form another picture of mathematics when using technology in mathematics education? â¢ How does the use of technology influence mathematical skills and competencies of students? It is beyond controversy that the use of technology broadens the palette of tools in mathematics education. By using digital tools as a black-box (cf. Buchberger 1989), complex and real problems can be discussed (cf. Rousseau and Saint Aubin 2008). Besides real-life applications, problems of everyday life that do not have an explicit connection to mathematics can be discussed (cf. Siller 2015). Meaningful questions like evacuating a special region or a football stadium, ï¬nding the optimal path on a mountain or position-planning can be discussed because the complex mathematical part and the mathematical solution can be outsourced to technology. There are only the personal requirements of identifying and understanding mathematical connections and applying mathematical skills. These are the (new) challenges in mathematics education. Laborde (2002, p. 285) writes: When a new element such as technology is introduced, the system is perturbed and has to make choices to ensure a new equilibrium is attained, choices that may be related to the various interrelated elements of the teaching system mentioned [â¦]."
333,15,0.55,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"thinking and inquiry on one hand and the symbolic system on the other. This is possible because they have internalized the system so thoroughly that they are able to mentally simulate it as a dynamic ï¬eld of potential, enabling them to engage in âwhat-ifâ interactions of an exploratory, conversational form. In mathematics, this ability is particularly powerful, because of the dependence on representations that we have described above. We will describe several classes of technology environments that provide dynamic and/or socially-distributed interfaces with important representational systems in mathematics. These environments offer the potential for learners (even very young learners) to enter into a relationship with those systems, which we describe as co-action. We argue that the experience of relationships of co-action with mathematical structures can contribute to a transformative educational program. Of course, we do not argue that a technology that opens a possibility for co-action is sufï¬cient in itself to give learners access to mathematical understandings that were the hard-won rewards of a lifetime of study for mathematicians of the past. However, we do suggest that carefully planned educational experiences with such environments can remove barriers to broader participation in a culture of mathematical literacy and fluency. Extreme care is necessary here, as the long history of teaching and learning with static representations should not be ignored in the work to envision its future successor. Instead, we must proceed by pondering how digital and socially distributed representations of mathematical entities can contribute in new ways to genuine mathematical understanding. We see digital and shared representations as capable of adding dimensions to static representational systems and further improving the cycle of: exploration, conjecture, explanation, and justiï¬cation. Moreover, as educational systems incorporate such environments and experiences, traditional pathways of learningâwill gradually give way to new cultural and institutional structures that realize the potential of these innovations. In the sections below, we give two brief examples of co-action, one emphasizing dynamic representations, and the other highlighting socially distributed representations."

Also several of the studies were repeated in at least two of the sections due to the nature of the factors that were studied. It is difï¬cult to write about teacher knowledge without some acknowledgment of how knowledge or lack of knowledge can impact teachersâ mathematics identities. Furthermore, ï¬eld experiences are contexts in which PSMTsâ knowledge and identities are impacted and shaped. In addition, the survey revealed that mathematics education researchers are thinking more deeply about how to foster the growth of effective mathematics teachers in a myriad of ways.

317,45,0.539,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"these issues comes from research that has analyzed the forms and functions of mathematical activity in remote, indigenous, non-Western cultures where no systematic transmission in school prevails. Illustrative for this perspective is are Saxeâs (2015) in-depth analyses of the Oksapmin numeration system based on body parts and of how certain changing socio-economic conditions (such as increased participation in economic exchanges involving currency) lead to important adaptations in that system. A second perspective involves analyses of informal mathematical practices that are embedded in speciï¬c out-of-school activities and contexts that may be contrasted with âschool mathematics,â as in the famous pioneering study of Brazilian street venders (see Nunes 1992). Continuing efforts have further contributed to our insight into the forms and social functions of mathematical activity demonstrated by people in varied out-of-school or, more speciï¬cally, work contexts such as carpet laying, interior design, retailing, restaurant management, dietetics, newspaper selling, nursing, banking, and architecture. These everyday math studies show that these forms and functions of mathematical activity are quite different from those of school mathematics, as they are âembodied in expressive forms and bodily modalities, distributed to other people and technologies, and are embedded in the language of the localsâ (Reed 2013, p. 75). While many of these analyses have focused on how people perform certain tasks, others have focused more on the mathematics learning processes in those out-of-school environments, showing that mathematics learning is certainly not limited to acquisition of the mathematical knowledge and skills passed down by mathematics teachers to individuals via school, but that it occurs as well during participation in cultural practices as people attempt to accomplish pragmatic goals. More speciï¬cally, these studies contributed to the view of mathematics learning in many of these out-of-school environments as âa centripetal movement of the apprentice from the periphery to the center of practice, under the guidance of those who are already masters in that practiceâ (Presmeg 2007, p. 444). Many of these analyses of out-of-school mathematical practices and learning environments involve more or less explicit contrasts between doing and learning mathematics in these out-of-school contexts versus formal school contexts, glamorizing the former as more âauthentic,â âmeaningful,â âflexible,â and/or âeffectiveâ than the latter. However, during the past decades, better understanding of the similarities and differences between these different contexts of mathematical (learning) practices has increasingly discouraged researchers and educators from making caricature-like characterizations of these different contexts of mathematical practices and, consequently, oversimpliï¬ed recommendations for implementing features of these informal mathematical practices into mathematics classroom contexts. Second, researchers have analyzed peopleâs use of their mathematical knowledge and skills acquired in one context when functioning in the other. This analysis can be done in both directions. As far as the transition from school to out-of-school mathematics is concerned, many researchers have documentedâfor elementary school up to universityâ (traditionally schooled) learnersâ difï¬culties in spontaneously and efï¬ciently"

For example, recent investigations (e.g., Chernoff 2012a, b) have gone back to their proverbial roots and integrated recent developments to the heuristics and biases program, which attempts to deal with the âarrested development of the representativeness heuristic in the field of mathematics educationâ (Chernoff 2012a, p. 951). Similar investigations embracing research from other fields have opened the door to alternative views of heuristics, intuitions, and learning difficulties, such as in the work by Gigerenzer and the Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) Group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin (e.g., Gigerenzer et al. 2011). Based on these developments, the field of mathematics education is starting to also develop particular research which is building upon and questioning certain aspects of probabilistic intuitions and learning difficulties. For example, Chernoff, in a recent string of studies (e.g., Chernoff 2012a, b; Chernoff and Zazkis 2011), has begun to establish that perhaps normatively incorrect responses to a variety of probabilistic tasks are best accounted for not by heuristics or informal reasoning, but rather participantsâ use of logical fallacies. In considering how students reason about probability, advances in technology and other educational resources have allowed for another important area of research, as described in the next section."
210,28,0.534,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"7 Final Remarks Research continues to show that the PSMT knowledge of mathematical content and processes is plagued with difï¬culties and low conceptual understanding of many concepts. However, the studies do not stem from a common framework regarding what must be required from prospective secondary teachers, and requirements established by researchers seems to vary in nature and depth. In this area, an important step forward would be the establishment of such frameworks (as suggested by Speer et al. 2015) and a common understanding of important steps in the development in PSMT mathematical knowledge (learning frameworks). Concerning knowledge of mathematics teaching, didactical knowledge or PCK, we seem to have an even more precarious situation, given the scarce number of studies in the ï¬eld and the fuzziness that still accompanies this notion. As the work of Kaarstein (2015) showed, PCK is an elusive notion, and its distinction of mathematics knowledge is often problematic. The large-scale national and international studies on teacher knowledge also point towards a very complex relation between PCK and CK. The studies on the impact of teacher education practices and the processes of how PSMT knowledge develops in teacher education programs suggest that the active engagement of participants in doing mathematics and discussing strategies and results has a positive influence in their mathematics learning. In addition, PSMT active engagement in preparing tasks, analyzing studentsâ work, giving feedback to students, and discussing with colleagues and teacher educators are also positive influences on their knowledge about mathematics teaching. Looking closely at studentsâ thinking is a major trend in the research carried out in the last ten years and may have an important impact on PSMT learning. When they are in ï¬eldwork placements, ICT may be a useful means for communication and interaction. For dealing with speciï¬c topics, we will probably need local theories that indicate what kinds of tasks, materials and environments promote a stronger development. Moreover, taking into account the complexity of mathematics teaching, we need to extend our teacher education practices into directions so that this complexity becomes transparent to PSMT. Addressing complexity in teacher education challenges researchers and educators to consider PSMT knowledge and its development under new more participatory theoretical perspectives."
17,12,0.529,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"The above ï¬ve questions and their concomitant sub-questions might be taken to represent a âbottom upâ introduction to the philosophy in mathematics education, because they start with, interrogate and problematise the practices of teaching and learning mathematics and related issues. A âtop downâ approach might use instead the abstract branches of philosophy to provide the conceptual framework for analysis. Thus it could consider research and theory in mathematics education according to whether it draws on ontology and metaphysics; epistemology and learning theory; social and political philosophy; aesthetics, ethics and axiology (the philosophy of values) more generally; the methodology of mathematics education research; or other branches of philosophy. Ontology and metaphysics have as yet been little applied in mathematics education research (Ernest 2012). Work drawing on aesthetics is still in its infancy (Ernest 2013, 2015; Sinclair 2008). However extensive uses of epistemology and learning theory, social and political philosophy, ethics and methodology can be found in mathematics education research and literature. In addition to the contributions of the substantive branches of philosophy to mathematics education, there are also beneï¬ts to be gained from applying philosophical styles of thinking in our research. For example, many of the constructs we utilise need careful conceptual analysis and critique. I have in mind such widely used ideas as understanding, development, progress, progressivism, mathematical ability, nature/natural, cultural/artiï¬cial, values, objectivity/subjectivity, identity, working like a mathematician, learning, discovery learning, problem solving (including pure, applied, ârealâ and âauthenticâ problems), teaching, assessment, mathematics, knowledge, sex/gender, special needs in mathematics, multiculturalism/antiracism, ethnomathematics, context, both social and task-related, and so on. Understanding is perhaps the most basic and obvious of these terms, so what can deconstructing it add to our knowledge? Can it contain hidden assumptions and pitfalls? First of all, it is based on the peculiar metaphor of âstanding underâ. In what way does this capture its meaning? Synonyms like âgraspingâ, âgetting a handle onâ or âseeingâ it are all based on familiarity through a sensory encounter with meaning,"

Therefore, involving adults (parents) in mathematics education of their children will be a win-win situation.

Besides, this involvement will also make them more committed and eager to become a lifelong mathematics learner and practitioner."

Likewise, it provides information about research done regarding ways to pose new problems and about the need for teachers to develop abilities to handle complex situations in problem posing contexts. Singer et al. (2013) identify new directions in problem posing research that go from problem-posing task design to the development of problem-posing frameworks to structure and guide teachers and studentsâ problem posing experiences. In a chapter of this book, Leikin refers to three different types of problem posing activities, associated with school mathematics research: (a) problem posing through proving; (b) problem posing for investigation; and (c) problem posing through investigation. This classiï¬cation becomes evident in the problems posed in a course for prospective secondary school mathematics teachers by using a dynamic geometry environment. Prospective teachers posed over 25 new problems, several of which are discussed in the article. The author considers that, by developing this type of problem posing activities, prospective mathematics teachers may pose different problems related to a geometric object, prepare more interesting lessons for their students, and thus gradually develop their mathematical competence and their creativity."
17,23,0.521,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"Recent developments of critical mathematics education are, for instance, formulated in AlrÃ¸ et al. (2010), Ernest et al. (2015) and Skovsmose and Greer (2012). Looking into the future much more is on its way. Let me just refer to some doctoral studies in progress that I am familiar with. Ana Carolina Faustino addresses dialogical processes in primary mathematics education. Not least inspired by the work of Freire, dialogic education has developed with many references to adult education. However, Faustino is going to rework the very conception of dialogue with particular reference to younger children. Amanda Queiroz Moura investigates mathematics education for deaf students. This brings her to address particular aspects of inclusive education as well as of dialogical education, and in this way to provide new dimensions to the discussion for mathematics education for social justice. JoÃ£o Luiz Muzinatti works with middle class students, and through different mathematical projects he is challenging a range of assumptions and preconceptions that dominate middle class discourses. Thus Muzinatti formulates new concerns of critical mathematics education. Guilherme Henrique Gomes da Silva addresses afï¬rmative actions. He investigates the different components of such actions, emphasising that afï¬rmative actions also must address the very educational format of university studies. This way da Silva brings a new speciï¬city to the discussion of afï¬rmative actions. We always have to remember that much research in mathematics education is not presented in English, but in other languages. The same applies to critical mathematics education. Here one ï¬nds important contribution in Portuguese as, for instance, Biotto Filho (2015), Marcone (2015) and Milani (2015). (See also, Skovsmose 2001, 2007, 2008; Valero and Skovsmose 2012.)"
342,4,0.52,Semiotics in Mathematics Education,"objects of mathematics are ideal, general in nature, and to represent themâto others and to oneselfâand to work with them, it is necessary to employ sign vehicles,1 which are not the mathematical objects themselves but stand for them in some way. An elementary example is a drawing of a triangleâwhich is always a particular caseâbut which may be used to stand for triangles in general (Radford 2006a). As a text on the origin of (Euclidean) geometry suggests, the mathematical concepts are the result of the continuing reï¬nement of physical objects Greek craftsmen were able to produce (Husserl 1939). For example, craftsmen were producing rolling things called in Greek kulindros (roller), which led to the mathematical notion of the cylinder, a limit object that does not bear any of the imperfections that a material object will have. Childrenâs real problems are in moving from the material things they use in their mathematic classes to the mathematical things (Roth 2011). This principle of âseeing an A as a Bâ (Otte 2006; Wartofsky 1968) is by no means straightforward and directly affects the learning processes of mathematics at all levels (Presmeg 1992, 2006a; Radford 2002a). Thus semiotics, in several traditional frameworks, has the potential to serve as a powerful theoretical lens in investigating diverse topics in mathematics education research."

333,3,0.515,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"1 Introduction The use of technology in upper secondary mathematics education is a multifaceted topic. This topical survey addresses several dimensions of the topic and attempts at referring to international research studies as it is written by a team of several authors from ï¬ve countries of three different continents. The survey is structured into four subchapters, each of them addressing a theme of the TSG 43 at ICME 13. â¢ Technology in secondary mathematics education: theory Technology is often arousing enthusiasm as well as reluctance among teachers and mathematics educators. Therefore it was necessary to start the survey with a theoretical analysis of features of digital technologies from an epistemological and a cognitive perspective. A unique epistemological feature of mathematics is their symbolic dimension. It is impossible to gain direct access to mathematical objects as to physical objects. The only way is to access them is through representations. Digital technologies mediate mathematics and some of them offer new kinds of representations, like dynamic and socially distributed representations. Based on a Vygostkian perspective and an instrumentation approach, the use of digital technologies is analyzed as a coaction or a creative interplay between tool and human and as social coaction with socially distributed technology. This theoretical analysis is presented in the ï¬rst subchapter and the second subchapter also refers to it. â¢ The role of new technologies: changing interactions Part of the role of new technologies is to change the process toward an outcome for learning. This process includes developing a mathematical discourse, providing opportunities to conjecture and test, and active not passive learning. New technologies can add to these processes by connecting learners in different ways with each other and the phenomena under study, mediating learning in different ways, and can offer the opportunity for students to build on the work of one Â© The Author(s) 2017 S.

306,25,0.515,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","instruments used (e.g., rulers, compasses) and the respective geometrical conï¬gurations, and a discursive process producing arguments and proofsâ (Kuzniak and Nechache 2015, p. 545). Recently, research in mathematics education has turned its attention to the problem of âlanguage and semiotic aspects in the construction of mathematical knowledge, both in an individual and in a social construction perspectiveâ (Boero and Consogno 2007). In particular, starting from the assumption that the language is fundamental since the mathematical objects are not directly accessible Duval (1993), elaborated a theory based on this main idea: the learning of mathematical objects is necessarily conceptual and an activity on them is possible only using âregisters of semiotic representationsâ (Duval 1993). He provides a very rich theory about it based on the assumption that there is no knowledge without representation. Moreover, two kinds of transformations are mathematically relevant: the âtreatmentâ (Duval 1993, p. 41), the transition from a representation to another in the same register, and the âconversionâ (Duval 1993, p. 421), the transition from a representation in a register to another in a different register. The transition from a semiotic representation to another and vice versa is essential for the conceptual learning of mathematical objects: âThinking in mathematics depends on the synergy of several registers and not on the activity of a single system. Unlike what occurs in other ï¬elds, mathematical concepts are only understandable within such a synergyâ (Duval 2006, p. 21). Duval (2005) afï¬rms that geometry requires a cognitive activity very complex but complete, since it stimulates the gesture, the language, and the seeing. It is a ï¬eld of knowledge that implies the cognitive joining of two very different representation registers: the visualization of the shapes and the language; a synergy between visualization and language is fundamental to understand geometrical arguments. Duval (2005) identiï¬es the origin of the difï¬culties in geometry in the intuition which relies on perception. According to psychological studies, perception plays a fundamental role in the visualisation process: âBy perception the visual thought organises itself as a starting point of insight and reflection, mental activities which contribute to the formation of conceptsâ (Marchini et al. 2009, p. 62). Perception is a process of selection and organization, cognitive activities connected with knowledge and understanding. Nevertheless, visual perception may hinder the way of seeing geometrical ï¬gures. Following Duval (2005), this way depends on the activity in which it is involved. There are two ways of seeing a ï¬gure: iconic and not iconic. The second is a sequence of operations of geometrical property identiï¬cation that implies that the âdeconstructionâ of the shapes has been visually recognized. This brief overview of theories that underlie geometrical knowledge has been focused mainly on those elements that affect research conducted at the lowest educational level. However, even such a selective approach shows that theoretical background can be varied, taking into account many different aspects of building the geometrical knowledge of students. It also shows the speciï¬cs of the geometric research that distinguish it from research in other areas of education."
306,70,0.513,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Results of research related to secondary school pupilsâ conceptions of geometrical objects and relationships show that this knowledge is not well established. One of the reasons is the very poor recognition of the way geometric knowledge develops in the early educational stages. Fortunately, research related to early geometry has started to become increasingly important. This has happened in parallel with the conscious return of the teaching of early geometry in schools. Without denying the relevance of understanding numbers and operations for young students, it is essential to highlight the increasing role of geometric reasoning and examine its speciï¬city. Traditionally, the ï¬rst geometric phenomena presented have concerned the recognition and study of shapes, but there is also a need to pay attention to the relationship between shapes and their functioning in space. This opens up new ï¬elds of research, which also include educational aspects of geometry at the lowest educational levels. In addition, this draws attention to the need to create new theoretical foundations. These, in turn, call for consideration in geometric reasoning and affect both the research related to geometric phenomena other than what has been analysed before and the design of teaching. Geometry in a patterns environment can lead a child to the philosophy of mathematical thinking: â¢ from perception to deï¬nition and mathematical formulation and â¢ in ï¬nding the general in the particular. Research into childrenâs reasoning has shown that they are able to perceive a general rule and feel the universality of certain mathematical relationships and that these ï¬ndings are accompanied by deep emotions. We emphasize here that these tasks lead to conjecture and hypotheses and sensitize the relationships between concepts and teaching how to use these compounds. They provide an opportunity for achieving higher goals in mathematical education: reasoning, communicating mathematically, and using mathematical thinking, both in facts and skills or"
342,39,0.511,Semiotics in Mathematics Education,"The summary of influential semiotic theories conducted in the previous section provided an idea of the impact of these theories in mathematics education. In this section we discuss in more detail the impact that semiotics has had in speciï¬c problems of mathematics teaching and learning. As previously mentioned, two different approaches can be distinguished within semiotics, depending on how signs are conceptualized: a representational one, in which signs are essentially representation devices, and one in which signs are conceptualized as mediating tools (Radford 2014b). There is still a third approachâ a dialectical materialist oneâin which signs and artefacts are a fundamental part of mathematical activity, yet they do not represent knowledge, nor do they mediate it (Radford 2012). This is the approach to signs, artifacts, and material culture in general that is featured in the theory of objectiï¬cation (Radford 2006b, 2008b, 2013b, 2015a, b). Such a conception of signs and artefacts is consubstantial with the conception of the dialectical materialist idea of activity. This conception of activity is very different from usual conceptions that reduce activity to a series of actions that an individual performs in the attainment of his or her goal. The latter line of thinking reduces activity to a functional conception: activity amounts to the deeds and doings of the individuals. Activity in the theory of objectiï¬cation does not merely mean to do something. Activity (TÃ¤tigkeit in German and deyatelânostâ"

88,3,0.503,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"The ï¬eld of mathematics education also sees international comparative studies as a means to generate theories and to identify practices that may improve studentsâ learning. According to Cai (1995), international comparative studies in the domain of mathematics provide mathematics educators with opportunities to identify effective ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Examination of what is happening in the learning of mathematics in other countries helps researchers and educators understand how mathematics is taught by teachers and how it is learned and performed by students in different countries. It also helps them reflect on theories and practices of teaching and learning mathematics in their own culture. Stigler et al. (2000), themselves researchers conducting international studies, explain the value of this research on trends over time and context in a more nuanced Consequently, we may be blind to some of the most signiï¬cant features that characterize teaching in our own culture because we take them for granted as the way things are and ought to be. Cross-cultural comparison is a powerful way to unveil unnoticed but ubiquitous practices (pp. 86â87)."
227,54,0.502,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Conceptual frameworks used to explain learnersâ construction of mathematical knowledge need to capture or take into account the different ways of reasoning that students might develop as a result of using a set of tools during the learning experiences. Figure 9 show some digital technologies that learners can use for speciï¬c purpose at the different stages of problem solving activities. The use of a dynamic system (GeoGebra) provides a set of affordances for learners to conceptualize and represent mathematical objects and tasks dynamically. In this process, affordances such as moving objects orderly (dragging), ï¬nding loci of objects, quantifying objects attributes (lengths, areas, angles, etc.), using sliders to vary parameters, and examining family of objects became important to look for invariance or objects relationships. Likewise, analysing the parameters or objects behaviours within the conï¬guration might lead learners to identify properties to support emerging mathematical relations. Thus, with the use of the tool, learners might conceptualize mathematical tasks as an opportunity for them to engage in mathematical activities that include constructing dynamic models of tasks, formulating conjectures, and always looking for different arguments to support them. Similarly, learners can use an online platform to share their ideas, problem solutions"
210,51,0.502,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"Three of the four studies that constituted this group investigated the relationships between the development of PSMTsâ identities and the learning of speciï¬c mathematical topics during pre-service education. In the fourth study the researchers sought to develop a theoretical framework for investigating a particularly situated identity of mathematics teachers: their identity as embedders-of-numeracy. GonÃ§alves Costa and Pamplona (2011) analyzed the opportunities that pre-service education offers to PSMTs for developing their identities as statistical educators. Drawing on a situated learning perspective, the authors used the notion of participation in CoPs for describing and analyzing the curricular transformation of a mathematics education degree program. This study highlighted that in order for PSMTs to assume identities as statistical educators, it is necessary to introduce modiï¬cations in the curriculum of mathematics education degree programs including courses that cross boundaries between mathematical, statistical, pedagogical, and professional practices."
287,19,0.497,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"Out of the previous presentation arose the result that the development of theories in mathematics education cannot be cut off from clarifying the notion of theory and its epistemological ground related to the scientiï¬c foundation of the ï¬eld. Steiner (1983) construed this kind of self-reflection as a genuine task in any scientiï¬c discipline (see Steiner 1986) when he addressed the comprehensive task of founding and further developing mathematics education as a scientiï¬c discipline (see Steiner 1987c). At a post-conference meeting of ICME5 in Adelaide in 1984, the ï¬rst of ï¬ve conferences on the topic âTheories of Mathematics Educationâ (TME) took place (Steiner et al. 1984; Steiner 1985, 1986). This topic is a developmental program consisting of three partly overlapping components4: â¢ Development of the dynamic regulating role of mathematics education as a discipline with respect to the theory-practice interplay and interdisciplinary cooperation. â¢ Development of a comprehensive view of mathematics education comprising research, development, and practice by means of a systems approach. â¢ Meta-research and development of meta-knowledge with respect to mathematics education as a discipline (emphasis in the original; Steiner 1985, p. 16). Steiner characterized mathematics education as a complex referential system in relation to the aim of implementing and optimizing teaching and learning of mathematics in different social contexts (ibid., p. 11). He proposed taking this view as âa meta-paradigm for the ï¬eldâ (ibid., p. 11; Steiner 1987a, p. 46), addressing the necessity of âmeta-research in the ï¬eld.â According to Steiner, the ï¬eldâs inherent complexity evokes reduction of its complexity in favour of focusing on speciï¬c aspects, such as curriculum development, classroom interaction, or content analysis. According to Steiner, this complexity also creates a differential classiï¬cation of mathematics education as a âï¬eld of mathematics, as a special branch of epistemology, as an engineering science, as a sub-domain of pedagogy or general didactics, as a social science, as a borderline science, as an applied science, as a"

In the ï¬ndings by Huang and Cai (2010), the sampled teachers of the LPS data for both USA and China were willing to present cognitively demanding tasks in their lessons and implement them by soliciting studentsâ answers and organizing exploratory activities, yet the Chinese teacher was more frequently able to sustain the cognitive demand of the mathematical tasks during implementation. Mesiti and Clarke (2010) made a functional analysis of the mathematical tasks in the LPS data from China, Japan, and Sweden. They chose a novel method of selecting âdistinctiveâ tasks, which might mean either typical or unusual; however, in both cases, the tasks were chosen for suggesting instructional effectiveness. How did they make this choice? In the researchersâ interpretive reflection on the distinctive tasks, some important pedagogical values underpinning the choice were demonstrated by a few examples quoted here: The Stairs Task is well-known and used by mathematics teachers in many countries. The task was chosen for analysis because of its visual appeal and capacity to provide a focus for student attention; We chose this task (the Numbers task) in part because of its function in introducing students to the underlying structure of algebraic representations and in assisting them to develop appropriate mathematical language; The Graph Task was chosen for its strategy of âcreatingâ a real-world context for an abstract mathematical representation. The students became responsible for giving meaning to two lines on a graph and subsequently for determining the relationship in algebraic terms by identifying the value of the gradient; The Coin Task was chosen for its visual appeal, for the attempt at modeling the problem with a manipulative and for its non-routine nature; The Compare and Contrast task was chosen because of the open-ended nature of some aspects of the task (that is, to list similarities and differences) and because the sharing of studentsâ work was essential for a full discussion to take place."

The assumption was that not purely cognitive factors play a role in the learning of mathematics. In these pioneering studies, the definition of attitude is rarely made explicit, and the main goal is to prove causal correlations between attitude and other significant factors (for example, mathematical achievement). Describing the state of the art, Aiken (1970, p. 592) states, âThe major topics covered were: methods of measuring attitudes towards arithmetic and mathematics, the distribution and stability of mathematics attitudes, the effects of attitudes on achievement in mathematics, [and] the relationship of mathematics attitudes to ability and personal factors.â"

333,50,0.487,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"This report is based on a review of research papers published during the last ï¬fteen years in four leading journals in mathematics education: Journal for Mathematics Teacher Education, Educational Studies in Mathematics, Technology, Knowledge and Learning (formerly International Journal of Computers in Mathematics Learning), and ZDM Mathematics Education, as well as in proceedings of major international conferences in this area: technology groups at CERME 3â9 congresses, ICTMT 10 and 11 conferences and ICMI studies 1 and 17. A selection of forty or so papers considered as relevant to this overview were analyzed. Clearly, we do not claim to have done an exhaustive search, yet we can deem that these papers are representative of current trends in research on teacher education. Some of the studies address prospective mathematics teacher education, while others focus rather on professional development of practicing mathematics teachers, and we consider both. This paper is organized around the following four questions from the point of view of integrating technology to upper secondary mathematics instruction: (1) What knowledge and skills do the teachers need to efï¬ciently use technology? (2) How these knowledge and skills can be developed in teachers? (3) How do researchers design their studies to follow teachersâ development? and (4) What theoretical frameworks inform the research in teacher education? The concluding section brings to the fore issues highlighted in the literature review that seem worth being addressed in the TSG 43."
15,34,0.484,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","2.2.3.1 Social Issues Writing of her work with the Landless Peopleâs Movement, Gelsa Knijnik stresses the cultural nature of mathematics and the power the subject gives to those who teach and do academic mathematics while subjugating practitioners of indigenous or âstreetâ mathematics (Knijnik 1997). Benn follows a similar path when detailing her journey from a believer that mathematics is value and culture-free to a person questioning the power it holds over the adult population, particularly mature students. In her words, âI became committed to the notion that adult education has a vital role to play in a democratic society. I became convinced that the low level of numeracy in our society limit participation and critical citizenship (Benn 1998, p. 156).â In a separate paper, Benn argues that the education system perpetuates a limiting social class and working-class adults who return to study lack the social support system needed to prevail (Benn 1999). This is reminiscent of Parkerâs study on successful studentsâone of the key elements she found was the existence of a backup person willing to shoulder responsibilities so that the adult student is free to study. Cobenâs paper on Freire and mathematics education has been cited earlier in this chapter. She has also researched extensively on the Gramscian view of âcommon senseâ and its relation to mathematics education. Like Benn, Coben argues strenuously that knowledge of mathematics is socially powerful and possessing it carries prestige along with an assumption of superior intelligence in general. Common sense, on the other hand, is devalued and individuals who rely on it for mathematical decisions see themselves, and are seen by others, as socially inferior to individuals who can âdoâ academic mathematics (Coben 1999). Dias investigated the applicability of Freireâs liberation pedagogy to a basic education program in Brazil. The teachers were accustomed to using his work in a literacy program but struggled to transfer that experience to the teaching of mathematics. Teacher discussions revealed âthe existence of strong ideological beliefs about how mathematics should be taught, who can learn it, and who knows it"
317,9,0.482,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"The history of mathematics is also a story of changes, of long-term genesis of concepts with moments of continuity and sudden ruptures. How history can inform research in mathematics education is a complex matter (Schubring 2011); here we consider how research in mathematics education has used the history of mathematics in studying transitions issues. For example, Dorier (2000) studies the genesis of linear algebra and shows that this theory has emerged in particular from a need of uniï¬cation of different problems concerning functions, sequences, and so forth. Thus linear algebra is what Robert (1998) calls a formalizing, unifying, and generalizing theory: it cannot be taught as a ânaturalâ extension of previous contents or a solution to a given problem. Studying the history of mathematics draws a landscape with gaps and long paths that do not admit shortcuts. An âepistemological obstacleâ is a form of unavoidable discontinuity which has been studied by many researchers (e.g., SierpiÅska 1987), most often by identifying ï¬rst such obstacles with a historical perspective then studying the associated cognitive transitions. Cognitive transitions are also observed outside of speciï¬c mathematical contents. Concerning the learning of proof in particular, several kinds of transitions have been investigated. In the transition from phases of conjectures to phases of proof continuities and discontinuities appear, and this leads to the introduction of the concept of cognitive unity of theorems (continuity existing between the production of a conjecture and the possible construction of its proof; see Garuti et al. 1996). Other researchers have identiï¬ed structural discontinuities in the transition between argumentation and proof (Arzarello and Sabena 2011). General models of transitions taking place in mathematical thinking also exist; in particular, different theories propose models for the âtransition from process to objectâ (Tall et al. 1999). This transition is sometimes called âencapsulationâ and sometimes âreiï¬cationâ; several authors claim that it is composed of a sequence of steps. Sfard (1991) considers the transition from computational operations to abstract objects to be accomplished in three steps: interiorization, condensation, and reiï¬cation. Dubinsky (1991) in the APOS theory also considers conceptualization processes as transitions composed of three successive steps: from action to process, from process to object (encapsulation), and from object to schema. Each of the steps, or sub-processes, is seen as continuous, while the change from one step to the next can be interpreted as a discontinuity. Nevertheless, the process-object transition is not discussed by these authors in terms of continuity/discontinuity. In contrast, Tall (2002), referring to Skemp (1962) for a study of âlong-term learning schemasâ discusses the process-object transition in terms of discontinuity. The author claims that long-term cognitive development in mathematics always faces discontinuities. He gives various examples concerning negative numbers, algebra, limits, and so forth. These discontinuities, according to him, cannot be avoided in the curriculum, and they require cognitive reconstruction on the part of the student. It is thus important for teachers to be aware of these discontinuities. Should we then maintain that cognitive development is generally a discontinuous process or merely a concatenation of continuous sub-processes? This issue is discussed in Sect. 2."
88,40,0.482,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"large-scale survey research. The study captured a snapshot of eighth grade mathematics lessons of a statistically rigorous national sample of teachers, who were ordinary teachers teaching lessons that they routinely teach. The tradition of large-scale surveys of a national sample made it possible to describe average teaching based on a probabilistic statistical method. Building on the ï¬rst TIMSS study of student achievement, the TIMSS 1999 Video Study (Mathematics) compared teaching practices in the USA and places that showed higher performances than the USA in TIMSS: Australia, the Czech Republic, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. This TIMSS Video Study documented typical teaching practices in these countries. The study aimed to ï¬nd pictures of what average teaching looked like in different countries. Another aim was that studying lessons from different cultures would give researchers and teachers the opportunity to discover alternative ideas about how we might teach mathematics (Stigler and Hiebert 2004). The Learnerâs Perspective Study (Clarke et al. 2006a) was designed to examine the practices of eighth grade mathematics classrooms in Australia, Germany, Japan, and the USA in an integrated, comprehensive way. The project was originally designed to complement other international studies that reported national norms of student achievement and teaching practices. Since its inception, the LPS community has expanded to become a research community consisting of researchers in Australia, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the USA. LPS aimed to juxtapose the observable practices of the classroom and meanings attributed to those practices by the teachers and the students. The LPS research design documents sequences of at least 10 lessons, using three video cameras, supplemented by the reconstructive accounts of classroom participants obtained in post-lesson video-stimulated interviews and by test and questionnaire data, and copies of student work. In each participating country, data generation focused on three teachers identiï¬ed as competent by the local mathematics education community. The rich data set provided researchers with the opportunity to reconstruct complementary accounts of the lessons and analysis via different theoretical frameworks and focuses, giving the opportunity for comparisons of the instruction in mathematics classrooms in different countries. The design of the study did not aim for a representative national sample like the 1995 TIMSS Video Study. Instead, the project provided a way to understand what competent teachers, recognized locally in different cultural settings, might make possible."
15,20,0.481,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","Instead of these multi-faceted benefits, adult learners still feel reluctant to lifelong mathematics learning. The reasons are many. First among them is negative perception about mathematics. Many adult learners approach math with anxiety and frustration. Negative previous experiences with math instruction create legitimate barriers for many adult learners (U.S. Department of Education 2015). Mathematics in particular is often associated with negative memories, and so people try to avoid using mathematics in their everyday or vocational lives. This leads to a problematic affective situation in adult-educational mathematics courses (SchlÃ¶glmann 2006, p. 15). According to Klinger (2005, p. 7), A major challenge for practitioners in adult mathematics education is to achieve effective learning outcomes in the face of prevailing negative attitudes in their students, often present as a consequence of unsatisfactory early mathematics learning experience and flowing from the well established connection between adult innumeracy and mathematics anxiety."
227,42,0.48,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"There are traces of mathematical problems and solutions throughout the history of civilization that explain the humankind interest for identifying and exploring mathematical relations (Kline 1972). PÃ³lya (1945) reflects on his own practice as a mathematician to characterize the process of solving mathematical problems through four main phases: Understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. Likewise, PÃ³lya (1945) presents and discusses the role played by heuristic methods throughout all problem solving phases. Schoenfeld (1985) presents a problem solving research program based on PÃ³lyaâs (1945) ideas to investigate the extent to which problem solving heuristics help university students to solve mathematical problems and to develop a way of thinking that shows consistently features of mathematical practices. As a result, he explains the learnersâ success or failure in problem solving activities can be characterized in terms their mathematical resources and ways to access them, cognitive and metacognitive strategies used to represent and explore mathematical tasks, and systems of beliefs about mathematics and solving problems. In addition, Schoenfeld (1992) documented that heuristics methods as illustrated in PÃ³lyaâs (1945) book are ample and general and do not include clear information and directions about how learners could assimilate, learn, and use them in their problem solving experiences. He suggested that students need to discuss what it means, for example, to think of and examining special cases (one important heuristic) in ï¬nding a closed formula for series or sequences, analysing relationships of roots of polynomials, or focusing on regular polygons or equilateral/right triangles to ï¬nd general relations about these ï¬gures. That is, learners need to work on examples that lead them to recognize that the use of a particular heuristic often involves thinking of different type of cases depending on the domain or content involved. Lester and Kehle (2003) summarize themes and methodological shifts in problem solving research up to 1995. Themes include what makes a problem difï¬cult for students and what it means to be successful problem solvers; studying and contrasting experts and novicesâ problem solving approaches; learnersâ metacognitive, beliefs systems and the influence of affective behaviours; and the role of context; and social interactions in problem solving environments. Research methods in problem solving studies have gone from emphasizing quantitative or statistical design to the use of cases studies and ethnographic methods (Krutestkii (1976). Teaching strategies also evolved from being centred on teachers to the active studentsâ engagement and collaboration approaches (NCTM 2000). Lesh and Zawojewski (2007) propose to extend problem solving approaches beyond class setting and they introduce the construct âmodel eliciting activitiesâ to delve into the learnersâ ideas and thinking as a way to engage them in the development of problem solving experiences. To this end,"
306,63,0.48,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Many geometric activities can take place without words and without symbolism. Visual language is very rich in content so it is possible to use it at very early educational levels. The act of constructing patterns and making tessellation requires a long sequence of elementary acts: observation, ordering, copying, and repeating. Swoboda (2005) showed that drawing a pattern is not merely perceptual copying, but is a deep thinking process, which involves the body and gestures (Marchini and Vighi 2005). Of the domains of knowledge where children must enter, geometry is the one that needs the fullest cognitive activity, as it requires gestures, language, and seeing. It requires the child to construct, reason, and see; each activity is indissoluble from the others (Duval 2005). Arzarello (2004) emphasized the role of body movements and gestures in learning. Gestural expressiveness can be considered a sort of language useful to understand pupilsâ thoughts, taking into account the poor language competencies of children of those ages. Geometry as rhythms and patterns gives a chance to code and de-code rules and formulas at a very low level. The passage from perception through geometrical symbolic representation to verbal mathematical description is very long and often strange for children. Engagement in activities creates a good opportunity to create a space for discussion. Children start to transform these relations into words. By talking, these relations gain the status of existence. They emerge gradually from experience and start to be facts related to the mathematical world. a. Creation of argumentation Example 3 (Work in a small group) Children made a paper âpath,â drew âstones,â and painted them in three different colours, making patterns. The next day, the groups exchanged âpaths.â The teacher covered one stone with a sheet of paper. Children were then asked to say what colour this stone was and give the reason why their opinion was correct.1 Children could use general, abstract argumentation to see âa general in particularâ (Fig. 36) Ola (5), Wiktoria (5), and MichaÅ (4) T: Who knows which colour the covered stone is? MichaÅ: White. T: And why do you think that it is white, MichaÅ?"
306,5,0.479,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Another area of research has been the understanding of three-dimensional ï¬gures by children. It has been associated with criticism of the fact that dealing with solids takes place on higher levels of learning geometry. This goes against the natural way of discovering the world by children, which is made up of three-dimensional objects. Much of the space in this survey has been dedicated to research related to regularities in geometry. This seems reasonable, as so far patterning in geometry has been treated superï¬cially, mainly to determine whether a child can note suggested regularity. Researchers are of the opinion that the functioning of children in a world of regularity is important for not only their general mathematical development but also their geometrical. In the research on childrenâs understanding of regularity, one can distinguish a number of issuesâfrom the very fact of their perception of regularity by creating arrangements of surfaces to geometrical relations hidden in mosaics. Following Steen (1990), mathematics is actually seen as a âsearch for patternsâ: âIt is natural to try to ï¬nd the most effective ways to visualize these patterns and to learn to use visualization creatively as a tool for understandingâ (p. 3)."
333,45,0.479,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"Despite all the (possible) advantages the use of technology brings, they should be used in a reflected and considerate way. If technology is used merely as a means to an end, and students do not have to give any feedback on mathematical processes or solutions they have used, the use of technology will not make any sense at all. Nevertheless, the use of digital tools in education offers a lot of different opportunities for routines in mathematics education (cf. Greefrath et al. 2016). â¢ Use of representation options With digital mathematics tools, various representations can be produced âat your ï¬ngertipsââit is possible to easily switch between representations (cf. Kaput 2001) and, at the same time, multiple representations can be produced on the screen that are also interactively linked (Weigand and Weth 2002, p. 36 f). These technical possibilities are offset by the challenge of the learning process, which is that students have to cognitively cope with this variety of representations and visualizations in order to use them for a better understanding of mathematical content (Bartolini Bussi and Mariotti 2008). For example, functions can be represented symbolically, graphically and numerically. When using a computer algebra system, automatic transformations on the symbolic level receive a greater importance; with function plotters, the effects of changes in the functional equation can be graphically traced; and the use of a spreadsheet in particular allows the local visualization of gradual boundary processes at the numerical level. This variety of representations must be cognitively assembled into a mental model by students (see for example, Falcade et al. 2007; Ekol 2015). â¢ Reduction of schematic processes Especially through the use of computer algebra systems (CAS), a reduction of schematic processes can be achieved. By this, an overemphasis on calculation-oriented work (e.g., in âcurve sketchingâ) can be countered with CAS. Here, setting up functional equations and the interpretation of the solutions will have an increased importance, whereas the algorithmic calculations are being performed automatically. With this, the target in the classroom is, and has to be, connected to giving central mathematical ways of thinking a more important meaning."
88,68,0.479,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"3 Summary and Looking Ahead Over the last three decades, international comparative studies have completely transformed the way we see mathematics education. For example, because of the very high ranking of some Asian countries, the ï¬eld of mathematics education has become interested in mathematics education in Asian countries. We used to think that there was one basic way of teaching mathematics; international comparative studies, however, showed us many different ways of teaching mathematics in the classroom. We also learned that some student background variables (e.g., attitudes, gender) operate in different ways for students in different countries. In this Topical Survey, we have reflected on a sample of the lessons we can learn from international comparative studies. To conclude, we would like to emphasize the complementary roles of small-scale and large-scale international comparative studies. While we have used âsmallâ and âlargeâ scale throughout this paper, we have not described what we mean about the scale. The small- and large-scale international comparative studies can address different research questions. To make this point clear, we cite the report from the Institute for Education Sciences and National Science Foundation in the USA (U.S. Department of Education & National Science Foundation 2013), which presented six classes of research in their Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development: (1) Foundational Research, (2) Early Stage or Exploratory Research, (3) Design and Development Research, (4) Efï¬cacy, (5) Effectiveness, and (6) Scale-up.

In 2006 Perelman was granted the Fields Medal, which is considered to be the Nobel Prize of mathematics.3 At the special schools, the pupils were united not only because of their mathematical talents but also due to the feeling of belonging to a group of the selected and special. Moreover, the teacherâpupil relationships which even in a common Russian school have a tendency to become closer and stronger than in the West (Lonkila 1998) could be maintained even after graduation. One of the respondents remembered his own teacher at school no. 30: Everyone loved very much our math teacher, who had worked at several math schools. A circle of former graduates gathered around him, went to congratulate him on his birthday, and got to know each other. (technical director, p38) The peer pressure of the mathematically talented pupils led to a competitive study environment, where some of the pupils would voluntarily spend part of their summer holidays at a training camp studying mathematics while their counterparts in common schools were spending the summer at the beach or dacha. This kind of environment also nourished the formation of networks, which were later utilized in working life and maintained through annual meetings and/or through social networking sites and Internet forums created for keeping in touch with oneâs classmates.4 One of our respondents moved from a common school near her home to a special school which increased her daily commute to oneand-a-half hours. However, in retrospect she does not regret this move, since it not only gave her a brilliant study environment with other talented pupils, but also extended her networks geographically. If I had stayed studying at the local school (v raionnoi shkole), it would have been quite a small world (â¦).

Assuming that the ï¬rst geometrical knowledge is passive, comprehensive, global, and, therefore, static, conferring dynamism to geometric reasoning starts to be an important need. This new trend should be interpreted broadly. For a long time, the role of manipulation in early geometrical tasks was not associated with reasoning but rather referred to childrenâs working style, age, and ways of gathering information about the world. The speciï¬cs of childrenâs work indicated the use of different items for manipulation. It seemed obvious that the childrenâs work in active environments would more suitable for them, and functioning at the symbolic level would not be available. This style of work rather was implied by the Piagetian approach, which deals with the necessity of interiorisation of actions in the process of building mathematical concepts. However, it was not connected with the approach suggested by Gray and Tall (1994), which pointed to the necessity of joining processual with conceptual understanding. The pro-ceptual approach was hardly accepted by either the theory or practice of teaching geometry. Currently, designing a manipulative educational environment is focused on building a scheme for deep understanding of geometric concepts. The emphasis here is set not so much on observing objects in motion nor on the ï¬nal results of manipulation, but on the ability to predict the result of the transformation. In this survey, the research on the understanding of geometrical concepts has been grouped around two main issues: the understanding of geometric ï¬gures and the functioning of these ï¬gures in space. The problem of understanding these ï¬gures that was indicated by Van Hieleâs theory is still worth considering and research has brought much information on how it takes place in childrenâs minds. The research reveals many limitations that give children trouble with the transition to higher levels of understanding. This research direction is dominant. Studentsâ understanding of ï¬gures has been repeatedly carried out by analysing the classiï¬cation of the ï¬gures they have made and their ability to describe objects and exclude counterexamples. On the other hand, research shows that children who are functioning in a static situation based on the recognition of a geometric object are doing it much less successfully than those that have the possibility of analysing the object given to them for manipulation. At this stage of research, it is worth dealing with the level that has often been referred to as the zero level (earlier than the level that was described as the ï¬rst level in Van Hieleâs theory). Four to six-year-old children can and do successfully discover the world of geometry in many areas, but they do it in their own speciï¬c way. To use those early experiences for creating further stages of understanding, knowing, describing, and understanding them is required. Such research is performed too rarely. Additionally, this type of research requires speciï¬c methodology and being skilful in making proper observation and in analysing childrenâs behaviour."

Finally, we would like to point out the fact that mainstream mathematics education research journals publish very few articles based on the large-scale international comparative studies. The results and background theories from the large-scale international comparative studies are usually published in books and public media and specialist journals (e.g. on assessment and scaling). This is despite the fact that the data is generally publically available for analysis by mathematics educators. In contrast, mathematics education research journals publish a lot more small-scale international comparative studies. Large-scale studies are resource-intensiveâboth in terms of ï¬nancial and human resourcesâand it is important to use the results for more than the measurement of performance and rank order position to develop a scholarship around these resource intensive studies. As for individual researchers, because of less resource and time constraints, engaging in small-scale international comparative studies could be much more fruitful to future endeavor.

287,22,0.469,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"In the following decade, from 1992 up to the beginning of the 21st century, the discussion on theory concepts died down in the German community of mathematics educators while the theoretical diversity in the ï¬eld grew. Considering the two main scientiï¬c journals, we identiï¬ed scientiï¬c contributions from several theoretical communities addressing three topics related to the TME program (without any claim of completeness): 1. Methodology: methodological and thus theoretical aspects in interpretative research (Beck and Jungwirth 1999), interviews in empirical research (Beck and Maier 1993), multi-methods (Wellenreuther 1997); explaining in research (Maier 1998), methodological considerations on TIMSS (Knoche and Lind 2000); 2. Methods in empirical research: e.g., two special issues of ZDM in 2003 edited by Kaiser presented a number of methodical frameworks; and 3. Issues on meta-research about what mathematics education is, can, and should include: considerations on paradigms and the notion of theory in interpretative research (Maier and Beck 2001), comparison research (Kaiser 2000; Maier and Steinbring 1998; Brandt and Krummheuer 2000; Jungwirth 1994), and mathematics education as design science (Wittmann 1995) and as a text science (Beck and Maier 1994). This short list indicates thatâat that timeâdistinct theoretical communities seemed to share the need for methodological and meta-theoretical reflection. However, the German community of mathematics education as a whole did notâ and still does notâshare a common paradigm. In order to provide deeper insight into theory strands of German-speaking countries, two examples are presented. The ï¬rst one is the theory of learning activity that originates in activity theory developed by Joachim Lompscher. It is used today in several educational subjects: for example, Bruder has further developed and adapted this concept to the needs of mathematics education, and she and Schmitt will present this theory strand. The second theory strand is a speciï¬c view on semiotics presented by DÃ¶rfler and contrasted with Otteâs view on signs as a vehicle for doing mathematics as a human activity. The theory of learning activity provides a general educational theory that has been borrowed then applied and adapted to mathematics education, while DÃ¶rfler bases his work profoundly in the philosophies of Peirce and Wittgenstein and reconstructs mathematics as a kind of game using diagrams in a more home-grown Open Access This chapter is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits use, duplication, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, a link is provided to the Creative Commons license and any changes made are indicated."

306,17,0.467,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Perception is therefore the primary source for creating the geometrical concepts. Regardless of this, there are theories that describe the process of formation of the geometric concepts and geometric reasoning. They are the base for diagnosing the degree of formation of mathematical knowledge. References to these theories are also found in the didactical proposals. A short survey of theories on creation of geometrical concepts should start from Dina and Pierre Van Hieleâs ï¬ndings. Theory, published in 1957 in Utrecht, described in detail in the publication Structure and Insight, is one of the most well-known and frequently used bases for analysis in teaching and learning geometry. The main feature of their theory is that they have determined the levels of understanding of geometrical concepts. These levels deï¬ne the hierarchical structure of building knowledge. According to the authors, it is not possible to revolve any of the levelsâachieving higher levels is possible only after mastery of the previous level. The levels, as deï¬ned by Van Hieles, are as follows:"
68,7,0.466,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","Within this context, researchers follow a quantitative and statistical approach that was considered in that period to be a sort of warranty of the scientific nature of mathematics education. Consequently the focus of the research was mainly the development of new scaling methods (such as Thurstone or Likert Scales or questionnaires) to measure attitude and little attention was paid to theoretical aspects, in particular to the definition of attitude, and to the relationship between attitude and other affective constructs. As Leder (1985, p. 21) underlines: âin many cases, authors either implicitly or explicitly define attitude to mathematics in terms of the instrument(s) used in their research.â At the end of the 1980s, the measurement approach begins to be challenged: several studies show that the correlation between attitude and mathematics achievement is far from being clear. Moreover, the gap between development of instruments and theoretical clarification of the construct began to be considered very problematic, and many scholars explicitly criticized the state, the results, and the trend of the research on attitude: First, the construct of attitude has been vague, inconsistent, and ambiguous. Second, research has often been conducted without a theoretical model of the relationship of attitude with other variables. Third, the attitude instruments themselves are judged to be immature and inadequate. (Germann 1988, p. 689)"
134,52,0.465,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"regards to mathematics). Nevertheless in both science education and mathematics education there is a growing body of evidence-informed work about what makes for a good curriculum. Perhaps the most fundamental issue is that of content. In science education there has been a growing acknowledgement in recent times that many school curricula are overloaded. Too much time is spent covering a myriad of specific, often isolated, pieces of content with the result that the larger picture is lost. It is clearly important to have a curriculum that facilitates, or at the very least enables, students to progress in their learning as best they can. Studies on studentsâ progression in learning (whether in mathematics, in science or more generally) have often been interpreted as though learning progresses up a ladder or in stages, so that each rung of the ladder (or stage) needs to be reached before subsequent progression can occur. Unsurprisingly, fine-grained observations of studentsâ learning, such as those by Shapiro (1994), reveal that learning is rarely like this. Not only do learners sometimes regress, they also at times miss a stage (or rung on the ladder). The implication for curriculum developers is that concepts need to be ordered in a logical sequence that facilitates learning but it should not be assumed that learning proceeds inflexibly along such a route. Learning can be more like putting together the pieces of a jigsaw, where this can be done successfully in a number of ways rather than in one predetermined order. It is generally agreed in curricula round the world that mathematics and science should be core subjects. Given this, there are a number of important considerations as to which subjects should be taught in the European Schoolsâ curriculum. Parents and students will invariably bring their own understandings about curriculum planning to any discussion of a reform process. This means that if parents hold traditional views about subjects within a curriculum, for example, that there needs to be three separate sciences (i.e. physics, chemistry and biology), then it follows that, as far as they are concerned, a general science curriculum is going to appear incomprehensible or, in their view, represent a simplification and thus reduction in the quality of this important area of the curriculum. It doesnât matter whether parents are correct in their judgements about the subject make-up of the curriculum, their beliefs are significant factors in any decisions made by European school curriculum-makers, and need to be taken into account accord-"

Proponents of an early introduction to algebraic thinking, but without the use of algebraic symbolism, included the researchers who developed the curriculum project, Investigations in Number Data and Space for kindergarten up to 5th grade (TERC 1998; see Noble et al. 2001). Mathematical change, patterns and relationships, representation, and modeling were the key focus areas of this project. Moyer et al. (2004), who used the Driscoll (1999) framework to analyze this project (the Driscoll framework includes the following algebraic âhabits of mindâ: doing-undoing, building rules to represent functions, and abstracting from computation), noted that, while students are expected to come up with a general rule, âit is not the intent of the curriculum that students develop the ability to formally represent functions with algebraic symbolsâ (p. 31). In fact, studentsâ use of natural language to express arithmetical relationships, properties, and generalized pattern structures was considered by many researchers (e.g., Malara and Navarra 2003; Radford 2000) to be central to developing and expressing algebraic thinking, as well as being a mediator in the longer-term construction of alphanumeric modes of representation. Even if Early Algebra does not mean moving the traditional algebra program down to the elementary school level, there was a sense among certain researchers that alphanumeric notation can and should be gradually introduced to early algebra learners. The research program of, for example, Carraher et al. (2001; Schliemann et al. 2003) has taken these researchers into the classrooms of 8- to 11-year-olds to study the ways in which their innovative instruction leads young students to use algebraic notation to represent problem situations and to interpret the relations being represented. They have argued that students of this age can develop an enlarged sense of the equal sign, represent unknown quantities with a letter, represent relations with variables, work with unknowns, write equations, and even solve letter-symbolic linear equations (Brizuela and Schliemann 2004). Despite the evidence that some children of this age are able to use alphanumeric notation, Warren (2003) has urged caution. Her longitudinal study of young"

Others came up naturally as reflections raised in the framework of problem solving, facing the natural requirement of having appropriate problems to use results and suggestions of researches on problem solving, or as a response to a thoughtful attitude not to resign to solving and asking students to solve problems that are always created by others. Why not learn and teach mathematics posing oneâs own problems?"
15,71,0.458,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","2.5.1 Promoting Technology-Based Teaching Learning Activities for Adult Learners Talking about the use of technology as a lifelong learning tool, European Communities (2010) accept, âTechnology not only stimulates creativity and innovation, it also contributes to intercultural dialogue and plays an important role in helping us all overcome our own individual learning challenges.â Like different walks of life, technology can be of immense help for promotion of mathematical learning among adults. There are researches that support this claim. For example, Alan (2012) conducted a study to consider the use of mathematical educational software as a means of enhancing the performance rates of adult learners of mathematics in developmental courses and observed that average student in the MyMathLab/MathXL based LE course has an average grade of 2.25 (C) versus the average grade of 1.09 (D) in a traditional LE math course. These results were also substantiated by the claim of all the observed students that they were able to identify the areas that they are deficient in and spend the time on the computer âfilling in the gapsâ of their learning. In fact, technological tools offer both content specific and content neutral support in mathematics learning. In mathematics education, content-specific technologies include computer algebra systems; dynamic geometry environments; interactive applets; handheld computation, data collection, and analysis devices; and computer-based applications. These technologies support students in exploring and identifying mathematical concepts and relationships. Content-neutral technologies include communication and collaboration tools and Web-based digital media, and these technologies increase studentsâ access to information, ideas, and interactions that can support and enhance sense making, which is central to the process of taking ownership of knowledge (NCTM 2015). Therefore, more research is necessary to ensure the viability of developmental math learning with the use of technology over learning within the traditional classroom lecture format."

317,20,0.454,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"I mentioned earlier that âpieces and processesâ study of mathematical learning is rarer than for science. This example is an exception. (For a related example, see Pratt and Noss 2002.) While it is too early to generalize to all of mathematics learning the example suggests that, at the microgenetic grain-size, there is no substantial discontinuity in learning. Wagner (2006) used clinical interviews to study learning of the statistical law of large numbers. One of the theoretical tools developed by KiP shows how concepts may not be monolithic, but actually composed of many pieces each of which works only in certain contexts. Then, learning may proceed incrementally, one context at a time. In Wagnerâs study a student gradually linked in intuitive schemes (similar to the science example, above) that were approximations of normative ideas. The idea that âlarger samples are more accurateâ occurred to her speciï¬cally in the context of surveys, and demonstrably changed the range of contexts in which she could effectively apply the law of large numbers. In general, context-speciï¬c intuitive ideas seemed necessary to extend her capacity to apply the law of large numbers across new contexts, and it appeared that linking those ideas in was distributed in time, with no categorical breakthroughs (gestalt switches)."

To make this diagnosis useful for dealing with studentsâ difficulties in mathematics, we conducted a long study based on the collection and analysis of studentsâ autobiographical narratives (Di Martino and Zan 2011) in order to construct a characterization of attitude strictly linked to studentsâ experience with mathematics. An analysis of 1662 anonymous essays entitled âMaths and me: my relationship with maths up to nowâ written by students of all school levels was conducted. According to a grounded-theory approach to the data (Glaser and Strauss 1967), we used the collected data to discover a set of categories aimed at understanding how students describe their own relationship to mathematics. At the end of our analysis, we identified three main dimensions in studentsâ narratives: emotional dispositions towards mathematics, view of mathematics, and perceived competence in mathematics (only 32 essays, 2.1 % of the entire sample, did not refer to at least one of these three dimensions)."
210,65,0.451,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"Nguyen et al. (2008) examined a case study of three Vietnamese student teachers working in groups in a methods course to explore Freudenthalâs theory of realistic mathematics education (RME). The course emphasized studentsâ knowledge construction in meaningful contexts. Qualitative methods were utilized. Transcripts of class discussions and group discussions, interviews, student teachersâ lesson plans, and journal writings were the main data sources that were used to investigate the development of the student teachersâ views on mathematics and mathematics education during the course. The deliberations about teaching strategies of the three subjects working in a group to design lesson plans were also analyzed. The ï¬ndings showed that the three student teachers explored new meanings of mathematics teaching that caused them to shift from their traditional point of view to a student-centered one. Reflecting on their teaching and learning also impacted their decision to utilize the student-centered approach. It is noted that among the three subjects, there were two student teachers, who questioned the viability of the student-centered approach in the Vietnamese educational context where the social and political conditions were not favorable for teaching in this manner. Ricks (2011) discussed a theoretical framework that divides teacher reflection into two broad categories: âThe ï¬rst and most common incident reflection occurs as speciï¬c incidents or episodes unconnected to future activity. The second process reflectionâbased on the work of John Dewey and Donald SchÃ¶nâconnects reflective incidents into a cyclic progression that reï¬nes ideas through experimental actionâ (p. 251). He examined the reflective activity of a group of prospective secondary mathematics teachers as they jointly planned a public school lesson to illustrate how incidents of reflection can be reï¬ned and linked into more powerful and purposeful progressions of ideas. These studies provide evidence that it is important for PSMTs to connect what they are doing in their course work to what is happening in classrooms. The studies also helped reinforce the need for ï¬eld experiences to be embedded throughout PSMTsâ programs."

He poses that a subject to be examined by teachers and researchers âis whether, by drawing studentsâ attention to the reformulating process and given them practice in it, we can improve their problem solving performanceâ (p. 130). He also points out that problems may be a mathematical formulation as a result of exploring a situation and, in that sense, âschool exercises in constructing mathematical models of a situation presented by the teacher are intended to provide students with experiences in formulating problems.â (p. 131). Another important section of Kilpatrickâs work (1987) is Processes of Problem Formulating, in which he considers association, analogy, generalization and contradiction. He believes the use of concept maps to represent concept organization, as cognitive scientists Novak and Gowin suggest, might help to comprehend such concepts, stimulate creative thinking about them, and complement the ideas Brown and Walter (1983) give for problem posing by association. Further, in the section âUnderstanding and developing problem formulating abilitiesâ, he poses several questions, which have not been completely answered yet, like âPerhaps the central issue from the point of view of cognitive science is what happens when someone formulates the problem? (â¦) What is the relation between problem formulating, problem solving and structured knowledge base? How rich a knowledge base is needed for problem formulating? (â¦) How does experience in problem formulating add to knowledge base? (â¦) What metacognitive processes are needed for problem formulating?â It is interesting to realize that some of these questions are among the unanswered questions proposed and analyzed by Cai et al. (2015) in Chap. 1 of the book Mathematical Problem Posing (Singer et al. 2015). It is worth stressing the emphasis on the need to know the cognitive processes in problem posing, an aspect that Kilpatrick had already posed in 1987, as we just saw."

Their neuroimaging studies demonstrated that retrieval and counting strategies during the developmental phase of learning are characterized by distinct patterns of activity in a distributed network of brain regions involved in arithmetic problem solving and controlled retrieval of arithmetic facts. The ï¬ndings suggest that the reorganization and reï¬nement of neural activity patterns in multiple brain regions plays a dominant role in the transition to memory-based arithmetic problem solving. Cho et al.âs work emphasizes that developmental changes cannot be inferred from, or characterized by, a gross comparison between adults and children or by examining the effects of training on novel problems in adults. The plastic nature of the brain offers pedagogical opportunities whereby teachers can teach for the development of memory-based knowledge. Teaching children to use efï¬cient strategies to perform mental operations increases performance of both normal performing children and those who may have difï¬culties recalling number facts. When children are able to perform arithmetic operations accurately and with automaticity, they have greater opportunities to perform more complex mathematical tasks (Menon 2010), such as exploring relationships between numbers and identifying patterns underpinning number sequences. Such developmental work with arithmetic cautions against extrapolating from Lee et al.âs (2007, 2010) work with proï¬cient adults to children. These studies do, nonetheless, suggest some very interesting and important questions. How do childrenâs brains (age 9â10 years) respond when they ï¬rst learn to use the model method to represent quantitative information of canonical arithmetic expressions?

The results for the Pizza Ratio Problem above showed that Chinese students were more likely to use the conventional strategies of Argument 1 above, comparing fractions with common denominators or comparing decimals. However, only about 20 % of the U.S. students used this conventional strategy. In contrast, the vast majority of the U.S. students used somewhat non-conventional strategies. This example shows a dilemma we face. Clearly, the conventional strategy is quite efï¬cient and it can be easily applied to solve other similar problems, but this conventional strategy shows little originality. Whilst non-conventional strategies show the originality of studentsâ thinking, they are also task-speciï¬c and less easily applied to solving other problems, especially those that involve bigger numbers. The results from this particular example may suggest the effectiveness of Chinese classroom instruction in developing studentsâ efï¬cient strategies and the effectiveness of U.S. classroom instruction in developing original mathematical thinking. Ideally, we would hope that instruction can foster studentsâ learning of efï¬cient problem solving strategies and develop original mathematical thinking. If that is one of the goals for school mathematics, we have to seriously investigate the classroom instruction in both nations so that each can learn from the other. We can extend the discussion of the strategies to solve the Pizza Ratio Problem to a broader context. It is possible that educators and government ofï¬cials tend to believe that the USA does a better job of nurturing studentsâ creativity than Asian countries do. For example, Indiaâs Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, revealed that two-thirds of the nationâs universities and 90 % of its degree-granting colleges were rated as below average, and that university curricula were typically not in alignment with the needs of employers or job seekers (Bharucha 2008). On the other hand, in the USA, several recent reports call for the U.S. to learn from Asia because it is believed that Asian countries like China, India, and Singapore are much more effective in mathematics and science education, thus posing a major threat to the global competitiveness of the USA (Asian Society 2006). However, some Asian-born scholars believe that Asian countries should learn from the USA about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (e.g., Bharucha 2008; Zhao 2008) because the U.S. does a better job of nurturing creativity."

306,6,0.445,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Geometry is one of the best areas for a child to enter the world of mathematics. The geometrical world can be opened very early because geometrical knowledge correlates very well with childrenâs natural cognition. All the information gathered by perception has special importance for them. Learning for young children mainly consists of acquiring information by observing the world made up of objects. One of the features of these objects is their shape. Among shapes, there are regular ones. Perceived objects provoke further action. Children often say that a triangle is âvery nice,â which is another way of saying that it is regular (HejnÃ½ 1993). Since any regularity is attractive, it is easy to interest a child with it, and the motivation for any action is then natural. Various activities facilitate the learning of objects, creating intuition on which geometrical concepts are built. This is the main reason why geometrical concepts recognised by perception are closer to childrenâs abilities than arithmetical ones. One of the ways to further explore the world of geometry is to provide proper visual information associated with the possibility of manipulation and experimentation, with room for a childâs own creativity and ingenuity. In a patterns environment, recognizing a geometrical concept is spontaneous and is connected with solving problems in which children are able to clearly deï¬ne the purpose of their"

Numeracy has been defined as a socially based activity requiring the ability to integrate mathematics and communication skills (Withnall 1995). Other authors have characterized numeracy as a semi-autonomous area at the intersection between literacy and mathematics (Gal 2000, p. 23). In its earliest conceptualisation numeracy provision was delivered through literacy provision, which has influenced its development as a concept, consequently any discussion of the conceptualisation of numeracy would be deficient without a consideration of this relationship. An evolutionary trail of the concept of numeracy (through a literacy lens), initiated with the Crowther definition of numeracy as âthe mirror image of literacyâ, has been attempted by OâDonoghue (2002). He sets out the following waypoints in the concepts development:"

306,8,0.438,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Accumulated experience enables children to create a data set that is used by them to build up their mathematical knowledge. The use of materials for manipulation (e.g., stacking ready-made elements) has been considered to be the most effective learning environment. In addition, childrenâs drawings also have a high research value (Swoboda 2007). Patternsâ arranged with blocks, folded with puzzles, made from plasticine, lined from small pictures and ï¬gures, or drawnâare a friendly environment for children as they are close to their natural, spontaneous activity. They give the pleasure of creation without worrying about the outcome, create a chance to speak out without the fear of criticism, enable the realization of oneâs own ideas, and give motivation for manual and intellectual work. Research conducted in the United States has shown that more than 94 % of children beginning their education are able to count to 10 and identify basic shapes (Ginsburg 2004). Additionally, children between 5 and 10 can act in the âworld of regularitiesâ by discovering them. During the creation of geometrical compositions, constructing buildings with blocks, or decorating carpets, children not only better learn geometrical shapes (by comparing the lengths of the sides or recognizing the size of the angles). They may also feel the need for such arrangements that an adult can describe using the language of geometrical relationships. Symmetry, illustrated either in a broader or narrower sense, is an idea that has been used by people to describe beauty, order, and perfection. These arrangements may appear accidentally, by trying and checking, until the child considers them to be sufï¬ciently pretty. A sense of order tends to be veriï¬ed visually by children. Hence, propaedeutic of geometrical ï¬gure-to-ï¬gure relationships may reside in the sense of a certain order or harmonyâa speciï¬c arrangement of a surface or available fragment of space. The idea of engaging children in the world of rhythms and regularities is a welcome phenomenon. The preschool period is already a good time for children to become interested in building shapes and ï¬nding patterns (Clements 2001). Generally, it has been stated that creating their own patterns is a good starting point for childrenâs understanding of geometrical transformations. It is a long way to go from building a mosaic to creating geometrical concepts, but the connection between both is clear. In some handbooks for teachers, there are suggestions to do exercises with changing a ï¬gureâs position, such as drawing patterns and mosaics where translation, rotation, and mirror symmetry are used (Jones and Mooney 2003). The creative process included in childrenâs activities is regulated by perception. Theories concerning the development of geometrical reasoning stress that, at ï¬rst, understanding is passiveâconsisting of attracting attention to a particular phenomenon: the shape of a ï¬gure or line or the mutual arrangement of objects in"

210,30,0.434,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"1 Introduction Practitioners and researchers interested in prospective secondary mathematics teacher (PSMT) preparation can see technology as both an object of PSMT learning and a means for that learning. In this chapter, we present a systematic review of empirical literature to describe how PSMTs beneï¬t from technology use in teacher preparation. To arrive at the set of references, the ï¬rst author searched each of nine core mathematics education journals for articles published between 2000 and 2015 using key words: âtechnologyâ, âpre-serviceâ or âprospectiveâ, and âsecondary mathematics teachersâ. Abstracts, theoretical backgrounds and methodology sections indicated 25 articles that reported empirical results. A search of six refereed journals focused on technology, mathematics education, or teacher education1 for articles published between 2000 and 2015 using âsecondary mathematics teachersâ and either âpre-serviceâ or âprospectiveâ as key words. Upon careful reading the 35 articles, we selected 18 that focused on prospective secondary mathematics teachers and reported an empirical study.

25,35,0.434,Teaching and Learning About Whole Numbers in Primary School,"Word problems are texts that typically contain quantitative information. They typically âdescribe a situation assumed familiar to the reader and pose a quantitative question, an answer to which can be derived by mathematical operations performed on the data provided in the text, or otherwise inferredâ (Greer et al. 2002, p. 271). Most curricula contain word problems; associations of teachers of mathematics (e.g., NCTM 1989, 1999, 2000) recommend their use in teaching as a means of helping students to connect mathematics with the world outside the classroom. The literature has seen much controversy about the value of word problems, which will not be reviewed here due to space limitations. Sufï¬ce it to say that the criticism has often not been about the use of language in the classroom to present situations in which mathematical reasoning is relevant, but to the ways in which word problems have been used in the classroom. Word problems in primary school have been used often (with notable exceptions, exempliï¬ed by the work of researchers at the Freudenthal Institute) as the application of arithmetic procedures that have just been taught. When used in this way, the practice brings with it implicit assumptions that seem to restrict studentsâ reasoning and even their willingness to reason (see, for example, Chapman 2006; Chevallard 1988; Greer et al. 2002; and the excellent review by Verschaffel et al. 2010). We review in this section three different approaches to teaching quantitative reasoning, all of which use word problems as a starting point: (1) teaching quantitative reasoning before teaching arithmetic, (2) schema-based instruction, and (3) using pre-designed diagrams."
227,9,0.431,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Transferring: Successful problem solvers will be able more easily than others to transfer a well-known procedure to another, sometimes even very different context. They recognise more easily the âframeworkâ or pattern of a given task. Here, this is about own constructions of analogies and continual tracing back from the unknown to the known. Intuitive, that is, untrained good problem solvers, are, however, often unable to access these flexibility qualities consciously. This is why they are also often unable to explain how they actually solved a given problem. To be able to solve problems successfully, a certain mental agility is thus required. If this is less well pronounced in a certain area, learning how to solve problems means compensating by acquiring heurisms. In this case, insufï¬cient mental agility is partly âoffsetâ through the application of knowledge acquired by means of heurisms. Mathematical problem-solving competences are thus acquired through the promotion of manifestations of mental agility (reduction, reversibility, minding of aspects and change of aspects). This can be achieved by designing sub-actions of problem solving in connection with a (temporarily) conscious application of suitable heurisms. Empirical evidence for the success of the active principle of heurisms has been provided by Collet (2009). Against such background, learning how to solve problems can be established as a long-term teaching and learning process which basically encompasses four phases (Bruder and Collet 2011): 1. Intuitive familiarisation with heuristic methods and techniques. 2. Making aware of special heurisms by means of prominent examples (explicit strategy acquisition). 3. Short conscious practice phase to use the newly acquired heurisms with differentiated task difï¬culties. 4. Expanding the context of the strategies applied. In the ï¬rst phase, students are familiarised with heurisms intuitively by means of targeted aid impulses and questions (what helped us solve this problem?) which in the following phase are substantiated on the basis of model tasks, are given names and are thus made aware of their existence. The third phase serves the purpose of a certain familiarisation with the new heurisms and the experience of competence through individualised practising at different requirement levels, including in the form of homework over longer periods. A fourth and delayed fourth phase aims at more flexibility through the transfer to other contents and contexts and the increasingly intuitive use of the newly acquired heurisms, so that students can enrich their own problem-solving models in a gradual manner. The second and third phases build upon each other in close chronological order, whilst the ï¬rst phase should be used in class at all times. All heurisms can basically be described in an action-oriented manner by means of asking the right questions. The way of asking questions can thus also establish a certain kind of personal relation. Even if the teacher presents and suggests the line of basic questions with a prototypical wording each time, students should always be"

This is important so that the right type of data is collected. At the same time, students need to understand that not all problemsolving strategies need to involve the use of mathematics. Rather, attempting to see where the presented problem and an idealized, qualitative model depart from each other is a viable problem-solving strategy (Nersessian, 2008). 4.2.1.4.1.3 Interpret Data and Other Information Appropriately Students need to be able to analyze data in a systematic manner, but also realize that the job is not done until such analysis is interpreted in light of a theoretical framework (Giere, 1990; National Research Council, 2012). This is important because many individuals have the mistaken impression that scientific investigations always take place in a theoretical vacuum. To the contrary, theoretical frameworks always drive the design, conduction of, and interpretation of the results of research (AbiEl-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011; Ford, 2012; Giere, 1990; D. Kuhn, 2010). For example, theoretical frameworks can influence the choice of problems to investigate and the selection of variables on which to focus in an investigation (Lather, 2012; Miles & Huberman, 1984). Furthermore, knowing that differences in property A are statistically different between two objects means little without interpreting the finding in light of a theoretical framework. This is important both as something to do when investigating scientific phenomena, but also to remember that other scientists themselves do this when investigating scientific phenomena (Abi-El-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011; Giere, 1990). 4.2.1.4.1.4 Arrive at Reasonable Conclusions Much of arriving at reasonable conclusions involves interpreting findings in light of a theoretical framework (Abi-El-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011). But it also involves actively searching for conflicting findings in the literature. For K-12 students, the literature includes books, interviews with experts, and Internet resources. K-12 students need to be able to reconcile conflicting findings to arrive at reasonable conclusions. This can involve looking for what the preponderance of studies show, privileging findings from more reputable sources, considering limitations and delimitations of studies, and synthesizing different elements of findings to create a cohesive whole (Britt et al., 2014). This is a challenging activity for such students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011), who often are blinded by my-side bias (Britt et al., 2014; D. Kuhn, 1991; Stanovich & West, 2008). 4.2.1.4.1.5 Engage in Scientific Discourse Patterns Students also need to know and be able to apply and interpret patterns of STEM discourse, including explanations (Britt et al., 2014; Sandoval, 2003) and persuasive and dialectical argumentation (Bricker & Bell, 2008; Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958). Behind all scientific explanations are theories, data, and/or biases. Students need to be able to recognize such, both as they"

Empirical support is sparse also in longitudinal studies. In particular, most longitudinal studies to date have included limited ranges (e.g., middle childhood or adolescence). In addition, little research has examined the specific relation between self-beliefs and their associated behaviors across time (Davis-Kean et al. 2008). Last, comparative studies focusing on the relationship between self-efficacy and cognitive variables in mathematics education are also rare. To date, most research studies on the sources of self-efficacy have been in the field of mathematics education. In their review of the literature, Usher and Pajares (2008) refer to quantitative and qualitative ways of measuring sources of selfefficacy. The adapted version of the Sources of Mathematics Self-efficacy Scaled developed by Lent (1991, as cited in Usher and Pajares 2008) and his colleagues has been used in many studies. The findings of various studies show that mastery experience consistently emerges as the most powerful source of self-efficacy, while findings for the other three sources have been less consistent. Usher and Pajares (2009) note that these inconsistent results may be due to methodological problems such as poor reliability, aggregated scores that mask information from any one source, or multicollinearity between the sources. Usher and Pajares (2008) state that the sources of self-efficacy function best at appropriate levels of specificity and when they correspond with the self-efficacy outcome they are developed to predict. The research related to collective efficacy has been found to be significantly correlated with group performance and other collective motivation constructs such as group cohesion (Klassen and Krawchuk 2009). Despite the recognized importance of collective efficacy, almost all research is focused on teachersâ collective efficacy beliefs and very little attention has been paid to the collective efficacy of students in mathematics."

333,13,0.42,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"The distinction that Feynman makes here shows how he sees his work as intrinsically interconnected with the symbolic system that he is working with. His ideas do not occur separately from their realization in written symbols; rather, they emerge through interaction with that symbol system. It is the same as with Du PrÃ© and her cello, where there is no music without both the artist and the instrument being present. Indeed, the process of coming to be able to operate fluently and effectively with tools and symbols is common to all learners as they appropriate the practices and âhabits of mindâ of a discipline. The human mind (and indeed the human brain) re-forms itself to accommodate these new discipline-speciï¬c ways of operating. For instance, Donald (2001, p. 302) has explained that literacy skills transform the functional architecture of the brain and have a profound impact on how literate people perform their cognitive work. The complex neural components of a literate vocabulary, Donald explains, have to be built into the brain through years of schooling to rewire the functional organization of our thinking. Similar processes take place when we appropriate numbers at school. It is easy to multiply 7 by 8 without representational supports, but if we want to multiply 12,345 by 78,654 then we write the numbers down and follow the speciï¬c rules of the multiplication algorithm. It is because we have been able to internalize reading and writing and the decimal system, that we are able to perform the corresponding operations with an understanding of their meaning."

We have noted, in particular, that early algebraic thinking does not develop on its own without appropriate instructional support. And so, as we look ahead to the future, we recommend that further research be carried out in the following areas: â¢ The nature of classroom culture and the role of the teacher in fostering early algebraic reasoning. â¢ The forms of curricular activity that support early algebraic thinking. â¢ The nature of professional development that supports teachersâ capacity to foster early algebraic thinking in the classroom. â¢ Theorizing about the study of number, operations, and properties in the context of early algebra. â¢ The use of neuroimaging techniques to inform the learning and teaching of early algebra. â¢ The development and use of digital tools to facilitate the teaching and learning of early algebra. â¢ The impact of early algebraic thinking on studentsâ later study of algebra.

Despite the fact that many papers strived to address the speciï¬c features of PSMT knowledge of mathematics, still a number of them treat PSMTs as students who showed a rather deï¬cient knowledge of mathematics. Knowledge of mathematics teaching was less central in the research papers reviewed. This refers mostly to teaching of different mathematics topics, and it was often related to mathematics knowledge. The TEDS-M large-scale study (BlÃ¶meke et al. 2014) focused on the interrelationships between CK, PCK and general pedagogical knowledge in three participating countries, while the study conducted by Aguirre et al.

88,69,0.415,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"Foundational research, to the examination of the effectiveness of interventions across a wide range of demographic, economic, and implementation factors in Scale-Up research, scale is a critical factor in establishing the believability of our conceptual models and the potential efï¬cacy of our designed innovations in mathematics education. Small-scale studies tend to be used towards the beginning of a research program to explore new phenomena. Large-scale studies, in contrast, tend to be employed after such methods or instruments have been piloted and their use justiï¬ed, and the phenomena to which they apply have been adequately deï¬ned. Anderson and Postlethwaite (2007) deï¬ne the purpose of large-scale studies as describing a system as a whole and the role of parts within it. But the complexity of the system, and the type of understanding to be gained from the study, greatly impact how large the scale must be. There are a number of advantages of large-scale international comparative studies, such as their utility for understanding situations and trends, the technical capacity they provide for testing hypotheses involving a number of variables, and the sophisticated analytic methods often employed in such studies (Cai et al. 2015; Middleton et al. 2015). The international comparative studies, such as TIMSS and PISA report a wide range of achievement variables, school variables, system variables, and student variables, and there are literally thousands of individual results for each survey. As a multitude of commentaries also attest, the implications of any of these results for educational policy must be derived with careful attention to local situations and to the details of the measurement instruments. There are also resource and time limitations for conducting large-scale international comparative studies. Because of less resource and time constraints, small-scale international comparative studies, on the other hand, can offset some of the pitfalls of large-scale international comparative studies by providing valuable analysis that is relevant to the situation of the particular participants. Small-scale studies allow for in-depth analysis of issues being studied. Thus, while small-scale and large-scale international comparative studies are conducted separately, their ï¬ndings and analysis could complement to each other for us to understanding and improving studentsâ learning. An alternative complementary role of the small-scale and large-scale studies is to conduct in-depth analyses for some issues based on the large-scale data. For example, go back to PISAâs three processes of Formulate, Employ, and Interpret. When we compare students from Australia, China, Singapore, and the USA on the three processes, we found a different pattern. For Australia and USA students have relatively better performance on interpreting than on the other two processes, while Shanghai and Singapore students did a better job on formulating than on the other two processes. With in-depth analysis from large-scale data, we can ï¬nd such subtle, but important differences, but we need a range of other studies to understand why this might be the case (Table 5). In addition to small-scale and large-scale studies, LPS gives an example of another possible kind of international collaboration that serves a complementary role to the other international studies and provides opportunities for studying the artifacts of classroom instruction by reconstruction of the classroom data from"
317,35,0.414,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"When we look at investigations that approach the transition between primary to secondary compulsory education (for instance, Attard 2010) as well as pilot initiatives carried out in various countries or regions (see for instance Bryan and Treanor 2007 for the Scottish case), we ï¬nd a common agreement about the influence, not always negative, of the following changes. At the school level, we pass from a main generalist teacher to various specialist teachers per class, with less fluent interaction between pupils and teachers, tighter time schedules, less relevant out-of-school activities, and a smaller intervention of parents in school events. At the level of pedagogy, hands-on materials and concrete activities are left behind, learning activities become more usually based in written activities and more transmission oriented, and less place is left for collective work and multidisciplinary activities. When considering the level of the discipline, and with respect to the S-U transition, there are not many investigations focusing on the more speciï¬c levels, those related to a mathematical domain or theme. The main exception is research on early algebra (Carraher and Schliemann 2014). As a matter of fact, algebra has long been the âtransition topicâ par excellence, marking the frontier between elementary and secondary education. We can thus interpret research on early algebra as the ï¬rst attempt to blur the frontier by introducing a properly secondary content at primary school. How this might affect (and be affected by) other mathematical domains, for instance measure and quantities, statistics, or geometry, is an open question. Geometry is the other domain that is approached in the P-S transition (see, for instance, Sdrolias and Triandaï¬llidis 2008). Research on this area shows the impact of curriculum discontinuities on studentsâ and teachersâ practices. In fact, many of the proposals to smooth the transition or to increase the engagement in mathematics of students entering secondary schools are mainly based on strengthening the relationships between primary and secondary teachers, sharing teaching activities carried out in both institutions, and, particularly, promoting more open activities during the ï¬rst years of secondary school. Apart from early algebra, we do not ï¬nd proposals to modify the curriculum (discipline level)"

336,12,0.413,"Early Algebra : Research into Its Nature, Its Learning, Its Teaching","Although pattern ï¬nding in single-variable situations was becoming fairly common in elementary mathematics curricula, Blanton and Kaput (2004, p. 142) argued that elementary school programs that aim at promoting algebraic reasoning should extend further to include functional thinking (which they deï¬ned as ârepresentational thinking that focuses on the relationship between two or more varying quantitiesâ). From the studies they carried out in prekindergarten up to 5th grade, they found that students as young as those in kindergarten could engage in co-variational thinking and 1st graders could describe how quantities corresponded."
25,23,0.411,Teaching and Learning About Whole Numbers in Primary School,"(3) Appropriateness of cognitive elements that sustain the solution process: Researchers who adopt this approach do not share the idea of choice between different solution paths (see, e.g., Threlfall 2002, 2009; Rathgeb-Schnierer 2010; Rathgeb-Schnierer and Green 2013, 2015). Rather than the choice of the most suitable solution or the quickest way of obtaining a solution, appropriateness is conceived as a match between the combination of strategic means and the recognition of number patterns and relations of a given problem during the computation process. The recognition of number patterns and relations and their use in solving a computation depends on a studentâs knowledge of numbers and operations. In this sense, flexibility in mental calculation can be considered as an âinteraction between noticing and knowledgeâ (Threlfall 2002, p. 29). All three approaches to mental flexibility can be linked to the model proposed for the process of calculation presented in Fig. 1. The ï¬rst two approaches focus predominantly on a single domain of the calculation process: either the domain methods of calculation or the domain tools for solution. Within the third approach, researchers also take the cognitive elements into account and therefore focus on two different domains to identify the degree of flexibility in studentsâ mental arithmetic: solution methods and the cognitive elements that sustain the solution processes. Consequently, evidence of flexibility in mental calculation can exist only if the tools for solution are linked in a dynamic way to problem characteristics, number patterns, and relationships. Different methods have been used in the study of flexibility in mental calculation, some of which, such as the choice/no-choice method, borrowed from other domains of research where decision making is involved. We single out the choice/no-choice method for description here, as it may lead to other uses of the method in different contexts in mathematics education. The paradigm is simple: in the choice condition, the participants are allowed to solve the task in whichever way they desire. In the no-choice condition, participants are shown a demonstration of the method they should use in the task. Using this methodology, Verschaffel and his colleagues have been able to demonstrate that some of the assumptions made about what is the best strategy for some tasks might be questionable. When students are taught different ways of approaching subtraction, for example, they are encouraged to use subtraction by complementary addition in tasks where the difference between the minuend and the subtrahend is small; it is assumed that in tasks where the difference between the minuend and the subtrahend is large, direct subtraction is more efï¬cient. However, using the choice/no-choice method, they observed that children (Verschaffel et al. 2016) as well as adults (Torbeyns et al. 2009c, 2011) are faster and more accurate when they use complementary addition as the route to solving subtraction problems, irrespective of whether the difference between the minuend and the subtrahend is large or small. Based on different deï¬nitions of flexibility and on different methods, researchers have examined different elements of flexibility in mental addition and subtraction and reported a variety of results:"

Indeed, they connect with and express very general features of the human experience of the world. This is why, if we were to read in the newspaper tomorrow morning that the Natural Numbers had been destroyed in a ï¬re, we would smile. We know this is not possible, even though there are many instances of representations of the Natural Numbers in perishable material media. Part of the reason for the more enduring nature of symbolic entities like the Natural Numbers is the very fact that they do not refer directly to speciï¬c objects in the physical or cultural world. That is, the representational and symbolic challenges with which we opened this discussion are also sources of mathematical power. To understand the nature and power of symbolic entities, we can look ï¬rst at how they emerged in human history and then at how they operate in modern discourse."

The ï¬ndings showed that the teachers documented in LPS showed little evidence of a consistent lesson pattern, but instead appeared to vary the structure of their lessons purposefully across a topic sequence. The analysis then focused on âlesson events,â a viable unit for comparison, characterized by a combination of form (visual features and social participants) and function, such as intention, action, inferred meaning, and outcome (Clarke et al. 2006a, b). For example, Kikan-Shido (also known as between-desk instruction or seatwork) had a recognizable structural form evident across all classrooms. It was during the enactment of Kikan-Shido that each teacherâs relative prioritization of monitoring or guiding student activity was most evident. Taking the documented Shanghai lessons as an example, the teacher in the lessons circulated and commented on the studentsâ work. In some cases, he might be correcting errors, and in some cases he might be encouraging students to think further than their original solution (Lopez-Real et al. 2004). For the German lessons, the teacherâs use of questioning to stimulate student mathematical thought during Kikan-Shido was very evident in the data (Clarke et al. 2006a). The analysis of Japanese lessons (Hino 2006) showed that following the seatwork activity, the teacher used the studentsâ work for a variety of purposes, including: eliciting their mistakes, eliciting their puzzlement, eliciting opposing solutions, pointing out different solutions and giving explanations, pointing out difï¬culties and giving explanations, taking up studentsâ questions and making their way of thinking visible to the group. The ï¬ndings from this LPS study suggested additional reasons to those identiï¬ed in the TIMSS Video Study about why the enactment of Japanese lessons differed from the other countries. The studentsâ seatwork in Japanese lessons served the function of student exchange of information and opinions, and thinking about the problem together (Mok 2015)."

However, my perception was a bit wrong, as I learned more about the psychological background than anything else. Fortunately, psychology does interest me, mostly as to how people think and their perception of products and their surroundings. In my opinion, however, the learning line is a bit too much. After one course of 5 ECTS, I had learned enough about psychology, with the two other courses of Human in Technology merely acting as repetitions of the ï¬rst course. My interest faded because of these repetitions and my motivation began to decrease. The project, on the other hand, was a lot of fun. We used the information we learned in a practical sense. My conclusion therefore is that one course with lectures and one project is sufï¬cient; in this way, you keep students motivated. In this project, I learned about the different persuasive techniques, the usability and how all these features are important for achieving an application with a goal of changing the way people think. The USE learning line could stand to become more useful for students, however the concept is clear and USEable!"

Warren (2002) also noted the difï¬culties that 8- and 9-year-olds experience in handling problems with unknowns. Van Ameron (2002) similarly reported from her study of Dutch students that nudging 11-year-olds to use symbolic formulas is not productive, not even if it is done in a tentative and well-considered way. While technology was not a major component of much of the early-days research in Early Algebra, there were a few exceptions. For example, the research of Ainley (1999) and Ainley et al. (1998) showed that spreadsheets, with their algebra-like notation and graphing facility, can be quite productive with 8- to 11-year-olds as a tool for emergent algebraic reasoning. Sutherlandâs (1993) research in the ANA Logo project with 11- and 12-year-olds reported studentsâ successful use of variables to express simple mathematical relationships within the context of teacher-developed and teacher-supported tasks in the Logo programming environment."
306,18,0.407,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","During the ï¬rst levelâthe visual levelâconcepts develop on the basis of experiences and conscious observations from reality: students ï¬rst learn to recognize shapes then analyse the properties of the shapes. The visual level is the main step in spatial knowledge. On the visual level, students recognize a ï¬gure as a whole and are able to represent it as a mind vision. Note that Van Hiele (1986) states that âthe levels are situated not in the subject matter, but in the thinking of manâ and Arcavi (2003) suggests that visualization can be considered as a method of âseeing the unseen.â Moreover, Viholainen (2006) states that âvisual thinking is probably the most usual type of informal thinking in mathematics.â At the visual level, therefore, the student: â¢ identiï¬es, compares, and sorts shapes on the basis of their appearance as a whole; â¢ solves problems using general properties and techniques (e.g., overlaying, measuring); â¢ uses informal language; â¢ does not analyse in terms of attributes. Later students see relationships between shapes and make simple deductions. Only after these levels have been attained can they create deductive proofs. Van Hiele did not deem that any of the levels was free from the thinking. In particular, it cannot be assumed that the visual level eliminates action (manipulation) by objects.

223,106,0.407,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"To the budding geographer the time-bound message could not be misunderstood: Capture the power of social relations in a net of scientific laws and then, like your friends in physics, chemistry, and medicine, you too will have acquired the means not merely for understanding the world but for changing it as well. If the natural scientists know how to construct rockets that take them to the moon, if they know how to generate energy by enriching uranium, if they know how to save lives by transplanting hearts, then your duty as a social scientist is to discover similar techniques for eradicating poverty! Before you accept that challenge, though, be sure to ask yourself first why no one now reads Plato and Aristotle for what they had to say about physics or medicine, then why so many continue to return to the plays of Sophocles and Shakespeare for their insights into the human condition of hopes and fears, love and hate. How does the circumstance that we have accumulated knowledge in some areas and not in others relate to Aristotleâs remark that we should look for precision in each class of things just as far as the nature of the subject admits and that it would be equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician as to demand scientific proofs from a rhetorician? No small order given to a young man inexperienced in the actions that occur in life and therefore prone to pursue each object as passion directs. And yet, how could I possibly have ignored the challenge? GO ON, GO ON. The list of required readings included the classics of location theory, cognitive science, decision theory, systems analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, spatial statistics, and a sprinkle of historical geography, all of it somehow yoked together in Walter Isardâs conception of Regional Science and its extension into Peace Science, the latter firmly anchored in the Quaker-thin interface of scientific knowledge and political action, John Deweyâs pragmatism and the collections of the Barnes Foundation never far away. A formative experience it was, the handsome fellowship that in 1963â1964 took me to North Armorica and the intellectual hubs of the Wharton School, Berkeley, and Northwestern. Great. Yet, in hindsight, the seeds might well have been planted 10 years earlier by the odd gymnasium teacher who did whatever he could to introduce his rowdy pupils to the concentric rings of von ThÃ¼nenâs isolated state and the cost curves of Alfred Weberâs isodapanes. Perhaps I was the only one to pay attention, but the truth is that I can still feel in my body the boyâs excitement when he literally saw why there were so many gauchos on the Pampas and so many steel mills along the Ruhr. The rhetorical power of geometric construction on the high wire, von ThÃ¼nenâs agricultural landscape depicted as an archerâs target with the bullâs eye as the central city on a homogeneous plain (more correctly the Junkerâs own estate), Weberâs factory finding its place of least cost, the Archimedean point that is located at the center of a Euclidean triangle whose corners are the concepts of transportation, labor, and agglomeration. Deep roots it has, the subsequent definition of geography as a geometry with names, essentially an exercise in the drawing and baptizing of points, lines, and planes.

Each of the studies addressed technology in combination with one or both of content and pedagogy. Only one of the 13 articles addresses pedagogy. Zembat (2008) examined the nature of mathematical reasoning and algebraic thinking in a paper-and-pencil environment compared to that in a technology-supported environment (Sketchpad and Graphing calculators). He used Sternbergâs (1999) model to describe three types of reasoning: Analytical reasoning refers to the ability to think about formulas and applications of those to abstract mathematical problems that usually have single correct answers. â¦ Practical reasoning refers to the ability to solve everyday problems or reason about applications. .. Creative reasoning refers to the invention of methods in thinking about problems. (p. 146)

Some examples are shown in Fig. 33. b. Axial symmetry There were also situations where a child created a symmetrical, limited construction. Its creation proceeded floor by floor. The whole work then had only one symmetrical axis (Fig. 34). Table 2 presents a quantitative analysis of the presence of isometries in the Italian pupilsâ protocols. Table 2 reveals that the rate of application of the more complex isometries grows with the pupilsâ age, even if the children in the sample did not receive any formal geometry teaching. We can interpret this data by observing that the enhancement of manipulation ability obtained by school teaching is probably also of beneï¬t for improving geometrical and spatial intuitions. Marchini et al. (2008) treats these and other interesting geometrical features discovered in protocols in depth. It is possible to observe a low number of symmetries, even if the drawings on the tiles could suggest their use. This supports the ideas that the âmetaphor of equilibriumâ (NÃ¹Ã±ez et al. 1999) does not influence the pupilsâ performance and that symmetry is not an embodied cognition but mathematical knowledge that must be constructed by learning (Swoboda 2007; Bulf 2010; Bulf et al. 2013; Bulf et al. 2014a; Bulf et al. 2014b)."
227,59,0.398,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Kilpatrick (1987) marked a historical milestone in research related to problem posing and points out that âproblem formulating should be viewed not only as a goal of instruction but also as a means of instructionâ (Kilpatrick 1987, p. 123); and he also emphasizes that, as part of studentsâ education, all of them should be given opportunities to live the experience of discovering and posing their own problems. Drawing attention to the few systematic studies on problem posing performed until then, Kilpatrick contributes deï¬ning some aspects that required studying and investigating as steps prior to a theoretical building, though he warns, âattempts to teach problem-formulating skills, of course, need not await a theoryâ (p. 124). Kilpatrick refers to the âSource of problemsâ and points out how virtually all problems students solve have been posed by another person; however, in real life âmany problems, if not most, must be created or discovered by the solver, who gives the problem an initial formulationâ (p. 124). He also points out that problems are reformulated as they are being solved, and he relates this to investigation, reminding us what Davis (1985) states that, âwhat typically happens in a prolonged investigation is that problem formulation and problem solution go hand in hand, each eliciting the other as the investigation progressesâ (p. 23).

336,10,0.396,"Early Algebra : Research into Its Nature, Its Learning, Its Teaching","category in the 1992 Handbook of research on mathematics teaching and learning (Grouws 1992). It was an emerging body of work that was coming to be referred to around the world as Early Algebra. In contrast to the traditional teaching of algebra that usually begins when students are about 12 years of age, the growing body of work on early algebra tended to focus on the 6- to 12-year-old. However, the interest in algebraic thinking is not restricted to the young learner; the term algebraic thinking has become central to current algebra research involving the older learner as well (see, e.g., Radford 2010; Zazkis and Liljedahl 2002)âalgebraic thinking having been deï¬ned by, for example, Blanton and Kaput (2004) as âa habit of mind that permeates all of mathematics and that involves studentsâ capacity to build, justify, and express conjectures about mathematical structure and relationshipsâ (p. 142). In addition to the younger age range in this body of work known as Early Algebra was a subtle shift in emphasis from a traditional content-centered characterization of algebra to that of the mathematical reasoning processes and representations that would seem appropriate for young children, as well as to the nature of the early algebra activities that might promote the development of these processes and representations. In particular, the main focal themes during the years leading up to the early 2000s included: (i) generalizing related to patterning activity, (ii) generalizing related to properties of operations and numerical structure, (iii) representing relationships among quantities, and (iv) introducing alphanumeric notation."
210,75,0.395,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"they were typically assigned to cooperating teachers in groups. The focus of the student teaching experience is also quite different, with primary attention given to preparing, teaching, and reflecting on selected lessons. The cooperating teacher and group of student teachers assigned to him/her provided intensive feedback on each lesson plan to be taught by a student teacher prior to it being taught, observed their teaching of the lesson, and participated in a reflection meeting after the lesson. Throughout this process, focus was placed on the structure of the lesson and its impact on student thinking, rather than the presentation of the lesson. Peterson (2005) concluded that this emphasis on lesson preparation might be useful for U.S. teacher educators to consider. Arbaugh et al. (2007) explored viewpoints surrounding ï¬eld experiences in a post-baccalaureate certiï¬cation program for secondary mathematics and science teachers. Such programs can be completed in a short period of time following completion of an undergraduate degree, which raises questions about how to incorporate effective ï¬eld experiences. The program the authors designed and studied was grounded in Shulmanâs work on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and how to create a âtransformative pathwayâ (Arbaugh et al. 2007, p. 193), which led them to create a year-long internship experience. They collected data during a day-long meeting of students, cooperating teachers, and university personnel in which participants evaluated different ways of organizing the ï¬eld experienceâsuch as participating every day but perhaps for less than a full day versus participating full days but perhaps not every day, and one single year-long placement versus multiple shorter placements. They also conducted exit interviews at the end of the year. Arbaugh et al. (2007) found that while all three groups liked the intensity of the year-long model, they had very different ideas about how the experience should be organized, based on their personal needs and experiences. The interns preferred the every-day model in which they participated half-days, which was similar to what they were experiencing. They felt this provided more depth in seeing how content developed as well as more flexibility in scheduling. In contrast, the coopering teachers had more reservations about the students only teaching half-days, noting that is does not reflect the full teacher role and creates more disruptions. The university personnel saw merits in the half-day format, since its flexibility might help with recruitment, but felt that two semester-long placements might be more effective given difï¬culties in identifying year-long placements. The authors used these ï¬ndings to adapt their model for the next cohort so that it would better meet the needs of the different stakeholders in alignment with their emphasis on PCK and creating transformative pathways."

Thus the choice of a representation is always a consequential choice that constitutes the view and access we have to mathematical object. Symbolic entities shared some features with early concrete physical tools, while they also differed from early tools in other respects. Vygotskyâs (1978) famous analysis of this relation was that while tools enabled humans to operate on and exert control over the world, symbolic entities also enabled humans to exert control over themselves and regulate their own internal thinking processes-being a central part of these processes. In coming to operate with tools and symbolic entities, human beings gained enormous new powers. Donald (2001) describes this process as the advent of âtheoretical cultureâ and it is the centerpiece of the Baldwinian interpretation of cultural evolution (Baldwin 1896). With tools, humans encoded processes of labor and craft in physical objects, which afforded (Gibson 2014) the actions that constituted those processes. In this way, tools began to structure human society, so that emerging habits of mind, ways of life, and classes of society were reflected and transmitted in the characteristics sets of tools that supported them. Thus, these extensions to human nature also supported intergenerational development, capturing successful innovations in a transmission medium more flexible and more easily shareable than the biological substrate of DNA. With the symbolic system of written language, communications could be detached from particular interpersonal contacts, enabling new forms of literature, history, science, and philosophy. And with the symbolic system of mathematical discourse, the study of abstract form and structure could take shape and transcend the lives of individual thinkers."

68,45,0.391,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","and (c) intervention research aimed at overcoming studentsâ or teachersâ negative attitudes towards mathematics. Longitudinal studies appear to be crucial to evaluate the effects of âremedial intervention on attitudeâ over time. In Sect. 2.2 Pantziara discusses in detail research findings concerning self-efficacy beliefs. Researchers in the field of student mathematics self-efficacy beliefs suggest several topics that need future investigation. Particularly, there is a need for a clearer understanding of how efficacy beliefs develop so that appropriate interventions can be developed to improve student self-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs. Moreover, the directionality of the relationship between collective efficacy and group performance remains largely unexplored. Cross-cultural research is needed, as it may reveal how mathematics self-efficacy operates in diverse contexts and how students in contrasting settings function. We need more research on self-regulation and how to improve learnersâ self-regulatory skills. Moreover, we need research on studentsâ beliefs in their capabilities to exercise control over their learning environment in order to optimize their efforts. Last, there is a need for more longitudinal studies and studies with experimental designs (Davis-Kean et al. 2008; Klassen and Krawchuk 2009; Klassen and Usher 2010; Skaalvik and Skaalvik 2011). In Sect. 2.3 Zhang and Morselli sketched a holistic and historical review of research on teacher beliefs in mathematics education, showing that the research focus has moved from the definition and characterization of beliefs to two crucial issues: the relationship between beliefs and practice and belief change. Around these two issues many other factors including internal and external contexts are also discussed widely. The first issue may be rephrased, seeing teachers as sensible systems that act in a coherent way. This suggests the need for further research aimed at a deeper comprehension of the context within which the teaching and learning takes place and of all the factors that affect teaching. The context can include curriculum reform, social-cultural influence, and also many internal interrelated dimensions (Hannula 2012). More generally, further exploration is needed to uncover possible factors that affect practice. On the one hand, research should go on investigating the roots of observed practice, as advocated by Cross (2015). On the other hand, research could address the teaching of different mathematical topics and investigate which beliefs affect such practice. Moreover, the investigation of factors affecting practice may also serve as a basis for efficient teacher development programs. Teacher education programs should move from changing beliefs per se to making teachers aware of beliefs and other factors affecting practice. New generations grow up within e-learning environments and diverse and interactive learning material and their learning environment may be very different from the school their teachers studied in. Teacher beliefs about the integration of ICT and mathematics teaching and how teachers face the changing classroom environment are also issues that need further investigation. In Sect. 2.4, Heyd-Metzuyanim, Lutovac, and Kaasila discuss the issue of mathematical identity. In general, they note that the theoretical frameworks drawn on in the research on student and teacher identities are quite similar. Both draw heavily on socio-cultural theories that view learning as becoming a participant in a"
17,21,0.391,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"education. Naturally, it needs to be recognised that âsocial justiceâ is an open concept, the meaning of which can be explored in many different directions. Addressing equity also represents concerns of critical mathematics education, and the discussion of social justice and equity bring us to address processes of inclusion and exclusion. Social exclusion can take the most brutal forms being based on violent discourses expressing racism, sexism, and hostility towards âforeignersâ or âimmigrantsâ. Such discourses might label groups of people as being âdisposableâ, âa burdenâ, or ânon-productiveâ, given the economic order of today. It is a concern of critical mathematics education to address any form of social exclusion (see, for instance, Martin 2009). However, social inclusion might also represent a questionable process: it could mean an inclusion into the capitalist mode of production and consumption. So, critical mathematics education needs to address inclusion-exclusion as contested processes. However, many forms of inclusion-exclusion have until now not been discussed profoundly in mathematics education: the conditions of blind students, deaf students, students with different disabilitiesâin other words: students with particular rights. However, such issues are now being addressed in the research environment created by the Lulu Healy and Miriam Goody Penteado in Brazil. Such initiatives bring new dimensions to critical mathematics education. Mathemacy is closely related to literacy, as formulated by Freire, being a competence in reading and writing the world. Thus, DâAmbrosio (1998) has presented a âNew Trivium for the Era of Technologyâ in terms of literacy, matheracy and technoracy. (DâAmbrosio talks about matheracy, while I prefer to use mathemacy.) Chronaki (2010) provides a multifaceted interpretation of mathemacy, and in this way it is emphasised that this concept needs to be re-worked, re-interpreted, and re-developed in a never-ending process. Different other notions have, however, been used as well for these complex competences, including mathematical literacy and mathematical agency. Jablonka (2003) provides a clarifying presentation of mathematical literacy, showing how this very notion plays a part in different discourses, including some that hardly represent critical mathematics education. The notion of mathematical agency helps to emphasise the importance of developing a capacity not only with respect to understanding and reflection but also with respect to acting. Dialogue. Not least due to the inspiration from Freire, the notion of dialogue has played an important role in the formulation of critical mathematics education. Dialogic teaching and learning has been presented as one way of developing broader critical competences related to mathematics (see AlrÃ¸ and Skovsmose 2002). Dialogic teaching and learning concerns forms of interaction in the classroom. It can be seen as an attempt to break at least some features of the logic of schooling and as a way of establishing conditions for developing mathemacy (or mathematical literacy, or mathematical agency). Problem-based learning and project work can also be seen as way of framing a dialogic teaching and learning. Pedagogical imagination. Critique in terms of imagination has been formulated in terms of sociological imagination. Through such imagination one reveals that something being the case could be different. I ï¬nd that a pedagogical imagination"
306,31,0.39,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Various activities related to the manipulation of shapes affect their better recognition, and the need to determine the properties common for a âfamilyâ affects a better familiarity with shapes. This situation forces the use of language, which supports the transition to the descriptive level. In this way studies show that for children from the age of 5â7 years old in an active environment, evolution of the visualization is accessible for the students, although it does not seem to be used spontaneously (Coutat and Vendeira 2016). Situations that involve naming of particular shapes and the influence of names to deal with ï¬gures have appeared in many publications. There have been observations that show that the fact that the word triangle can refer to many objects of everyday life can be an obstacle to the construction of the concept of triangle (Vighi 2003a). Coutat and Vendeira (2016) have noted that children tend to give shapesâ both geometric and non-geometricânames that are associated with objects from the real world. Naming objects in this way makes it easier to deal with shapes as such. Another problem that has often been undertaken relating to the understanding of geometric ï¬gures at a slightly higher level has been the study of the understanding of the relationship between triangles and quadrangles (i.e., classiï¬cation of quadrangles). This problem can be placed at the transition between the descriptive and relational level. Research has focused on this problem due to the belief that students at this educational stage need not only know geometric properties but also need to understand relationships between properties and shapes. The aim of such studies has been to determine the ability to describe the ï¬gures and to observe attempts to create deï¬nitions. Studies have repeatedly been carried out that use models and ï¬gures that students have to group according to properties they choose themselves. Quadrilaterals and the relationships among them have often been a part of elementary school mathematics curricula. Research has suggested that students initially focus on visual characteristics of ï¬gures instead of their properties (Mack 2007). One of the reasons for having students operate with prototypical ï¬gures is their static understanding in the typical position: considering quadrilaterals to be static ï¬gures with certain properties (e.g., a trapezium is a ï¬gure with one pair of parallel sides, one of which is parallel to the bottom edge of the paper). This has been considered to be the main reason for students not being able to conceptualize the interrelationships among different quadrilaterals (Walcott et al. 2009). Some of this research has analysed these skills while examining the impact of teaching style. A constructivist approach to teaching has developed the concept of inquiry-learning through self-exploration. Researchers have been trying to determine to what extent questioning may influence an increase in competence in describing ï¬gures (Lee 2016). The conclusion that has come from these studies suggests that when students are faced with the need to answer teachersâ âwhyâ questions they are forced into deeper analysis of the properties of ï¬gures. However, this generalization may be wrong. It is necessary to take into account the different needs of students, including different ethnographically embedded learning styles and possible different interpretations of questions. This has been a particularly signiï¬cant problem in certain Asian countries (Hsu and Lin 2009)."

25,21,0.389,Teaching and Learning About Whole Numbers in Primary School,"In this process, number meaning is often lost, and errors such as those described by Brown and VanLehn (1982) are not necessarily recognized by the person doing the calculation. The effect of different oral systems of signs on childrenâs interpretation of number and on their arithmetic skills has also been recognized in research in mathematics education (e.g., Bender and Beller 2011; Chung and Bryant 2001; Fuson and Kwon 1992; Miller et al. 1995, 2000; Miller and Stigler 1987; Miura et al. 1999; Song and Ginsburg 1988). An aspect that has not been explored systematically in the research described in this and in the subsequent section is the form of presentation of the calculation tasks; this might turn out to be more important than it appears and could be a new aspect for investigation in the future."
336,29,0.388,"Early Algebra : Research into Its Nature, Its Learning, Its Teaching","A large number of past studies of studentsâ functional thinking have focused on the upper primary and middle school grade students (e.g., Ellis 2007). However, some researchers investigating studentsâ understanding of functional relationships suggest that even younger children, with age-appropriate pedagogical support, are able to engage in co-variational thinking and can represent how two varying quantities correspond in multiple ways, including with letters as variables. Moss and London McNab (2011) have reported that second graders could ï¬gure out a general function rule by focusing on the relation between the position number and the number of blocks in geometric growing pattern activities. The students were also able to develop a robust understanding of two-part function rules (i.e., y = ax + b) by noticing the constant in visual arrays and representing it in their natural language. Blanton et al. (2015a) have emphasized that even some of the ï¬rst graders in their study were able to generalize various functional relationships between co-varying quantities and that their initial levels of understanding could become further sophisticated with the support of well-designed instruction. Within that same study, Blanton and her colleagues developed a learning trajectory to describe ï¬rst-grade childrenâs (6-year-olds) thinking about generalizing functional relationships. The trajectory, which can serve as a framework for related work on the development of young childrenâs functional thinking, involves different levels of sophistication in generalizing functional relationships by specifying whether children can (a) notice mathematical features in a task, (b) understand the relationships between quantities through recursive thinking or functional thinking, (c) observe the regularity within particular instances or otherwise across all instances, (d) describe a functional relationship in a generalized form, (e) elaborate on two quantities being compared and the functional relationship between them, and (f) deal with function as an object while understanding the boundaries of the generality. Understanding the characteristics of such levels is signiï¬cant because it sheds light on how sophisticatedly young children condense the functional relationships. From their longitudinal studies of 3rd to 5th graders, Carraher and Schliemann (2015) have found that students as young as 8â9 years of age can use relations to derive other relations. For example, with the statement, âTom is 4 inches taller than Mary and Mary is 6 inches shorter than Leslie,â students were able to derive Tomâs height from Maryâs and Leslieâs heights, to derive Maryâs height from Tomâs and Leslieâs heights, and to derive Leslieâs height from Tomâs and Maryâs heights. They learned to express this ternary relation on a number line with a âvariable origin Nââwhat the researchers termed the âN-number line,â and in which positions were denoted as N-2, N-1, N, N+1, N+2, and so on. While some of the past research involving younger studentsâ algebraic thinking has focused on the challenges of introducing functional ideas, such as for example, shifting studentsâ focus from a recursive to an explicit functional perspective (Warren and Cooper 2008), the more recent work suggests that students in the lower primary grades, even in kindergarten, may be far more able to begin to think algebraically than was previously imagined. But this does not occur spontaneously."
17,41,0.388,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"and the papers presented are based on completed research projects. The GT practice is to analyse and to debate each paper. Another signiï¬cant aspect revealed in the GT 11 of SIPEM is the power of the scientiï¬c debates within this group, with different styles of research conducted, as well as the diverse concepts and themes studied. The papers are mainly phenomenological, drawing on authors such as Edmund Husserl, Wittgenstein, Deleuze and Foucault. The discussions within the group are not characterised by dogmatic attitudes sustaining positions presented as correct, but are rather more open, based on questioning and attempts to understand the presentations, looking for convergence of ideas, the enhancement the ï¬eld, or enlightenment of the subjects discussed. An analysis of work produced and published in Brazil in this strand of the philosophy of mathematics education reveals that the movement of discourse construction of the text is through questions that the authors pose to themselves when they become aware about the positivity of their statements. We do not refer here to the questions or interrogations of research, assumed as the motto impeller that triggers the research, but those that are implemented in the dialogue of authors with themselves and with the text that they are architecting. This manner of proceeding is an important tool of philosophical thinking to avoid naturalizing assumptions. Instead, the statements are accompanied by arguments that expand possible understandings and expose the debates that occur in the dialogues mentioned. Description is also revealed as an aspect characterizing philosophical work of philosophy of mathematics education. Descriptions are reports which in the analysed texts provide the ideas of references to works that show themselves relevant to the content of the focused documents analysed, or reports of experiences of signiï¬cant individuals focussing on the phenomena or complex situations experienced in speciï¬c instances and occurrences. They offer differing nuances when the work is developed using phenomenological methods, reporting the experiences of individuals engaged with the phenomenon under study; or ways of mapping, describing complex situations that are experienced in the movement of located existence; or even documents analysed hermeneutically to provide the descriptions mentioned above so that the reader becomes aware of varying interpretations; or also of important ideas in the literature in the treatment of the issue, showing what is said, so that the researcher is able develop accounts and articulations. The essay turns out to be close to the above mentioned investigative procedure, since the writing is articulated in terms of sustained ideas in the explanation of interpretative readings of relevant authors, from the standpoint of education, philosophy and the subject itself, articulating what was understood in new ideas. In this respect the essay shows itself variously nuanced, since the poetical appears and exhibits itself alongside the speech presented in the text. In the work on philosophy of mathematics education in Brazil there has been diversity of references used by the authors in presenting their papers, but the articles reveal a common method, which involves continually problematizing and interrogating the text that is being written; describing the living experience and the way in which ideas are articulated; and gathering ideas of signiï¬cant authors around a"
88,64,0.387,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"We need to move beyond the estimates of national mathematics achievement scores to investigate the factors that influence mathematical performance. The emerging results from our analyses conï¬rm the effects of home and school socio-economic factors on mathematics achievement. As expected, students who speak the language of the test at home are more likely to achieve higher scores than those who do not. Similarly, the analysis conï¬rms that student achievement is higher for age appropriate students. We explored the effects of two contemporary, South African issues on achievement, namely gender and school violence. We found new complexities in the schooling experience of South African boys and girls. On average, across South Africa, gender differences in mathematics test results were small or non-existent. We also probed students about their attitudes to mathematics and found that both boys and girls valued mathematics. A particularly worrisome ï¬nding is the level of indifference among boys about their education. Boys were found to have lower aspirations about their academic careers, showed less interest in mathematics and engaged less often with an adult regarding their school work. The link between negative attitudes and weak performance was stronger for boys than for girls. Boys were also at a higher risk of being victims of bullying than girls. The second issue we explored was the extent of violence in South African schools and the effects on mathematics achievements. Although concerns about school safety are increasing internationally, violence in schools is considered more serious in South Africa than elsewhere. We found that school related violence may be linked to conditions in communities. The extent of school safety largely depends"
298,11,0.387,The Globalization of Science Curricula,"for labor force, the mobility of people, and the influence of intergovernmental agencies, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or the European Union, are promoting increasing similarities among countriesâ education systems and curricula. Supranational organizations, such as the World Bank, may also exert their influence on educational systems, particularly in developing countries. But is education around the world really becoming increasingly similar? Does evidence exist to support the notion that the curricula developed by ministries of education and educational practice in schools are increasingly conforming to a set of âinternational standardsâ and, if so, is it possible to identify these benchmarks? Where research studies on the globalization of curricula do exist, they have tended to focus on mathematics curricula as opposed to science curricula (Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2009; Zanini and Benton 2015). Science education is an important subject to investigate from a global curriculum perspective because science has always been an international discipline, with important discoveries and advances being made all over the world, but with the need for a central body of understanding for these to be interpreted and presented as a school curriculum. Therefore, internationalized thinking has long been an influence on the development of science curricula, arguably more so than in subjects such as literature or history, which are more likely influenced by national cultural and historical perspectives. Many of the topics taught as science in schools are directly influenced by global factors, such as human health and disease, environmental impacts including climate change, and the future of food and energy supplies. It can also be argued that scientiï¬c development is the predominant driver of economic growth and quality of life. Consequently, understanding how science is intended to be taught provides insight into how future citizens are taught about the nature and role of scientiï¬c advances. The IEAâs Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has collected extensive data on intended mathematics and science curricula of participating countries since the 1990s (Mullis et al. 2016). While the intended curriculum is not necessarily what was implemented or achieved, it nonetheless has a strong influence on the implemented and achieved curricula of an education system. Twenty years of collected data provides a valuable opportunity to directly explore the effects of globalization on countriesâ science curricula over time. Given the global nature of science and science curricula, this study aimed to address three central research questions: Have there been changes in intended science curricula over the last 20 years? To answer this question, we conducted a coding exercise in which changes in the intended science curriculum of countries participating in TIMSS were tracked using responses to the TIMSS curriculum questionnaire. This not only enabled the identiï¬cation of changes in the curriculum but also enabled the nature of changes to"

Taking pattern or ï¬eld orientations into account allows for foreseeing what kinds of tasks the students might solve successfully. Initiating a learning activity does not only focus on the current task situation but requires also taking past learning experience and future goals into account. Tools, e.g., diagrams, do not belong to the kernel of the theory. Its kernel encompasses the concept of activity and how a learning activity can be shaped, initiated by tasks, and created by the learner with the help of the teacher. The teacherâs role is crucial. Referring to the example above, one intended application is concerned with the problem of which further tasks the teacher can choose in order to assist the students in building the concept of Â¾ to be represented by various shapes. The strength of this approach is its prescriptive nature for initiating learning activities, while diagrams may serve one kind of resource among others. While both approaches share the sensitivity towards acting, the core concepts (e.g., diagram) of the one theory lie more in the periphery of the other (e.g., as a resources for a learning activity). If we take a networking of theories view and coordinate the analyses by using the two theoretical views, the empirical situation presented may be investigated according to two complementary questions: (1) what and how can acting with diagrams express mathematical ideas and (2) how can a task with certain goals be designed to initiate basic actions, such as identifying and realizing in a speciï¬c stage of the course of instruction, that are built on prior knowledge and preparing future goals to achieve cultural knowledge. Thus, both approaches complement each other and may enrich each other to inform practice (see TME program): coming from the learning activity we may zoom into (see Jungwirth 2009 cited by Prediger et al. 2009, p. 1532) diagram use, and coming from diagram use we may zoom out (ibid., p. 1532) to embed the diagram use into the whole course of the learning activity.

298,23,0.384,The Globalization of Science Curricula,"the concept of the knowledge economy as one of the most signiï¬cant factors contributing to the globalization of education and curricula. As countries around the world become more engaged in the globalized economy, there develops an important need for nations to prepare their young people for active participation within these globalized markets (Sellar and Lingard 2014). Also, as countries seek to build and develop knowledge-based economies, this has a direct effect on education and school curricula as politicians seek to equip learners with the skills and competencies that are needed to succeed in the global economy. Weber (2011) identiï¬ed this phenomenon in the Gulf states, where the focus on the knowledge economy is influencing school curricula as politicians seek to diversify these states from their current hydrocarbon-based economies. The knowledge economy is linked to the increased focus in many countries on the role of education in promoting economic growth. As a consequence, there has been greater emphasis in many countries on schools developing and equipping students with workplace skills and competencies and preparing them for life beyond education. This in turn has the potential to lead to convergence in science curricula as countries adapt curricula to focus on aspects of science that have more potential to facilitate future economic growth. Globalization and the economic aspects of globalization are of particular relevance to science education and science curricula, as many of the most globalized sectors of the economy have a technological or scientiï¬c basis that requires speciï¬c scientiï¬c knowledge and skills. Computer and mobile technologies, pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, petrochemicals and emerging clean energy technologies are for example some of the most globalized sectors of the world economy. Therefore, countries seeking to develop economic engagement in these areas may consider changes to science curricula as a medium- to long-term strategy for successful involvement in these sectors."
78,322,0.382,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In his Die AufklÃ¤rung in the Age of Philosophical Engineering Stiegler (2013) accepts the challenge introduced by Tim Berners-Lee, who argued that âwe are not analysing a world, we are building it. We are not experimental philosophers; we are philosophical engineersâ (Halpin 2008). Berners-Lee was not merely describing the activities of the architects of the World Wide Web he invented. He was calling them to account for the impact of their engineering on the constitution of mind and society. He was inviting them to build a new res publica. Stiegler is more careful. He suggests that digital technology is a pharmakon: âit can lead either to the destruction of the mind, or to its rebirth (ib.).â Referring to Wolf (2008) he notes that the transition from the reading mind to the digitally extended mind entails substantive changes to the composition and behaviour of our brains. Though these changes may be cause for celebration, they also threaten the constitution of the self. In the course of his text Stiegler reiterates the crucial question of what we need to preserve as a valuable heritage of the era of the âreading brainâ (Wolf 2008). I want to connect this with the need to reconstruct the social contract, recognizing its modern roots and its contingency on the ICT infrastructure of the printing press. A new social contract would have to align with the novel technological landscape, co-opting current ICTs to incorporate checks & balances. In that sense we will need a hybrid social contract that testifies to the agency-characteristics of smart environments.3 Though we might wish to declare âGame over for modernityâ, this may require us to give up on the social contract that protects against immoderate government. Let us remind ourselves that the end of modernity would not necessarily be the end of totalitarian governance. The hidden complexity of computational layers in fact affords refined and invisible manipulations that may be closer to the totalitarian nightmares of Kafkaâs Trial (Solove 2004) and Forster Machine (Forster 2009) then to the dictatorial schemes of Big Brother watching you. Stiegler (2013) notes that the spread of traceability seems to be used primarily to increase the heteronomy of individuals through behaviour-profiling rather than their autonomy."
25,39,0.382,Teaching and Learning About Whole Numbers in Primary School,"the information: When Mrs. Elastic took 12 steps, how many would Dazz take? When Mrs. Elastic took 15 steps, how many would Dazz take? The numbers were chosen so that scalar reasoning was easily used; 12 is twice 6, and 15 is 12 plus half of 6. The children found the ratio diagram easy to use and were quick in applying it to other problems. A problem presented later on was: Paul replaced 5 energy saving bulbs in the bathroom and saved Â£20 that year. He then decided to replace all the bulbs in the kitchen as well. There are 8 bulbs in the kitchen. How much money will he save? This problem is not easily solved by doubling; it requires extending the scalar reasoning to the search for the unitary value. Figure 4b presents one studentâs solution. A major advantage of the ratio table was that students did learn to organize their thinking, separating out the numbers that referred to each of the quantities. Whereas at the start they might have carried out computations without thinking about the quantities that the numbers represented, by using the diagram this was not a problem later on. In two studies in which we used Streeflandâs ratio table, one in which the researchers taught small groups of children and another in which teachers used the program with their classes, we obtained positive results. Statistical analyses showed that the group that worked on quantitative reasoning made more progress in problem solving than the group that did not (Nunes et al. 2015a); however, this outcome cannot be attributed only to the use of the ratio table because the program involved other components. In a recent study, Nunes et al. (2016) demonstrated the impact of teaching quantitative reasoning on childrenâs mathematical achievement. In a large-scale randomized controlled trial, second graders who participated in a mathematical reasoning program that included no teaching of arithmetic performed signiï¬cantly better than the children in the control group, both in problem solving and arithmetic. As the children did not have any extra time on mathematics teaching during this period, it seems safe to conclude that the improvements were an outcome of the teaching of quantitative reasoning. Thus there is some evidence that children can beneï¬t from teaching that focuses on quantitative reasoning and uses representational tools that help them mathematize situations."

It is worth noting that he promoted 11 Ph.D. students, as well as 148 MScâs and engineers. He liked and valued his teaching activities. He treated students with a true respect and in a friendly manner. For almost 20 years, he shared his knowledge with students of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Technology at the Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz (formerly the Academy of Bydgoszcz), with the major of âIT Engineeringâ that he coestablished. For over 15 years, he gave academic classes on various IT subjects at PJAIT, where he was one of the key people forming the teaching program on AI tools and applications. Professor KosiÅski also gave advanced lectures as part of graduate and postgraduate courses on the analysis of waves, constitutive modeling of nonelastic media, and thermodynamics of continua with superï¬cial singularities, as well as on selected issues of mathematics, artiï¬cial intelligence, and information technology, in such units as: the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the University of Warsaw, the Stefan Banachâs Center, the University of Iowa, and the University of Rome âLa Sapienza.â In the 1990s, he delivered a truly inspiring graduate course on neural networks at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw, where he was able to put together various aspects of his background and experience to provide students with both advanced mathematical foundations and practical motivation for mastering the AI-based methodologies."
294,1,0.379,Programming For Computations - Python : a Gentle introduction To Numerical Simulations With Python (Volume 15.0),"Target audience and background knowledge This book was written for students, teachers, engineers and scientists that know nothing about programming and numerical methods from before, but who seek a minimum of the fundamental skills required to get started with programming as a tool for solving scientific and engineering problems. Some knowledge of one- and multi-variable calculus is assumed. The basic programming concepts are presented in only 50 pages (Chapters 1 and 2), before practical applications of these concepts are demonstrated in important mathematical subjects addressed in the remaining parts of the book (Chapters 3-6). Each chapter is followed by a set of exercises that cover a wide range of application areas, e.g. biology, geology, statistics, physics and mathematics. The exercises were particularly designed to bring across important points from the text. The reader will realize that the modest content of the first 50 pages can in fact bring you quite far in powerful problem solving! Learning the very basics of programming should not take long, but as with any other craft, mastering the skill requires continued and extensive practice. Some beginning practice is gained through Chapters 3-6, but the authors strongly emphasize that this is only a start. Students should continue to practice programming in subsequent courses, while those who exercise self-study, should keep up the learning process through continued application of the craft. The book is a good starting point when teaching computer programming as an integrated part of standard university courses in mathematics and physical sciences. In our experience, such an integration is doable and indeed rewarding. Numerical methods An overall goal with this book is to motivate computer programming as a very powerful tool for doing mathematics. All examples are related to mathematics and its use in engineering and science. However, to solve mathematical problems through computer programming, we need numerical methods. Explaining basic numerical methods is therefore an integral part of the book. Our choice of topics is governed by what is most needed in science and engineering, as well as in the teaching of applied physical science courses. Mathematical models are then central, with differential equations constituting the most frequent type of models. Consequently, the numerical focus in this book is on differential equations. As a soft pedagogical starter for the programming of mathematics, we have chosen the topic of numerical integration. There is also a chapter on root finding, which is important for the numerical solution on nonlinear differential equations. We remark that the book is deliberately brief on numerical methods. This is because our focus is on implementing numerical algorithms, but to develop reliable, working programs, the programmer must be confident about the basic ideas of the numerical approximations involved. The computer language: Python We have chosen to use the programming language Python, because this language gives very compact and readable code that closely resembles the mathematical recipe for solving the problem at hand. Python also has a gentle learning curve. There is a MATLAB/Octave companion of this book in case that language is preferred. Comparing these two versions of the book provides an excellent demonstration of how similar these languages are. Other computer languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, have a strong position in science and engineering. During the last two decades, however, there has been a significant"

As individuals, they have âfelt their way aroundâ the Cartesian space, searching for points that meet the equidistant criterion. On ï¬nding one, they recognize an isosceles triangle and experience a particular sensation of symmetry. However, based on their own point-based explorations, they can see each of the points in the shared space as a solution to a local problem. This supports a deep and flexible way of thinking about the locus of points and the perpendicular bisector, which has value beyond that which would be gained from the individual experience of a dynamic geometry environment alone."

The nature of that tension is anything but new. We have known it in the philosophy of science in the form of the context of discovery versus context of justiï¬cation divide. A justiï¬cation is preferably seen as something independent from the discovery process. In other words, if I need to justify something, I need not wonder about how it is has been found. In the case of mathematics, if such an independence holds, then I only need to look at the ï¬nished proof, the ï¬nal version and wonder whether or not I can justify that this text that claims to be a proof, indeed is a proof. The processes that led to the proof are of no"

These aims link connections between position and velocity across various representations. In this activity, the representations available to the student are limited to focus attention on speciï¬c relationships between position and velocity. Students work in small groups of four where the parameter âcâ corresponds to their group number, given as the starting position of a rocket traveling in space and the acceleration for the rockets is invariant across groups, i.e. â2aâ. Small group work on a TI-graphing calculator is sent to the teacher via a classroom network and all representations are available for the teacher to display. Before displaying student work, students are asked to make conjectures about the family of functions created in both a position versus time context and a velocity versus time context given they have utilized representations from each. In this way, students are asked to abstract from the speciï¬c work of the small group to something more general that would describe all groups in the class. They have ownership over an individual contribution, but this individual contribution is now a piece of the whole in which, together, the class aims to make sense of in terms of the mathematical goals of the activity. This structure of the environment in a connected classroom plays a central participatory role and supports co-action (Moreno-Armella and Hegedus 2009) between the students and the representational affordances of the software."

342,7,0.371,Semiotics in Mathematics Education,"can only be hinted at here, caused substantial endeavour within cultural science into investigating the use of images from many different perspectives (see, e.g., Mitchell 1987; Arnheim 1969; Hessler and Mersch 2009). The introduction to âLogik des Bildlichenâ (Hessler and Mersch 2009), which we can translate as âThe Logic of the Pictorialâ, focusses on the meaning of visual thinking. In this book, they formulate several relevant questions on visualisation which could/should be answered by a science of images. Among these questions we read: epistemology and images, the order of demonstrating or how to make thinking visible. Letâs take a further look at a few examples of relevant literature from cultural science concentrating on the âvisual.â In their book The culture of diagram (Bender and Marrinan 2010) the authors investigate the interplay between words, pictures, and formulas with the result that diagrams appear to be valuable tools to understand this interplay. They show in detail the role of diagrams as means to construct knowledge and interpret data and equations. The anthology The visual culture reader (Mirzoeff 2002) presents in its theory chapter âPlug-in theory,â the work of several researchers well known for their texts on semiotics, including Jaques Lacan and Roland Barthes, with their respective texts âWhat is a picture?â (p. 126) and âRhetoric of the imageâ (p. 135). Another relevant anthology, Visual communication and culture, images in action (Finn 2012) devotes the fourth chapter to questions which concentrate on maps, charts and diagrams. And again theoretical approaches from semiotics are used to interpret empirical data: In âPowellâs point: Denial and deception at the UN,â Finn makes extensive use of semiotic theories. Even in the theory of organizations, semiotics is used as means for structuring: In his book on Visual culture in organizations Styhre (2010) presents semiotics as one of his main theoretical formulations."
192,60,0.371,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"researchers may become the victims of science as well: tormented, craving subjects (Mayer, Cantor, etc.: $), who suffer from experiences of crisis, comparable to how Oedipus fell victim to a political crisis in mythic times, but at the same time adding something to the oedipal scenario (Lacan 1966, p. 870), because for Lacan the subject of science introduces a new type of subjectivity (S2), as we have seen. The âsubjective dramaâ of scientific progress can be represented by the formula S2 â $ which points to the subversion of the impassive, rational agent (S2) and the resurgence of the divided, tormented subject ($). Whereas the ancient worldview concurred with the concept of the Platonic sphere, and the modern worldview developed on the basis of the Cartesian coordinate system, the question inevitably emerges what mathematical concept represents the basic topology (the basic spatiality and subjectivity) of the current era, which began in 1900? For Lacan, the basic topological structure which exemplifies contemporary scientific subjectivity is the Moebius ring. Psychoanalysis is not depth psychology, he argues, and the unconscious is not a hidden animalistic or archetypal depth of an allegedly rational conscious subject. Rather, the unconscious is the reverse side of consciousness. In the case of a Moebius ring, although there is only one surface, there is always a reverse side, a blind spot, a missing part. But once we get there, the opposite side is lost to us again, for there is always a reverse (1962â 1963/2004, p. 161). We will never reach a position of absolute knowledge, and the gap between knowledge and truth cannot be sutured. The subject of science is constituted by this split, this rupture between (partial) knowledge and (unattainable) truth (1961â1962, p. 48, p. 87, p. 189, p. 199) and this creative failure or impotence (dÃ©faillance, âÏ) fuels rather than discourages the will to know (1968â1969/2006, p. 275)."
70,58,0.37,Optics in Our Time,"Descartes Until Kepler, the main motivation of studying the nature of light came from a desire to understand vision. RenÃ© Descartes (1590â1650) appears to be the first person to concern himself with the intrinsic nature of light and the laws of optics. Descartes was a French philosopher and mathematician who had a great impact on western philosophy. He is heralded as the Father of Modern Philosophy. His mathematical contributions included a connection between geometry and algebra that allowed for the solving of geometrical problems using algebraic equations. Descartes promoted the accounting of physical phenomena by way of mechanical explanations. Descartes main contribution to optics is his book Dioptrics that was published in 1637. It deals with many topics relating to the nature of light and the laws of optics. He compares light to a stick that allows a blind person to discern his environment through touch. Descartes used a tennis ball analogy to derive the laws of reï¬ection and refraction of light. The credit of the discovery of the law of refraction is given to Willebrord Snellius (1580â1626) who derived it using trigonometric methods in"
247,41,0.37,Humanities World Report 2015,"Employment of graduates is an important issue in discussions about education in the humanities and liberal arts. The claim is that humanities disciplines prepare students for the world of work, whatever that may turn out to be. For instance, they teach students how to scan large bodies of text and information to detect patterns; how to use language to persuade; how to evaluate and construct arguments. There are, of course, difficulties in measuring the economic impact of the humanities and these are discussed in Chapter 5. A few of our interviewees took up the economic argument: E6: I would try to persuade the audience that people with degrees from the humanities have acquired (unique?) transferable skills that may be very useful in a much wider context than in professions where such degrees are directly relevant. In the humanities we study and interpret human behaviour as manifested by singular events â historical battles, works of art, all kinds of texts, etc. â and try to integrate them into larger patterns in order to understand them as well as possible. This is very different from what one does in the sciences, where the aim is to establish generalisations that, without exception, hold over a range of phenomena. Such singular events are what our lives are made up of, and the ability to interpret and understand them is therefore important at almost every workplace, of course in combination with more specialised knowledge. As5: If you fund humanities studies, you develop analytical skills and a definite philosophy in life which help you in any profession eventually. ME1: The more we invest in understanding human beings through SSH research, the more productive they will become. A conspicuous appeal to the economic value of the humanities has been made by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, which has embraced the argument wholeheartedly.15 Strong arguments in favour of the economic value of the humanities to the creative and cultural sectors have also been made by Scandinavian and EU reports.16 However, the economic argument has provoked a backlash among other humanities scholars. A number of prominent figures in the UK have founded the Council for the Defence of British Universities (CDBU) partly to promote an understanding of the broader value of universities (not just in the humanities).17 A recent national report on humanities and social"

The author, a doctoral student in the natural sciences, but one who crosses into several different areas, cogently sets out the reasons why being (or being seen to be) âinterdisciplinaryâ can mean facing âan uncertain futureâ (Byrne 2014). The problem, the student points out, is the mismatch between institutional eulogies for the interdisciplinary, and the antediluvian structures of advancement and prestige both within and outside those same departments â journals, funding councils, adjudications of teaching expertise â that split resolutely along disciplinary lines. âTrying to gain expertise and familiarity with the literature in multiple subject areas can be a discouraging and near-impossible task,â she points out: âThereâs a risk of ending up being an expert in nothingâ (Byrne 2014).

287,36,0.369,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"presentation by Lompscher (1975, p. 46) on the model interrelations between analytical and synthetic operations in mental activities was taken up by Bruder and BrÃ¼ckner (1989). According to this approach, identifying and realising mathematical contents can be described as elementary actions on the basis of deï¬ned mental operations. Empirical studies provide preliminary indications of evidence that these two elementary actions can be distinguished and also of basic actions of a more complex construction, such as describing and justifying each time in relation to given mathematical concepts, connections, or processes (see Nitsch 2015). Such a hierarchical approach to describing learning actions results in a heuristic construction for learning and test tasks (see the general approach to the task theory in Bruder 2003) which has already proven its worth in theoretical competence modelling. These action hierarchies are currently being used in a project aimed at describing the requirements for the central school-leaving examinations in Austria in a four-stage competence structure model for action dimensions in operating, modelling, and arguing (see Siller et al. 2015). Such a theoretical background was also used for the construction of items within the scope of the project HEUREKO on the empirical clariï¬cation of competence structures in a speciï¬c mathematical context, notably the changes of representation of functional relationships (see Nitsch et al. 2015). Boehm (2013) used basic positions of the activity theory to establish curricular objectives for mathematical modelling at Secondary Level I. The theoretical framework for the analysis of modelling activities that he elaborated allows for a differentiated model description of the action elements in mathematical modelling. This also includes the successful involvement and clariï¬cation of problem-solving activities in modelling. Mathematical problem-solving competence can be interpreted, from an activity theory angle, as variously pronounced mental agility where mental agility represents a marked process quality of thinking [see the construct of process qualities in Lompscher (1976)]. According to Lompscher (1972, p. 36), content and the progress of learning actions are decisive for the result. Bruderâs (2000) operating principle in acquiring problem-solving competence was that through the acquisition of knowledge about heuristic strategies and principles, insufï¬cient mental agility can partly be compensated. This approach was transferred to a teaching concept about learning how to solve problems in four stages building on each other, and the corresponding effects at student level have been empirically proven (Bruder and Collet 2009; Collet and Bruder 2008). Nitsch (2015) investigated typical difï¬culties of learning in changes of representation of functional relationships and interpreted these as incomplete orientation bases. Existing error patterns could be described as inadequate patterns. In this way, and in connection with the concept of basic ideas (Vom Hofe 1995), a tentative explanation is provided about mechanisms to activate certain mathematical (error-) ideas. In terms of orientation bases, there was a discussion in the 1970s both in the GDR and in a Western response by critical psychology about whether another type going beyond the ï¬eld orientation should be added to the previously mentioned"
68,31,0.368,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","2.4.3 Teacher Identity After the 2000âs, several lines of research on mathematics-related teacher identity emerged, including the samples of: (a) pre-service elementary teachers (Hodgen and Askew 2007; Jones et al. 2000; Lutovac and Kaasila 2011; Ma and SingerGabella 2011; Walshaw 2004), (b) pre-service mathematics teachers (de Freitas 2008; Goos 2005; Goos and Bennison 2008), (c) in-service elementary teachers (Spillane 2000; Drake et al. 2001), (d) in-service mathematics teachers (Graven 2005; Hodges and Cady 2012; van Zoest and Bohl 2005), and (e) teacher educators (e.g., Grootenboer 2013). There is also a relatively new line of research addressing the identities of mathematics coaches (Chval et al. 2010). The definitions of teacher identity in these studies usually go hand in hand with the theoretical approaches of the concept. One of the most widely used is sociocultural, building on Lave and Wengerâs (1991) and Wengerâs (1998) work, seeing identity as a way of belonging to different communities of practice and an activity of participating in them (e.g., Goos 2005). Other perspectives include post-structural (Brown and McNamara 2011; de Freitas 2008; Walshaw 2004) and psychoanalytic (e.g., Black et al. 2009a), as well as perspectives deriving from multiple areas of research. This situation has resulted in a variety of definitions and often the absence of them altogether. In terms of methodology, most studies are conducted as small-scale qualitative studies, and there seems to be an expansion in the use of narrative and discursive methods. Generally, teacher identity is seen as a dynamic construct, i.e., changing over time and with a general consensus on its contextuality. Thus, studies have tended towards subject-matter identities such as that of a mathematics teacher, but also towards multiple identities bound to diverse teacher roles and the multiple communities they participate in. Studies have also pointed to the fact that the nature of teacher identity may be different in different countries (Leung 2001; Lutovac and Kaasila 2014). Most studies in one way or another demonstrate the interaction between teacher identities and teachersâ practices, making it apparent that changing one will affect the other. Moreover, the external demands posed on teachers (e.g., school reforms) inevitably affect teachersâ identities: teachers often see changes as threatening to their identity, thus their identity becomes an obstacle for change (see also Gellert et al. 2013)."
227,32,0.367,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"The work of Mason et al. in their book Thinking Mathematically (1982) also recognizes the fact that for each individual there exists problems that will not yield to their intentional and mechanical attack.

The main processes are what they refer to as specializing and generalizing."

Second, as we will see, there are direct conceptual parallels between his ideas and many of the more mathematically rigorous modern ideas. Third, Hayekâs work in theoretical psychology is underappreciated, especially given both its breadth and depth. We will see that Hayekâs work provides a conceptual framework that suggests overlap between a number of modern theoretical ideas and AAA (Fig. 8d). With regards to AAA, the main point here is the connection between computation at the single cell level (e.g., as discussed, coincidence-detection, association) and more network-level implications. This link is what Hayek explores. Hayekâs foundational idea is quite straightforward. He posited three orders: (1) the external world (which he called the physical order), (2) the brain (which he called the sensory order), and (3) the mind (which he called the phenomenal order), and he focused his efforts on understanding the relationship between the three. In Hayekâs formulation, the state of the brain has an isomorphic correspondence with that of the mind. The structure of the psychological realm, for Hayek, was relational (e.g., psychological objects are defined relative to other psychological objects), and as such, that structure of relationships that make up the psyche had to be recapitulated in the structure of the neural network and its activity. This strict correspondence contrasts with the correspondence between the outside world and the structure of the brain (and thus the mind), which is imperfect, as shown by the existence of sensory illusions. The problem for Hayek was then to describe how the relational network that is the psyche can be encoded in the structure and activity of a neural network, given the computational properties of single neurons that make up that network. Although this might seem trivial to todayâs standards, it cannot be overstated how important this development was, especially given prevailing ideas at the time. In the end, we will see that Hayekâs solution comes in a form that is in many ways remarkably similar (though missing the details of biophysics and anatomy that remained uncovered until the 1990s) to the ideas of AAA, Integrated Information theory, and Predictive Coding and discuss their connections. For Hayek the main questions were: 1. How can a relational network be encoded in the structure and activity of a neural network?10 2. How are the relations between objects in the outside world learned and encoded (imperfectly) in the neural network of the brain11?"

There are therefore still opportunities for higher education practitioners and policy makers at different levels to make their voices heard. This section of the books arising from the Bologna Researchers Conference provides a valuable contribution to this debate through three reasoned and well-researched contributions as well as, it is hoped, through this essay brining the section together. Rather than seeking to draw an overriding conclusion from three contributions that all stand on their own and that approach the âfuture of Bolognaâ from different angles, I would like to offer a ï¬nal thought from yet another angle. With the possible exception of âemployabilityâ, there is hardly a word that occurs as frequently in current education debate as âqualityâ. However, quality is more often than not presented as an established entity, something that is âout thereâ and all we have to do is strive for it and preferably achieve it. However, it makes little sense to assess whether we do something well unless we know what we are trying to do in the ï¬rst place. The quality debate may be rich in describing ways of reaching and not least measuring quality, but it is surprisingly divorced from considerations of what purposes education should serve (Bergan 2005; Council of Europe 2007, 2012). Consideration of the link between higher education reform and the broader purposes of higher education has also been subdued in the development of the EHEA. This is not to say it has been absent. The EHEA builds on a set of values that comprise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and student participation, and several communiquÃ©s refer to the multiple purpose of higher education. Nevertheless, a relaunch of the European Higher Education Area, intended to give higher education policy the place it deserves in European debate, but equally to give European societies the kind of higher education they deserve and that they need for their future developments, will require a much more sustained debate on the kind of Europe we would like to have and the kind of education we will need to achieve our goal. This debate will need to be philosophical and practical at the same time, since it will need to establish a clear connection between principles, policy, and practice. That will hopefully (re)motivate the higher education community, the policy making community, and our community tout court. It is the kind of debate to which the present author has sought to contribute (Bergan 2011) and to which the following quote from the Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul is highly relevant: And so I ï¬nd our education is increasingly one aimed at training loyal employees, even though the state and the corporations are increasingly disloyal. What we should be doing is quite different. It turns on our ability to rethink our education and our public expectations so that we create a non-employee, non-loyal space for citizenship. After all, a citizen is by deï¬nition loyal to the state because the state belongs to her or him. That is what frees the citizen to be boisterous, outspoken, cantankerous and, all in all, by corporatist standards, disloyal. This is the key to the success of our democracy (Saul 2009)."
3,132,0.36,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"the transformation of education from a didactic process of information transfer to one of construction of knowledge. In this chapter, to provide context and to help the reader understand the seeming dichotomy of learning goals of scaffolding, I first situate scaffolding relative to the calls for the enhancement of content knowledge and higher-order thinking skills in the NGSS (Achieve, 2013; Krajcik, Codere, Dahsah, Bayer, & Mun, 2014; National Science Board, 2010) and the Common Core State Standards (McLaughlin & Overturf, 2012; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). Second, I expand on the intended learning outcomes of scaffolding. Variation in intended learning outcomes of scaffolding largely aligns with differences in the theoretical underpinnings of scaffolding, which were discussed in Chap. 2: âInstructional Scaffolding: Foundations and Evolving Definition.â I also explore if the effectiveness of scaffolding varies according to intended learning outcome, as informed by the meta-analysis results. Just as it is important to consider intended learning outcomes, it is also important to consider how learning is assessed (Belland, 2012; Belland, French, & Ertmer, 2009; Furtak & Ruiz-Primo, 2008; Messick, 1989). Indeed, one is often advised to consider assessment before even designing objectives and instructional materials/strategies (GagnÃ©, 1965; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). By considering how scaffoldingâs influence on cognitive outcomes varies according to how it is assessedâat the concept, principles, or application level (Sugrue, 1995)âone can see if scaffolding as a whole delivers stronger impacts on content learning or various types of higher-order thinking skills. It is important to consider this alongside the intended learning outcome, as (a) just because an intervention is designed to increase content learning or higherorder skills does not necessarily mean that it does, and (b) just because scholars claim that scaffolding is intended to help students enhance their skill in a particular area does not always mean that the learning is being assessed at that level. In this chapter, I discuss these ideas, and present meta-analysis results comparing scaffoldingâs impact according to intended learning outcome and assessment levels."

In the paper we argue that the understanding of an object (physical or non-physical) is greatly enhanced by the ability to measure that object. Indeed, Lord Kelvin suggested, over 100 years ago that : : : when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be."

Indeed, all of the authors reviewed here advocate the need for multi-disciplinary approaches even if they themselves resist the challenge. Having reviewed the approaches in the context of our much grounded action-research on professional voluntarism, we feel that the model that best ï¬ts the situation is that represented by the SI Framework. We are particularly attracted by the attention the economic âaction planâ approach pays to existing knowledge or âinformation banksâ and the effect this knowledge has on perceptions of what reality is and could be. We feel that this theory helps us to understand why so many interventions fail. Knowledge does not activate change: rather intentions organised through plans (and agency) drive and activate learning. And new learning builds connections between people and knowledge to create the conditions in which change can begin to be imagined and actioned. The emphasis on the collective and connected quality of active learning is also very helpful and encourages us to see beyond learning as an individualised process."

Yet, professors are frustrated at the start of courses when they have to backtrack to ensure that everyone has the same knowledge base. In the former degree system, they felt that students were able to build levels of knowledge with each course. Remediation and frustration merely adds additional burdens to the professorial role.

It is not so obvious why these topics may differ so much between the two groups, particularly as the two biology topics cover quite different aspects of the subject, one ecological and one covering human biology. It may be that the two Earth science topics, particularly Earthâs processes, cycles, and history, may be covered by Group 2 countries in subjects other than science, for example in geography. This may explain the importance of this topic in the clustering, although this cannot be said for certain. This clustering pattern and the ï¬nding that there are distinct groups of countries with similar curricula is consistent with other research, such as that conducted by Kjaernsli and Lie (2008), who investigated the achieved curriculum in different countries using item responses to TIMSS science questions for TIMSS 2003 data. This study also identiï¬ed a number of distinct groupings of countries that clustered together. Similar patterns have emerged on analysis of TIMSS mathematics data (Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2009; Zanini and Benton 2015).

The above mentioned standards (except from NCTM) are usually not subject matter speciï¬c. The NCTM standards have the merit of stressing the importance of teachersâ awareness of the technology added value for studentsâ learning mathematics as a ï¬rst step toward an efï¬cient ICT use. Research point of view: professional knowledge and skills addressed in scientiï¬c papers In this section we attempt to synthesize what professional competencies are considered by the researchers as important for using ICT by mathematics teachers. Surprisingly, references to standards, either national or international, are very rare. Only Bowers and Stephens (2011) mention the NCTM (2000) âTechnology Principleâ: each teacher should use technology in âappropriate and responsible waysâ (p. 286), which the authors interpret as âusing technology to explore mathematical relations.â (ibid.). The Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Mishra and Koehler 2006) is the most frequently used frame that offers âa helpful way to conceptualize what knowledge prospective teachers need in order to integrate technology into teaching practicesâ (Bowers and Stephens ibid). However, this framework allows for a variety of interpretations. While some authors attempt to deï¬ne speciï¬c TPACK knowledge pieces, others consider the TPACK rather as an orientation enabling the teacher educators âto develop a greater sense of how to plan and focus instruction for prospective math teachersâ (ibid. p. 301). The former approach is adopted by RobovÃ¡ (2013) who deï¬nes what she calls âSpeciï¬c Skills for work in GeoGebraâ, and she proposes a set of such skills instantiated to the case of functions: e.g., âmaking functions visible (on the screen)â or âusing dynamic features of GeoGebraâ. The latter approach is advocated by Bowers and Stephens (2011), who draw on literature review to claim that teachers need not acquire one particular expertise or pick one particular role; instead, teachers (and prospective teachers) need to become aware of how to design rich tasks that integrate technology into the classroom discourse so that technology-based conjectures and arguments become normative (p. 290)."

The Gestalt method of problem solving, then, is at the same time very different and very similar to the process of design. Gestalt psychology has not fared well during the evolution of cognitive psychology. Although it honours the work of the unconscious mind it does so at the expense of practicality. If learning is, indeed, entirely based on insight then there is little point in continuing to study learning. âWhen one begins by assuming that the most important cognitive phenomena are inaccessible, there really is not much left to talk aboutâ (Schoenfeld 1985, p. 273). However, of interest here is the Gestalt psychologistsâ claim that focus on problem solving methods creates functional ï¬xedness (Ashcraft 1989). Mason et al.

In Sects. 2.1 and 2.2 we outlined some general principles to guide sound assessment design. In this section, we report on a sampling of classroom assessment strategies that have been reported to help teachers develop assessments that make student understanding explicit and provide evidence of robust understanding. Kim and Lehrer (2015) use a learning progression oriented assessment system to aid teachers in developing tasks that help students make conceptual progress in a particular content domain. Their work entails developing construct maps that are the outcomes of a learning progression, assessment items intended to generate the types of reasoning identiï¬ed in the construct maps, scoring exemplars, and then lesson plans with contexts that enable students to engage with representations of the mathematics."
60,60,0.355,Research on Teaching and Learning Probability,"2.6.2 Effective Ways to Train Teachers Another line of research is designing and evaluating suitable and effective tasks that help in increasing the probabilistic and didactic knowledge of teachers. Some researchers describe different experiences directed towards achieving this goal. Teachers should engage with and analyse probability simulations and investigations. Simulations and experiments are recommended when working with students. To be able to use investigations in their own classrooms, teachers need competencies with this approach to teaching. When the time available for educating teachers is scarce, one possibility is to give teachers first a project or investigation to work with and, when finished, carry out a didactical analysis of the project. This type of analysis can help to simultaneously increase the teachersâ mathematical and pedagogical knowledge (Batanero et al. 2004). Teachers should engage with case discussions. Groth and Xu (2011) used case discussion among a group of teachers as a valuable strategy to educate teachers. The authors indicated that in teaching stochastics teachers navigate between two layers of uncertainty. On the one hand, uncertainty is part of stochastic knowledge; on the other hand, in any classroom uncertainty appears as a result of the dynamic interactions amongst teacher, students, and the topic being taught. Discussions among the teachers may help them to increase their knowledge since experiences with general pedagogy, mathematical content, and content-specific pedagogy can be offered and debated. Teachers also need experience planning and analysing a lesson. When teachers plan and then analyse a lesson devised to teach some content they develop their probabilistic and professional knowledge (Chick and Pierce 2008). Teachers need to understand the probability they teach to their students. One strategy is to have teachers play the role of a learner and afterwards analyse what they learnt. If they have the chance to go through a lesson as a learner and at the same time look at it from the point a view of a teacher, they may understand better how the lesson will unfold later in the classroom. Teachers should have extensive experience working with technology. We can also capitalise on technology as a tool-builder for teachers gaining a conceptual"

The next question is, what supports are needed to bring early algebra into classes taught by elementary teachers? Teachers need curricular materials. Over the last ï¬fteen years, a number of curricular programs have intentionally infused early algebra throughout the grades (Britt and Irwin 2011; Dougherty 2008; Goldenberg and Shteingold 2008; Schifter et al. 2008b). Some researchers have described how early algebra appears in the Japanese (Watanabe 2011) and Singaporean and Chinese (Cai et al. 2011) curricula. Other projects have published materials for teachers to supplement their regular programs (Carpenter et al. 2003; Russell et al. in press). However, research on teaching and curriculum has revealed that there is a substantial difference between curriculum as written and curriculum as enacted in the classroom. Among the factors that transform written curriculum into enacted curriculum are teachersâ beliefs and knowledge, their orientation to the curriculum, their own professional identities, and the school and classroom culture (Stein et al. 2007). Given these factors, prepared curricula may have limited impact on what happens in the classroom. Movement of early algebra into elementary classrooms requires professional development (Blanton and Kaput 2008; Dougherty 2008)."

To network theories means to build relations among theories. This approach is not a new idea. There are forerunners: for example, in 1992, Bauersfeld presented an integrated analysis of a teaching and learning situation using various theoretical approaches (1992b). He has also used strategies to compare and contrast radical constructivism and activity theory in order to clarify their (in-) compatibility (1992a). In 1998, Maier and Steinbring published a comparison of two theoretical approaches on processes of understanding based on the same empirical episode. These examples show that German researchers used the strategies of comparing theoretical approaches and integrating theoretical aspects to comprehend practice. Such strategies, called networking strategies, have been systematized, resulting in a landscape of four pairs of complementary strategies (Fig. 5.1). This landscape orders these strategies according to their potential for integration between two poles, non-relation of ignoring other theories, and uniï¬cation of theories globally. The ï¬rst two pairs (understanding and making understandable, comparing and contrasting), acknowledge the theoriesâ identities and the diversity of the theories as a resource in the ï¬eld. They point to the basic necessity of understanding theories. This ï¬rst pair may take place in a deepened way while comparing and contrasting theories. The second pair, comparing and contrasting, leads to awareness of differences and commonalities, thus learning from other perspectives. The third pair, combining and coordinating, is a step towards bridging theories. Its strategies allow working with different theories to build a conceptual framework or include complementary views into researching a problem. The fourth pair, locally integrating and synthesizing, leads to more comprehensive theoretical frameworks. Local integration may occur when a concept can be interpreted from different theoretical views, thus integrating the concept into other theories. Synthesizing is meant when two or more theories can be imbedded into a more holistic theoretical framework. While there are some cases of local integration, a case of synthesizing has not yet been achieved (see Bikner-Ahsbahs and Prediger 2010).

On the basis of our research and learning, we would argue that far from a skills deï¬cit we are in a situation of knowledge saturation; clinical skills/ information are not the primary problem and using clinical âexpertsâ as conduits for yet more skills-forcing interventions is neither efï¬cient nor effective. To the contrary, it is both arrogant and wasteful. This arrogance does not derive solely (although this certainly does contribute) to the imposition of âexpert informationâ from the global North: from wellmeaning but narrow thinking foreign clinical experts and âdonorsâ. It is the consequence of a failure to see the bigger picture â of narrowing disciplinary knowledge paradigms. Although the lack of patient management is recognised as an issue by all UK clinicians working in Uganda: it was a visiting Ugandan obstetrician who proposed the initiative to introduce the African Maternal Early Warning Score (AMEWS) into Mulago Hospital. Enthralled by its apparent success in the UK (visiting foreigners are often not exposed to or fail to see the fundamental weaknesses of UK systems) she quite understandably attempted a âpolicy transferâ approach: she âsawâ a clinical solution to a clinical problem and tried to transfer it.

Knowledge can be both enabling and disabling; it is not only a deï¬cit of skills/knowledge that hampers progress; narrow siloed knowledge (focused on harvesting facts) can limit our ability to see the social world and the truth that lies behind interventions. Resistance to change may be fuelled by knowledge and often quite entrepreneurial tacit localised knowledge. From an individual perspective â how to make ends meet and sustain your family â or, from a systems perspective â how to organise and funnel the rewards from systemic forms of corruption â requires a level of localised tacit knowledge and rational/entrepreneurial decision making that foreign volunteers may fail to âseeâ. The overall conclusion of this book, based on intense multi-method action-oriented research over a period of 8 years, is that international development initiatives in the form of Health Partnerships and through"

3,14,0.348,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"When considering problem-centered approaches to instruction, a central question has been how one can provide the support that students need to succeed in this environment. One cannot expect to teach students all of the strategies and content that they need through lecture or other approaches ahead of studentsâ engagement with the central problem (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980; Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Rather, support provided to students engaging in problem-centered instructional approaches needs to incorporate scaffolding, defined as interactive support that leverages what students already know to help them meaningfully participate in and gain skill at tasks that are beyond their unassisted abilities (Belland, 2014; Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2011; van de Pol, Volman, & Beishuizen, 2010; Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976). Such support leverages what students can already do to help them accomplish things that they would not be able to do otherwise, such as solve the central problem, design an artifact to address the problem, or complete a project (See Fig. 1.1). Scaffolding can be provided by teachers, peers, or computer tools (Belland, 2014; Pifarre & Cobos, 2010; van de Pol et al., 2010), but implementing problem-centered instruction in K-12 settings requires the use of computer-based scaffolding due to the high student-to-teacher ratios in most K-12 schools (Crippen & Archambault, 2012; Saye & Brush, 2002). Instructional scaffolding differs from other instructional support strategies and tools in terms of what students are intended to get out of it, the timing of the support, and the form of the support. First, scaffolding needs to support current performance but also lead to the ability to perform the target skill independently in the future (Belland, 2014; Wood et al., 1976). Thus, a calculator does not qualify as a scaffold because while it supports current performance, it cannot be reasonably expected to help users calculate independently (i.e., without the use of a calculator) more effectively in the future. Second, scaffolding is used while students engage with an authentic/ill-structured problem (Belland, 2014; Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1989; Wood et al., 1976). Modeling a strategy, lecturing to students, or otherwise instructing about strategies or content before engagement with problems does not qualify as scaffolding. Third, scaffolding needs to (a) build off of what students already know and (b) be tied to ongoing assessment of"
3,15,0.347,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"student abilities (Graesser, Bowers, Hacker, & Person, 1997; van de Pol et al., 2010; Wood et al., 1976). Thus, simply telling students what to do or how to do it does not qualify as scaffolding, because the former approach does not elicit and build off of what students already know. Such an approach is not often tailored to studentsâ individual needs. Fourth, scaffolding needs to simplify some task elements but also retain and highlight the complexity of other task elements (Reiser, 2004; Simons & Ertmer, 2006). This is so as to make meaningful participation in the task possible, but also to focus student attention on the subsets of the problem that will lead to the desired learning and promote the type of productive struggle that is the highlight of effective scaffolding interventions (Belland, Glazewski, & Richardson, 2011; Reiser, 2004; Simons & Ertmer, 2006). Without such struggle, productive learning from scaffolding cannot happen. Scaffolding can be provided by teachers, computers, or peers (Belland, 2014; Hawkins & Pea, 1987; Hogan & Pressley, 1997; Lutz, Guthrie, & Davis, 2006; Pifarre & Cobos, 2010; van de Pol et al., 2010). Each of these scaffolding types form an important part of an overall scaffolding system (Belland, Gu, Armbrust, & Cook, 2013; Helle, TynjÃ¤lÃ¤, & Olkinuora, 2006; Puntambekar & Kolodner, 2005; Saye & Brush, 2002). That is, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each can compensate for that of the others, forming a strong network of instructional support for students."

An ECNatSci related that one former student explained to him, ââWell, now Iâm all just thinking aboutâ-whatever the module he was taking at the time, and âI have no idea about [your class] anymore.â Itâs this way of thinking inside little boxes and you also notice this.â Another ECNatSci said, You could argue that that has always been the case, simply because we teach these things as separate subjects. But I think thereâs modularization and especially the fact that you have to do an exam at the end of each module, it contributes to this. I think somewhat it leads to a fragmentation of the studentâs view of [my discipline]. When you give lectures like [an] introduction to [course] lecture, when you give lectures and you refer to something that they should have or that they have heard before or in a lecture parallel about, letâs say, [a different course]. You just look into blank faces or at least from 90 % of them. Itâs so boxed in the knowledge, there is no concept that ultimately, it all hangs together and so what you learn in [the different course] has relevance for what I tried to teach them in [this course] and they are connected."

As such, monitoring refers to looking for and utilizing feedback to reassess oneâs goal orientation, metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, and metacognitive choice in order to âmanageâ a changing environment (Haynie and Shepherd 2009: 700). Learning to Think Metacognitively Over the past decade, researchers have explored various instructional approaches that harness metacognition to improve reasoning (Kramarski et al. 2001). Mevarech and Kramarski (1997) created an instructional method to help students enhance their mathematical reasoning by developing their metacognitive skills through four types of questions based on (1) comprehension, (2) connection, (3) strategy, and (4) reflection (Mevarech and Kramarski 2003: 469). We refer to these questions as âmetacognitive questionsâ as they are used to stimulate learnersâ metacognition. First, comprehension questions are intended to encourage one to think about whether he or she really understands the nature of a particular problem before starting to address it. This understanding forms from carefully considering the situation such that one identifies a problem, its nature, and its implications. The following are examples of questions encouraging students to think about comprehension: What is the core of the problem? What is the key question asked? What meanings do the key concepts convey? Second, connection questions are intended to encourage students to think about a particular problem in terms of its similarities and differences with problems he or she has faced and solved before. These questions urge students to draw on existing knowledge and experiences without generalizing from them too much. Questions like the following prompt learners to think about these connections: How can I relate this problem to problems I addressed previously? In what ways does this problem differ from those I worked on in the past, and how does it differ? Third, strategic questions are intended to encourage students to think about which strategies are most suitable for solving a problem and why. These questions urge learners to contemplate the what, why, and how underlying their approach to a problem. The following are examples of strategic questions: What is the strategy/tactic/principle best suited for me to address this problem? Why is this strategy/tactic/principle so particularly appropriate? How can I put together information I need for solving the problem? How can I realize the plan?"
25,30,0.346,Teaching and Learning About Whole Numbers in Primary School,"in the problem presented above). When the relation and the operation were consistent, 92.5 % of the responses were correct; when the relation and the operation were inconsistent, 72.5 % of the responses were correct. Thus students must learn not only that addition can be conceived as the inverse of subtraction and vice versa, but also that the relation âmore thanâ can be conceived as the inverse of âless thanâ and vice versa. Thompson (1993) rightly pointed out that much of the research on additive reasoning includes only three pieces of information, usually either (1) two quantities connected by a transformation, (2) two quantities combined into a total quantity, or (3) two quantities and a relation between them. He explored the difï¬culty of problems that had structures different from these basic ones but still used the same part-whole relations. In his problems, there was typically more information, and some of the information about quantities had to be deduced from the information about relations. We have no quantitative data from his studies, and space does not permit the inclusion of his fascinating qualitative descriptions. Thus we provide quantitative information from a study by Nunes et al. (2015), who gave a quantitative reasoning assessment to a sample of over 1000 students in the age range 10â11 years in England. A problem that involved four quantities and three relations was: âKate, Donna, and Jamie shared some stickers between them. Altogether they bought 22 stickers. Donna got 3 more than Kate and Jamie got 4 more than Kate. How many did each of them have?â It was noted that all the relations here were additive. The value of only one quantity is given: the total number of stickers. The value of the parts is not given, only the relations between the parts. The arithmetic required to solve this problem is quite simple, but the web of relations between the quantities is complex because the quantities of stickers that Donna and Jamie had were described in relation to the quantity that Kate had. This problem was solved correctly by only 31 % of the students. The inescapable conclusion from the brief review of studies carried out here is that one must indeed distinguish arithmetic from quantitative reasoning. The level of difï¬culty of problems cannot be described by the difï¬culty of the arithmetic calculations. Quantitative reasoning must become part of the themes addressed in mathematics education curricula. Moreover, quantitative reasoning cannot be conceived simply as the application of procedures learned to solve arithmetic computations. Additive reasoning develops throughout the primary school years (Thompson 1993; Vergnaud 1979, 1982) and must be seen as a domain of teaching and learning on its own; students need to learn to reason about relations between quantities in order to solve problems, not only about arithmetic. Before we turn to research about teaching quantitative reasoning, we consider research on multiplicative reasoning."

If there is a free performance of Hamlet in our city, why do not use it as a resource for the subject of literature, especially if Shakespeare is in the curriculum? In a similar way, experts on particular topics are the best people to explain certain concepts. A doctoral student who is carrying out their Ph.D. in the area of genetic research might be very inspiring for secondary education students during their biology class. This was the context for the work of the iTEC project which we report here. It contributed to the conception of the classroom of the future, in which technology is complemented with innovative pedagogical approaches, which entail a high degree of dynamism in educational practice.

The student has a learner domain space of knowledge that only partly overlaps, or not at all, with the expert domain space of knowledge, which is the space that contains all possible hypotheses a learner can generate about a problem. Knowledge building during inquiry learning can be considered as expanding the learner domain space to increase that overlap (Lazonder et al. 2008)."

In reality, it is difï¬cult to reconstruct the basic cognitive elements that lie behind an overt solution process. Looking at Veronikaâs solution, it is not clear whether she followed a procedural solution conducted mentally but mechanically or recognized the number characteristics and based her solution on number knowledge and number sense. In order to describe her mental calculation abilities more precisely, it would be critical to know which cognitive elements her solution entails. Cognitive elements are not sufï¬cient to ï¬nd the answer to a computation; they rely on additional tools that are used and combined in the given context to solve the problem. The speciï¬c tools for solution may involve counting, referring to basic facts, or employing adaptive strategic means (Rathgeb-Schnierer and Green 2013). Strategic means are devices that modify complex problems to make them easier. Such strategic means can be combined in flexible ways and include, for example, decomposing and composing (65 + 28 = 60 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 3), transforming a problem (46 â 19 = 47 â 20), deriving the solution from a known problem (if 7 joined with 7 equals 14, the answer to 7 joined with 8 equals 15, since 8 is one more than 7), and using decade analogies (if 4 joined with 5 is 9, 40 joined with 50 must be 90). Whenever an arithmetic problem is solved, all three dimensions are involved. Thus the model can be used as a theoretical framework to analyze studentsâ solution processes and to identify their mental competences. The fruitfulness of the use of the model as an analytic frame is exempliï¬ed in the analysis of Michaelâs solution of the subtraction problem 71 â 36: Michael:"

269,41,0.341,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"(Dussauge and Kaiser 2012), the people and publications assembled around âcritical neuroscienceâ (e.g. Choudhury, Nagel, and Slaby 2009; Choudhury and Slaby 2012; Critical Neuroscience n.d.), the field of neuropsychoanalysis (Solms and Turnbull 2011; Fotopoulou, Pfaff and Conway 2012), the Association of Neuroesthetics (Association of Neuroesthetics 2015), the BIOS centre at the London School of Economics (BIOS 2015), as well as various âNeurohumanitiesâ programmes in prestigious universities (Hagouel 2012). We conjecture that that moment is no longer alive in quite the same way. It is certainly not that the avenues for interdisciplinary research have suddenly narrowed, but rather that the horizon of interdisciplinary possibility, in 2015â2016, is not quite the same as it was in, say, 2008â 2009. Our hunch is that the sense of possibility that we witnessed has moved to other, currently âsexierâ, biosocial fields. We think here, for example, of epigenetics (Landecker and Panofsky 2013) or metabolomics (Levin 2014). It is noteworthy that neither the ENSN nor the European Platform exists any longer (although a group of junior researchers, based primarily at Kingâs College London, is attempting to resuscitate a âNeuroscience and Society Networkâ â see Mahfoud and Maclean 2015). In our particular neck of the woods, it is noticeable that there now appear to be more large, grant-funded interdisciplinary projects that address the terrain of the brain and the mind (e.g. Hearing the Voice and Hubbub), and fewer specially designed âplatformsâ or programmes to train cohorts of researchers competent in at least two disciplines (though note graduate programmes, such as the Berlin School of Mind and Brain, committed to training interdisciplinary researchers). None of which is at all to say that such opportunities are now entirely foreclosed â or that nothing remains for the would-be junior collaborator save the unenviable labour of shaving the rough edges from an earlier, open, precarious moment, now sadly passed. But there is a temporality, as well as a momentum, of openness and closure around specific interdisciplinary fields. For those interested in collaboration around the brain and mind, itâs worth asking the question: What kind of moment are we actually in now in the relationship between the neurosciences and the social sciences? How might the specific dynamics and constellations of that moment shape how interdisciplinarity is imagined and practised?"
223,84,0.341,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"perspectives. In modernity it is also recognized that there is not just one single type of rationality but different types, which cannot be reduced to each other. Each type determines its own principles. Developing Kantâs ideas about theoretical, practical, and aesthetic rationality further, Habermas (1984) paradigmatically distinguished between cognitive, moral, and aesthetic rationality. Habermas built not only on Kantâs work but also on that of Max Weber, who first made rationality a key concept in modernistic thinking and used the term specifically in the sense of purposive rationality or economic rationality, the meaning it is also often has in colloquial language. It thereby denotes the strategic choice of the best means to reach a certain goal. In this way rational decision-making became of central interest and positioned rationality and action theory as core concepts in high modernity. Weber elaborated the role of rationality for individual everyday actions and called attention to the tendency toward disenchantment, that is, toward continuous differentiation and rationalization. Rationalization in this sense designates a historical drive toward a world in which âone can, in principle, master all things by calculationâ (Weber, 1919/1946, p. 136), by rational decision-making. This process of rationalization was not limited to the economic sphere but was extended with its own rational logics also to law and administration, the social and political spheres, and other domains. As a prerequisite, a peculiarly rational and intellectual type of personality or person of vocation was presupposed. Modern scientific and technological knowledge slowly pushed back the germinating grounds of human knowledge, such as religion and metaphysics, and created a culture of âobjectificationâ (Versachlichung). At the same time, there was a loss of substantive-value rationality, the emergence of a polytheism of value fragmentation, and the related tensions between these two developments, in other words, rationality without reason in practice. It is in this framework that one must also situate geographical action theory as put forward by Benno Werlen (Chap. 2, in this volume or 1987, 1995, 1997) in the phenomenological tradition of Alfred SchÃ¼tz (1932). According to this school of thought, the internal mental intentionality directed to outer objects is what ascribes meanings to these objects, as people do through their everyday place-making and everyday spatially differentiated actions. This geographic action theory can be interpreted as the subjectivist version of what Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Savigny (2001) and Reckwitz (2002) designated as the mentalist paradigm in social theory. This approach contrasts with the objectivist version of mentalism, which stems from classical structuralism as exemplified by de Saussure (1916/1972) in linguistics, LÃ©vy-Strauss (1969) in anthropology, Althusser (1965/2005) and Emerson (1984) in Marxist economics, and Piaget (1970) in psychology. One could also add the more contemporary version of psychological structuralism (Lacan, 2002); behaviorist psychology (Skinner, 1938; Watson, 1913); and cognitive psychology (e.g., Broadbent, 1987), including cognitive linguistics (Fauconnier, 1999). The approach diverges from behavioral geography (Golledge & Stimson, 1996) as well, for which human behavior is an effect of structures in the unconscious mind in relation to structured situations and is thus part of the objectivist mentalist tradition."

This kind of engagement is much rarer in higher education because the focus is on the ways in which students develop understandings that transcend the existing knowledge domains of higher education. One example is the independent studies degrees that used to exist in the UK in which students negotiated their own programmes of study in order to address a problem that they had identiï¬ed that they wanted to solve (Robbins 1988). The rarity of this kind of engagement in the formation of understanding is unsurprising, as it challenges the nature of academic knowledge and the role of academics in making this accessible to students."

333,33,0.34,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"We draw on the example of EcoMOBILE (Ecosystems Mobile Outdoor Blended Immersive Learning Environment), which provides a learning experience in which students access virtual information and simulated experiences (Augmented Reality-AR) while immersed in real world ecosystems in studentsâ own area (Kamarainen et al. 2015). This science education project was designed to complement the EcoMUVE curriculum, which is based on Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) experienced on computers in the classroom. Within the EcoMUVE environment, students investigate ecosystems and collect data in immersive simulated ecosystems. This environment is designed to help students learn the system dynamics and complexity within ecosystems and causal relationships from introducing or changing something to, or within, the system. In their work, students collected data using smartphones from a local ï¬eld trip to nearby pond and brought their data and ï¬eld notes back to the classroom for further investigation in the virtual pond within the EcoMUVE system. In their work in next-generation virtual reality interfaces for mathematics and geometry education Kaufmann and Schmalstieg (2003) developed a three-dimensional geometric construction tool called Construct 3D. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) to provide a natural setting for face-to-face collaboration between teachers and students. All construction steps are carried out via direct manipulation in 3D using a stylus tracked with six degrees of freedom. AR affords users to see their own body and hand as well as the effects of their actions while working, so the construction process physically involves the students and resembles handcraft more than traditional computer operation. The possible opportunities using AR in combination with dynamic geometry components has the possibility to create further advancements in mathematics education research. These advancements could include student interactions with 3D objects in the world that may have a particular feature of interest to be shared and investigated within the classroom."

The task to raise ethically aware citizens for the benefit of society has been an almost self-evident, taken for granted part of their self-understanding. However, during recent decades, there has been a clear change in the narrative concerning the third mission. The perspective has shifted from understanding it as a more or less implied by-product of teaching and research to emphasizing it expressly as a task in itself to be promoted and furthered. The shift of emphasis is obviously a consequence of profound changes in society and the wider world. There is a growing insight into the central role of education and research in the globalized knowledge society. The competitiveness of societies is seen as directly connected with the manner in which they can position themselves within the framework of production and use of knowledge. With the accelerating production of knowledge, the ability to access, create, and use knowledge becomes a key success factor. The role of universities is crucial in creating such ability. They are key players in the knowledge production and dissemination game, and therefore impact societies and economies in many ways. Besides educating both new leaders and workforce, and creating and supporting innovations, they are often pivotal players in importing new knowledge into societies more generally, in attracting new brains from other countries, and in introducing new patterns of thinking and being into societies. Globally, universities are also perceived as perhaps the most important producers of knowledge which is urgently needed to cope with the grand challenges that mankind is currently facing. As is clear in the final statement from the UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education 2009 [3]: Higher education has the social responsibility to advance our understanding of multifaceted issues. It should lead society in generating global knowledge to address global challenges, inter alia, food security, climate change, water management, intercultural dialogue, renewable energy and public health."

15,60,0.337,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","non-standard. This domain has what she describes as âhigh use value/no exchange valueâ. Domain Two numerate practices are linked to an individualâs âcommon senseâ, their invisible mathematics (Coben 2000) and thus are not always obvious to the individual. Other alternative views of the numeracy domain have been put forward. Three numeracy lenses were identified by Kanes (2002), visible numeracy broadly associated with common mathematical concepts, processes, language which Coben situates in Domain 1 (Coben 2006); usable numeracy is the numeracy of real life problem solving situated in Cobenâs view in Domain 2. Kanes construct of constructible numeracy is âproduced by an individual/social constructive process usually in a learning situationâ (p. 342) depending on the circumstances could be located within either Domain 1 or Domain 2. Coben (2006) combined the Domain 1/Domain 2 matrix with the degree of numeracy concept sophistication continuum and suggested that it is possible to position different conceptualisations of numeracy horizontally in terms of concept sophistication and vertically depending on the discursive domain in which they operate. This approach is problematic as it superimposes an operational axis on a conceptual axis. It is not the conceptualisation of numeracy that should be classified but rather its implementation in practice. Revisiting Cobenâs (2006) approach it is possible to reconceptualise her framework in a more meaningful way. Domain 1 and Domain 2 might be better considered outputs of informal or formal processes of an individualâs numeracy development and view the Domain1 and Domain 2 matrix as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of a particular conceptualisation of numeracy in practice. All provision must have the potential from an individualâs perspective to have high use/high exchange value (Fig. 2.2). The evaluation must be completed from the perspective of individual adult learners at whom the provision is aimed, as the perceived usefulness and value will be influenced by the starting point and motivation of the adult learner. In a situation where an adult is returning to adult basic education for the first time a conceptualisation of numeracy as a component of literacy (Formative phase) may well suit their needs. In many countries adult basic education is positioned on a national qualifications framework and could be classified as having high exchange value but with excellent teaching it can also have high use value for the individual learners. Curricula are interpreted and translated into learning opportunity by teachers who play a pivotal role in ensuring high use value to all adult learners. As a dynamic concept numeracy can, and perhaps should, be reconceptualised as adults develop their numerate behaviour during their lifelong learning journey. Although the subject of initial teacher education for mainstream teachers is well documented in the literature this is much less information on what constitutes excellent adult numeracy teacher education (Morton et al. 2006). FitzSimons (1996) describes the heterogeneity that is characteristic of the teachers in further education in mathematics. She found that there were mathematically highly qualified teachers in practice as well as teachers with low mathematics qualifications,"

287,27,0.336,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"The central concept of activity has been described as âthe speciï¬cally human form of activity, of interaction with the world in which man changes it and himself at the same timeâ (Giest and Lompscher 2006, p. 27, translated). Activity takes place through the conscious influence of a subject on an object in order to shape the latter in accordance with the motive of the activity. To this end, such actions (material or spiritual) are performed within one activity line that each time realises certain sub-goals through to the ultimate product of the activity. At the same time, the concept of operation serves to further distinguish another form of subordinate activity that differs from actions by the fact that operations result from concrete conditions for action and pass in an automated manner without conscious control or goal formation. These represent shortened actions. In the course of their lives, humans, in their confrontations with the world, develop various forms of activity, such as play, work, or learning activities that feature different characteristics in each case. For schools and for didactic research, the concept of learning activity has been of key importance. There, learning activity has been understood âas the activity aimed speciï¬cally at acquiring social knowledge and competence (learning topics) for which purpose speciï¬c means (learning resources) under specially arranged conditions have to be adopted.â (Giest and Lompscher 2006, p. 67, translated). According to Lompscher (1985), three essential subjective requirements must be met on the part of the learners to achieve a learning activity:"
223,32,0.336,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"the key criterion for distinguishing between direct and mediated experiences and between face-to-face and mediated communication, the three main foci of this bookâaction, knowledge, and spaceâare conceptualized in a new framework, the socially constructed relations of space. The geographer Huib Ernste illustrates in his chapter that the divorce of rationality and reason during the philosophical development of modernity led to recognition of different types of rationality, each with its own logics of deliberation and argumentation. Poststructuralists emphasize that each rationality contains multiple paradigms, each establishing its own set of principles, institutions, and lines of conflict that need to be taken into account. He demonstrates how these views are intricately involved in late-modern geographical theories of action and in language-pragmatic approaches25 in geography. Proponents of poststructuralist approaches emphasize the structural aspects of discourse, especially power structures. Laclau and Mouffe (1985), by contrast, try to retain and restore the possibility of deliberative interventions in these discursive structures by inverting Foucaultâs power/knowledge equation. Ernste explores the extent to which this inversion reinstates responsible and rational spatial decisions and actions as a focus of research in human geography. In his view rationality could be reconstituted as a culturally contingent phenomenon, and critical geographical analysis could again contribute to concrete problem-solving, albeit in a culturally much more informed and embedded way than hitherto. Ernste also discusses geographical action theory as put forward by Werlen (1987, 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1997, 2010a, 2010b, 2013, 2015; see also Werlenâs Chap. 2 in this volume) in the phenomenological tradition of SchÃ¼tz (1932). According to that school of thought, the internal mental intentionality directed to outer objects is what ascribes meanings to these objects, as people do through their everyday place-making and everyday spatially differentiated actions. Ernste interprets this geographic action theory as the subjectivist version of what Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Savigny (2001) and Reckwitz (2002) designated as the mentalist paradigm in social theory. This approach contrasts with the objectivist version of mentalism, which stems from classical structuralism. Ernste shows that the advent of poststructuralist thinking ushered in a great reluctance to conceptualize human behavior as conscious rational actions and that the term action is generally avoided in most poststructuralist literature. Talking about practice instead of action indeed amounts to a novel picture of human agency and rationality (Reckwitz, 2008, p. 98). In contrast to Benno Werlen, with his subjective, meaning-oriented approach to geographical action theory, and unlike Zierhofer (2002), who advocated the language-pragmatic approach in geography, poststructuralist thinkers do not tend to place structures inside the mind or in pragmatic procedures of interaction but rather âoutsideâ bothâin chains of signs, in symbols, discourse, or text. Pragmatics is âa branch of linguistics dealing with language in its situational context, including the knowledge and beliefs of the speaker and the relationship and interaction between speaker and listenerâ (âPragmatics,â 2010)."
245,676,0.336,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"courses are often called âhybridâ or âblended learningâ courses (Charlier et al. 2006a). Faced with these changes, actors can rarely call upon research that goes beyond feedback from experience, case studies or satisfaction surveys to guide their action (Deschryver 2008). However, existing research in educational technology, cognitive psychology, adult education and university education, if they are considered together, provide a potentially relevant theoretical and methodological framework to answer the two fundamental research questions: â¢ How do student characteristics and those of digital learning environments interact? â¢ What are the conï¬gurations emerging from these interactions that can lead to quality learning? These research questions reflect a systemic perspective in which human learning is part of a circular causality system between three sets of characteristics (Fig. 1): (1) relating to individual students, (2) relating to the digital learning environment, and (3) resulting from the interaction between the two. These so-called âprocessâ features generate learning outcomes (4) that in turn influence individual and environmental characteristics. This perspective reflects a circular (i.e. non-linear) systemic model of learning developed by social-cognitive learning theory (Bandura 1986); (Zimmerman 2002). This theory sets the act of learning in a system of reciprocal causality between personal characteristics (cognitive, emotional, and biological, i.e. unique to each learner) and environmental factors (organizational, human, cultural, material, etc.). Such circular causality models, now widely recognized in Adult Education (Cross 1981) and in higher education studies (Tinto 1975), (Biggs 2003), should necessarily guide research methods aimed at understanding the effects of digital learning environments (characterized and differentiated) on the learning of individuals. In what follows, we briefly summarize recent research results that could lay the foundations for this research."

So it seems that more fundamental microphysical theories should always be preferred over phenomenological ones. Yet, good arguments exist that this is not always a viable strategy. Anderson, for instance, points out [13] that âthe ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. . . . The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. The behaviour of large and complex aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in terms of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few particles. Instead, at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of the new behaviours requires research which I think is as fundamental in its nature as any other.â One pointy statement of Maxwell was related to his treatment of gas dynamics, in particular by taking only the mean values of quantities involved, as well as his implicit assumption that the distribution of velocities of gas molecules is continuous [234, p. 422]: âBut I carefully abstain from asking the molecules which enter where they last started from. I only count them and register their mean velocities, avoiding all personal enquiries which would only get me into trouble.â Pattee argues that a hierarchy theory with at least two levels of description might be necessary to represent these conundra [384, p. 117]: âThis is the same conceptual problem that has troubled physicists for so long with respect to irreversibility. How can a dynamical system governed deterministically by time-symmetric equations of motion exhibit irreversible behaviour? And of course there is the same conceptual difficulty in the old problem of free will: How can we be governed by inexorable natural laws and still choose to do whatever we wish? These questions appear paradoxical only in the context of single-level descriptions. If we assume one dynamical law of motion that is time reversible, then there is no way that elaborating more and more complex systems will produce irreversibility under this single dynamical description. I strongly suspect that this simple fact is at the root of the measurement problem in quantum theory, in which the reversible dynamical laws cannot be used to describe the measurement process. This argument is also very closely related to the logicianâs argument that any description of the truth of a symbolic statement must be in a richer metalanguage (i.e., more alternatives) than the language in which the proposition itself is stated.â StÃ¶ltzner and Thirring [489, 493, 529], in discussing Heisenbergâs Urgleichung, which today is often referred to as Theory of Everything [34], at the top level of a âpyramid of laws,â suggest three theses related to a âbreakdownâ to lower, phenomenologic, levels: â(i) The laws of any lower level . . . are not completely determined by the laws of the upper level though they do not contradict them. However, what looks like a fundamental fact at some level may seem purely accidental when looked at"

The contradiction resurges between the specificity of fiction and the generality of academic research (M2). In order to reconcile the two, established social psychology must be sublated (in the Hegelian sense of the term Aufheben) by combining the experimental method with the âspecificity principleâ, so that social psychology becomes sensitive to the complexities, nuances and idiosyncrasies of everyday life. It would also entail a reconciliation of social psychology with the genres of the imagination practiced by Stapel during the pre-academic stage of his career. In other words the specificity principles aims to achieve a negation of the negation, a convergence of the quest for general cognitive mechanism (social psychology) with a radical openness to the transient theatre of everyday existence, bringing social psychology on a higher level of complexity (M3). But unfortunately, this third moment proves unreachable (M2 â | M3) so that his project of transforming (sublating) the paradigm falters. The reconciliation of social psychological theory and everyday phenomena proves unattainable. More precisely, Stapel is unable to overcome the tension between reality as a littered, messy, disorderly environment and the mapping techniques of social psychology. He keeps looking for the causal factor x which allows us to address a problem by pushing a button, but this presupposes that the world is as makeable and modifiable as the behaviour of test animals in research facilities. While aiming to develop a level of specificity comparable to novelists or playwrights, Stapel continues to turn research subjects into lab rats in a labyrinth. But the human world proves too recalcitrant and transient to be captured in Stapelâs mousetraps. This leads to discontent and stagnation ($). The publication factory falters. This crisis precedes his misconduct. Fabrication and falsification are desperate efforts of a craving subject to remain faithful to the logic of the established paradigm, so that the infringement could be seen as a desperate act of fidelity, committed in response to the fact that the social psychological fact-fabricating factory as such is faltering. But social psychology fails to realise a cleansing of reality, so that it is ironical that the normative trinity eventually calls for a âcleansing operationâ to clean up the Stapelgate mess. Could journal articles such as Stapelâs Science paper (a fingered, fabricated story) be regarded as a piece of fiction, a Zola-like, literary experiment? This interpretation is negated by the decidedly dichotomous or even stereotypical style of thinking of Stapelâs paper (clean versus littered environments, prejudiced versus non-prejudiced subjects, etc.), while novelists and playwrights tend to depict a greyer and more ambiguous ambiance. The stereotyping inherent in social psychology itself is a mental cleaning device for cleaning up the messy chaos of reality. Stapel becomes a novelist only in his subsequent, post-traumatic effort to overcome the crisis, namely via writing Derailment as a âtherapeuticâ practice of the Self, an auto-pathography which at least partly allows him to overcome his Î´Î¹ÎµÏÏÎ¯ÏÎ¸Î·Î¼ÎµÎ½ (Aristophanes), his Spaltung (as discussed in Chaps. 2 and 8), while being sufficiently âspecificâ to acknowledge realityâs messiness.

An instructional approach grounded in activity theory takes a decidedly postmodern approach, in that it allows for multiple approaches and recognizes the importance of individual perspectives and those of members of the culture in which the student is operating (Friesen, 2012; Hlynka, 2012; Solomon, 2000). Furthermore, such an approach would welcome the type of critique and dialogue that one would expect to see in a scientific laboratory or conference/publishing venue. Thus, such approaches would likely involve addressing a central, ill-structured problem (Jonassen, 2011; Jonassen & Rohrer-Murphy, 1999). Furthermore, students would be provided considerable latitude to address the problem in the manner that best suited them."

When students commence their university education, they experience ontological shifts and identity transformations that may be akin to âpassing through a portalâ and an âopening up of a new and inaccessible way of thinking about somethingâ (Meyer and Land 2005). Threshold Concepts, as deï¬ned by Meyer and Land (2003) are âthresholdâ because they have features that are transformative, irreversible, integrative, bounded, potentially troublesome, discursive and reconstitutive. We acknowledge that there are many threshold concepts that come into play when becoming a student, including those relating to language, knowledge creation, theories, frameworks, writing, creativity and many more. We focus speciï¬cally here on aspects of the liminal space experienced by those who are learning to be a student, rather than identifying the speciï¬c threshold concepts themselves. Once a student registers at a university and begins a speciï¬c programme of study, there are multiple thresholds and transitions that students must negotiate in order to successfully complete their university journey within the particular programme. We consider what happens when students at all levels, across all programmes, are positioned in a higher education transitional space that requires the crossing of interwoven and multilayered thresholds. For us, the theory of Threshold Concepts and Liminality (Meyer and Land 2003) captures the processes of a university journey, the pivotal stage-like trajectories4 of a university experience. Liminality reflects the transitions (positive and negative, smooth and choppy) that transform old to new being and learning along the student journey. Liminality helps us better comprehend the complex and multi layered nature of a university experience; it helps to understand and support transitions or âtransformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape â¦ [and] world viewâ (Meyer and Land 2003, p. 1). In this paper, we aim to capture and qualify the transitional process characterised by liminality and explore its potential to influence practice for all stakeholders within higher education. This area of study has previously received little attention in a European student experience context. We draw on empirical data collected through an institution-wide student experience survey (SES) conducted at University College, Cork (UCC). The UCC SES aims to capture âclose-upâ expectations, perceptions, hopes and aspirations of students at all stages and at all levels of the student journey."

17,13,0.334,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"and on being able to control or possess it (âgetting itâ). Thus these metaphors presuppose a static âbankingâ model, interpreting understanding as the acquisition, ownership or possession of knowledge (Sfard 1998). But secondly, there is an ideological assumption that understanding a concept or skill is better, deeper and more valuable than simply being able to use or perform it successfully. Skemp (1976) distinguished ârelational understandingâ from âinstrumental understandingâ, and posited the superiority of the former. However his co-originator of the distinction Mellin-Olsen (1981) used it to distinguish the modes of thinking of academic students from that of apprentices, thus bringing in a social context and even a social class dimension to the distinction, and imposing less of an implicit received valuation. If we want to assert the superiority of relational understanding over instrumental understanding it needs to be done on the basis of a reasoned argument, and not taken for granted as obvious. Skempâs own argument was based on the psychology of schemata, based on Piagetian theories, but this have been challenged by a number of alternate theories of learning including socio-cultural theory and social constructivism, drawing on Vygotskyâs theory of learning. According to Vygotsky knowledge is not something that the learner possesses but is a competence inferred from the learnerâs manifested ability to complete a task, either unaided, or, with the help of a more capable other, in what is termed the learnerâs zone of proximal development. Given current challenges to the underlying theories of learning, the assumption that relational understanding is superior stands in need of justiï¬cation. Some scholars have challenged the unquestioned pre-eminence of relational understanding. Hossain et al. (2013) question the accepted good of the related notion of âunderstanding mathematics in-depthâ because, as they show, its role in the identity work of some student-teachers is troubling to them.1 for example, one student teacher with the pseudonym Lola experiences a conflict between the imposed good of relational understanding, when studying England, and her own success within the norms of instrumental understanding that she internalized in her Nigerian upbringing (Ernest in press). Others have challenged the uncritical promotion of understanding within the mathematics education community because of its incoherence. Llewellyn (2010) questions âunderstandingâ partly because of slippage in the use of the term so that it encompasses both its relational and instrumental forms. However, her deeper critique is that in use it carries with a whole host of problematic assumptions about who can own âunderstandingâ in terms of ability, gender, race, class. Understanding is produced as hierarchical, particularly in relation to gender, social class and ability. It belongs to the privileged few, the ânaturallyâ able, which are often boys (another unhelpful and unnecessary classiï¬cation). To suggest that girls have a âquest for understandingâ is over simplistic and gendered and in the ï¬rst instance we should unpack how each version of understanding is constructed. â¦ Finally I suggest that student teachers In later work Skemp (1982) refers to instrumental understanding as âsurfaceâ and relational understanding as âdeepâ understanding, thus preï¬guring the depth metaphor in the more recently coined term âunderstanding mathematics in-depthâ."
3,66,0.334,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"Plants, & Vye, 2003; The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990). It was designed to prevent the problem of inert knowledgeâknowledge that individuals know and can activate when asked to, but they do not spontaneously do so even when a presented problem warrants it (The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990). Anchored instruction seeks to promote broad transfer (Bottge, Rueda, Kwon, Grant, & LaRoque, 2007; The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990). Within anchored instruction, student learning is centered around several challenges, defined as mini problems that students need to address. Students are also given tools and information with which the challenges can be addressed. Typically, all information and tools that are needed to address the challenges are contained within the anchored instruction program (The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990). Students are encouraged to revisit challenges after they gather feedback from peers and teachers (Bransford et al., 2003; The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990). One of the key tenets of the situated learning theory is that all learning takes place in a context, and that to maximize the potential applicability of new learning, one should ensure that the learning context is similar to the context in which the new content is to be applied (Clancey, 2008; Lave & Wenger, 1991). By first observing and then participating at the edges of authentic work groups, students can gradually engage in legitimate peripheral participation, whereby they can gain the skills necessary to participate fully in the community of practice (Collins et al., 1989; Herrington & Oliver, 2000; Lave & Wenger, 1991). This is important such that learners have the contextual cues to access the schemas they create (Greeno & van de Sande, 2007; Lave & Wenger, 1991). Much research indicates that science learning outcomes are maximized when science curricula covers a smaller number of concepts at a deep level (Achieve, 2013; Clark, 2000; Duschl, 2008; National Research Council, 2007; Pritchard, Barrantes, & Belland, 2009). Specific learning outcomes to be developed include an understanding of science at a conceptual level (as opposed to a set of declarative facts) (Pritchard et al., 2009), learning of concepts and principles that apply across a variety of STEM fields (Achieve, 2013; National Research Council, 2011), and higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving (Abd-El-Khalick et al., 2004; Jonassen, 2000, 2011) and argumentation abilities (Belland, Glazewski, & Richardson, 2008; Ford, 2012; Kuhn, 2010)."
227,33,0.334,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Specializing is the process of getting to know the problem and how it behaves through the examination of special instances of the problem. This process is synonymous with problem solving by design and involves the repeated oscillation between the entry and attack phases of Mason et al. (1982) heuristic. The entry phase is comprised of âgetting startedâ and âgetting involvedâ with the problem by using what is immediately known about it. Attacking the problem involves conjecturing and testing a number of hypotheses in an attempt to gain greater understanding of the problem and to move towards a solution. At some point within this process of oscillating between entry and attack the solver will get stuck, which Mason et al. (1982) refer to as âan honourable and positive state, from which much can be learnedâ (p. 55). The authors dedicate an entire chapter to this state in which they acknowledge that getting stuck occurs long before an awareness of being stuck develops. They proposes that the ï¬rst step to dealing with being stuck is the simple act of writing STUCK! The act of expressing my feelings helps to distance me from my state of being stuck. It frees me from incapacitating emotions and reminds me of actions that I can take. (p. 56)"
139,273,0.334,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"The reader should notice our careful use of words in the previous paragraphs. We started out with modeling a very specific case, namely the spreading of a flu among pupils and staff at a boarding school. With purpose we exchanged words like pupils and flu with more neutral and general words like individuals and disease, respectively. Phrased equivalently, we raised the abstraction level by moving from a specific case (flu at a boarding school) to a more general case (disease in a closed society). Very often, when developing mathematical models, we start with a specific example and see, through the modeling, that what is going on of essence in this example also will take place in many similar problem settings. We try to incorporate this generalization in the model so that the model has a much wider application area than what we aimed at in the beginning. This is the very power of mathematical modeling: by solving one specific case we have often developed more generic tools that can readily be applied to solve seemingly different problems. The next sections will give substance to this assertion."

LPS, designed to complement other international studies such as the TIMSS Video Study, provided comparisons of mathematics lessons via analysis of lesson events during a sequence of lessons and multiple accounts, including the perspectives of the teacher and the learners. 2. Lessons events such as Kikan-Shido are lesson components found across different cultural systems. Although teachers in different cultural systems spend time on the same lesson event, they might be in fact carrying out activities with different meanings and functions. For example, the function of Kikan-Shido or between-desk instruction differed between teachers of different cultural systems. With the exception of the Japanese teachers, not all teachers make a strong link between the learning outcome of Kikan-Shido and the whole-class interaction episode. These lesson events were important components in classroom instruction with pedagogical functions and features, the feasibility of which may be further explored in other cultural systems. 3. Attempting to explain the Asian Learnerâs Paradox, the classrooms of Asian countries with a track record of better student performance, such as the Chinese classrooms, were sometimes the focus of investigation and comparison. The purpose of these studies is not to present a model for others to follow but rather to unfold an account of the enactment of mathematical tasks, through in-depth investigation of an effective case taking into account the many constraints (such as examination-orientation, content coverage, teaching pace, and large class size in a speciï¬c cultural system) and culturally rooted clues (such as the teacherâs conceptions and beliefs, the norm of the studentsâ expectation, the locally implemented pedagogical framework). 4. Seeking a common language for comparison has a speciï¬c implication for understanding effective instruction in different cultures. Both the TIMSS Video Study and the Learnerâs Perspective Study have chosen tasks as a unit for comparing and contrasting. Based on the quantitative comparison of âusing procedureâ problems and âmaking connectionsâ problems, the TIMSS Video Study indicated that there were unique features in the teaching and student experiences despite the similar representation of problems. In addition to the nature of tasks or curriculum materials, how the teachers and students implement the tasks is very important. Although sometimes a task may have objectives in alignment with the objectives of promoting mathematical processes and making connections, in some cases teachers turn it into the routine of promoting rote learning. Therefore, the teachersâ enactment of the teaching materials in alignment with the curriculum objectives is an important element of effective teaching (Stigler and Hiebert 2004). In addition, how the teacher sustains the intended roles of the tasks during implementation is also important (Cai 2005; Huang and Cai 2010). 5. Different kinds of tasks play different roles in the agenda of effective classroom instruction, as they are like the ingredients for preparing a mealâyet how the ingredients are cooked is important. The tasks employed in a lesson represent a model of mathematics as it is performed in that lesson (Mesiti and Clarke 2010). Among the many issues to be explored for effective classroom instruction, the"

Heitele (1975) suggested a list of fundamental probabilistic concepts that played a key role in the history of probability and are the basis for the modern theory of probability. At the same time, people frequently hold incorrect intuitions about their meaning or application in absence of instruction. This list includes the ideas of random experiment and sample space, the addition and multiplication rule, independence and conditional probability, random variables and distribution, combinations and permutations, convergence, sampling, and simulation.

328,51,0.332,a Philosophy of Israel Education : a Relational Approach,"programs, and the Israel experience have provided the Jewish community with the great hope for increased vitality (Soberman and Stewart 2015). These institutions are total or partial immersive environments where learning is advanced through setting, personnel, facilities, conversation, practice, ritual, and relationships, and they seem to have demonstrated a record of success. To be clear, the educational power of these programs derives not only from the amount of time, but more significantly from their immersiveness, from their capacity to submerge young people in a âtotalâ experience. It suggests that, if we are to do better at achieving the multi-dimensional outcomes of Israel education, we need to more effectively utilize the full immersive capacity of our educational institutions. In that sense, it can be said that Israel education should live in a broad totality of frameworks. It needs to totally permeate the lives of educational institutions: in mission statements, the consciousness of lay and professional leaders, formal and informal curricula, walls, halls, buses, music, holidays, and foods. Goffman believed that the non-verbal, non-cognitive, non-discursive elements of a culture are as important, or more so, for conveying cultural norms as the written word or the âclassroom lesson.â Numerous studies of unique school and other educational institutions across time and place echo this point1 (Bettelheim 1950; A.S. Neill 1970; Redl and Wineman 1957; Peshkin 1986). There is a notion often indigenous to schooling that there are core contents and âsubjectsâ which constitute âcurriculumâ, and there are clubs, sports, hobbies, arts, and culture which are âextracurricularâ or secondary activities that enrich and embellish. In fact, the reality may be just the opposite. Indeed, in Israel education, it is these âextrasâ that very often are the educational essence. Sometimes a song, a story, a person, a fable, a recipe, or a picture connected to Israel touches those thousands of neurons in the mind, which lead to feeling, thinking, and doing. The immersive approach to Israel education argues that the distinction between âextraâ and âcoreâ is not compelling, since people learn and are affected in diverse ways. Donât regard the fluff as extra trim; for some, it may be the entryway into the heart of the matter. Essentially, what is being suggested is that educators must learn to âthink immersivelyâ. Thinking immersively involves a sophisticated approach to education, which calls upon educators to co-opt a totality of senses, foci, and resources. Educators need to be cognizant of the conditions that constitute the given framework (ideological or denominational affiliation, size of institution, architecture of the institution, staff), and they should"
245,1255,0.332,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"Our analysis suggests that the university experience is shaped by multiple layers of interacting context (Palmer and Marra 2008). Within UCCâs setting, it would appear that, on the part of the student, there may be obstacles to happily achieving a new student identity, occasioning entry into âstuck placesâ. There may also be a form of âmimicryâ where thinking and acting are tacit or ritualised. In all cases, discursive, integrative and reconstitutive transitions or âchange of skinsâ characterise the learning process (Nin 1971, p. 26). The university experience is shifting, affective, embodied and emotional. Transforming student epistemologies, liberating students from that in which they were embedded, âmaking what was subject into objectâ so that they can âhave itâ, rather than âbe hadâ by it, is according to Kegan âthe most powerful way I know to conceptualise the growth of mindâ (Kegan 1994). Undergraduate and post graduate students in our study acknowledged that their university experience was discursive, integrative and reconstitutive: âGreat learning experienceâ; âOpened your mindâ; âAllowed them to make more informed decisions about the futureâ; âDifferent person at the end of collegeâ; âIncreased overall conï¬denceâ; âPreparation for the futureâ; âAlways stand to youâ (UCC Student 2009). Here, education is recognised as representing more than academic and professional outcomes. There is an openness to the nature of the student experience and the potential meaning making which weaves epistemological, intrapersonal and interpersonal threads. Further, learning is about âentrance into â¦a community of people who share that way of thinking and practisingâ (Davies, 2006 in Meyer and Land 2006, p. 71). A fourth year female student told us: âThere is a large community of academic people in this university all with the common interest of furthering our learning in our chosen ï¬eld. It is a very reassuring notion that you are surrounded by many like minded people with the same objective as you.â"

136,82,0.332,Principles and Practice of Case-Based Clinical Reasoning Education : a Method For Preclinical Students,"we will briefly review the traditional educational approaches used to prepare students for immersive clinical experiences and then describe a set of sequential teaching strategies one might consider prerequisites for clinical reasoning. This proposed sequence includes learning to talk like a physician, i.e., using the clinical vocabulary; identifying the clinical problem to be solved, often called problem representation; organizing case information and schema development, i.e., building oneâs illness script mental repository; comparing and contrasting diagnostic hypotheses, which we will call contrastive learning; identifying discriminating information for hypothesis-driven inquiry; and diagnostic verification to enrich oneâs mental repository for use in clinical reasoning. Preparing students to act in clinical rotations and to become involved with clinical reasoning and decision-making in practice is done in medical schools in very different ways, varying from virtually no practice with clinical reasoning to extensive training in lecture settings or small groups, using real or standardized patients, or with written or electronic cases. Traditionally, most medical schools require students to participate in introductory courses designed to teach clinical skills, such as communicating with patients, the medical interview, the physical examination, and clinical reasoning. Some of these courses are described in the literature (LaRochelle et al. 2009). The most common approach involves a longitudinal series of small groups using problem-based learning methods and simulated clinical cases (paper, electronic, or video recorded) or standardized patients to introduce clinical skill or reasoning content and provide opportunity for practice and discussion (Barrows and Tamblyn 1980). More recently, web-based learning and virtual patient encounters by simulation have been introduced to supplement small group experiences (Cook et al. 2010; Kim and Kee 2012). Another common approach is âtransition to clerkshipâ courses designed as an intensive immersion experience for students just prior to beginning their first clerkship (Jacobson et al. 2010; OâBrien and Poncelet 2010). Common content areas include preparation for participation in clinical activities (including clinical reasoning), roles and expectations of students, advice from senior students, professionalism, stress management, and procedural skills. Underlying any specific model of teaching and often quite implicit is the general purpose of the preparation for clinical reasoning in practice. The six components of this purpose outlined above constitute a general framework that may be addressed in any form of preparatory education. To be able to adequately contribute to the reasoning process of clinical teams, students must be prepared with a clinical vocabulary, with the ability to create clinical problem representations, with a foundational illness script mental library, and with habits of contrastive learning, hypothesis-driven inquiry, and diagnostic verification."

3,51,0.332,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"2.4.1.1.2 How New Skills Are Generated According to Activity Theory The use of tools and strategies can help learners gain cultural knowledge, as these reflect the core assumptions and ways of knowing of the target culture. Cultural knowledge can include constraints and guidance on how to categorize and count certain things (DâAndrade, 1981; Kozulin, 1986; Luria, 1976), symbol systems that frame how one views phenomena (Bourdieu, 1982; DâAndrade, 1981), and approaches to certain tasks (DâAndrade, 1981; Luria, 1976). In this way, cultural patterns of interaction and ways of knowing are core to learning. From an activity theory perspective, the goal of instruction is to provide the tools and frameworks by which students can engage in the types of external actions that will allow them to internalize and integrate the desired content (Belland & Drake, 2013; Jonassen & Rohrer-Murphy, 1999). Such tools and frameworks may embed representations of the cultural knowledge that one wishes to instill in students. By interacting with such tools and frameworks, individuals may have the opportunity to construct the target cultural knowledge. But this does not happen instantaneously; rather, it may be necessary to engage with several problems supported by the tools and frameworks to succeed in constructing the target cultural knowledge. It is also clear from activity theory that simply providing a set of tools and frameworks is not sufficient because individuals may interact with and use such differently based on their different experiences of culture and history (Belland & Drake, 2013; Leontâev, 2009; Luria, 1976)."
303,125,0.331,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"To date, Japan has attempted to create national-level standardization so as to consolidate the quality of education. One reason for this is an awareness of âglobal competitivenessâ (Hargreaves, 1994, p. 5). Knowledge of science and technology is assumed to promote Japanâs productivity and prosperity and to stabilize its national position in international affairs. Thus, the government, especially after the Second World War, carried out a series of education reforms in order to institutionalize âscientific disciplines after Western modelsâ (Figal, 1999, p. 77). As a result, national conformity in the quality of education has made it possible for Japan to claim excellence in basic education founded on the rigid compulsory education system (see Lucien, 2001). It cannot be denied, however, that such educational conformity has generated some negative repercussions. For instance, scientific knowledge and mathematical certainty are excessively valued and actively sought in the education system, while humanistic aspects of education are undervalued, particularly in the area of the liberal arts (McCarty, 1995; cf. Toulmin, 1990). Furthermore, since the quality of teachers was for a long time left unquestioned, what the Japanese call shishitsu (i.e. the quality of teachers) has recently been called into question. This issue has become a crucial theme in todayâs educational debates in Japan (e.g. Grossman, 2004). This fact, among others, clearly indicates"
3,65,0.331,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"2.4.1.3.1 Theoretical Background The knowledge integration framework was built off of the knowledge in pieces theory (diSessa, 1988), the anchored instruction framework (The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990), situated learning in collaborative groups (Brown & Campione, 1994; Lave & Wenger, 1991), and research that suggests that learning outcomes in science instruction would be best served when one focuses on a smaller number of core concepts (Bierman, Massey, & Manduca, 2006; Eylon & Linn, 1988). These perspectives are explained in the paragraphs that follow. According to the knowledge in pieces theory, students come to school having developed intuitive theories of how physical objects behave under particular circumstances; some of these mini-theories come close to describing phenomena of interest accurately, while others are farther away from describing said phenomena accurately (diSessa, 1988; Taber, 2008). Such mini-theories are not developed as most theories areâthrough careful reflection on a variety of observations in light of other research and theories. Rather, they are âabstractions from common experiencesââsuch as the idea that force can move objects (diSessa, 1988, p. 3). These mini-theories do not together constitute a larger, more comprehensive theory. Furthermore, students do not have the right pieces of knowledge to together explain how physical objects behave in a scientifically accurate way. Some research has suggested that such incomplete mini-theories do not necessarily prompt the teaching of correct information to replace the existing mini-theories (Spada, 1994). Rather, instruction needs to help fill in the gaps in studentsâ knowledge (diSessa, 1988). In anchored instruction, studentsâ learning is centered in an authentic problem situation, which prompts students to define and pursue learning issues (Bransford,"

192,94,0.33,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"it is actually a play about science, first and foremost about astronomy (cf. Olson and Olson 1998). More precisely, the play stages a collision between scholarship and politics, as well as between the discourse of the Master and university discourse. This schema will be further elucidated with the help of a second literary case study namely Carmen, published in 1845, a novel about an archaeologist who travels to Andalusia, but deflects from his research because of an encounter with a different kind of object a (namely the gaze and voice of a living being, instead of an archaeological find: a â a), so that his scholarly research becomes transformed into an âarchaeology of the presentâ (i.e. psychoanalytical discourse). The final two literary documents to be discussed in this chapter date from the late nineteenth century and are written by two contemporaries, namely Henrik Ibsen (1828â1906) and Jules Verne (1828â1905). Henrik Ibsen is generally regarded as one of the greatest psychologists of world literature and as a precursor of psychoanalysis. His oeuvre represents a literary psychoanalytical clinic avant la lettre. Indeed, as Lacan phrases it, Freudâs oeuvre, focussing on human desire and gender relationships, emerges in âle contexte ibsÃ©nien de la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cleâ (Lacan 1986, p. 18). But Ibsenâs plays also analyse how science and technology transform the world of fin-de-siÃ¨cle culture. In other words, whereas most Ibsen scholars use his dramas to study issues in the realm of psychology and gender, I see his prose plays as literary laboratories, so that Ghosts explores end-of-life decisions and genetics (Zwart 1993), while The Wild Duck studies the emergence of photography and animal research (Zwart 2000b) and The Lady from the Sea reflects the impact of cruise steamers on art and tourism (Zwart 2015c). Enemy of the People (1882/1978), the play that will be discussed in this chapter, raises the question how researchers may safeguard their integrity while navigating a complicated societal landscape. The title already refers to the question whether scientists are benefactors or enemies of the people, or both. To explain Verneâs role in this book, some misunderstandings regarding his work must be addressed. First of all, although Jules Verne is often regarded as the âfather of science fictionâ, most of his novels (rather than anticipating the future) actually address scientific and technological developments of his own era, so that his novels contribute to a diagnostics of the present. And indeed, in his immense oeuvre (encompassing ninety novels) a panoramic encyclopaedia of research fields and research technologies is fleshed out (Zwart 2008a, p. 233 ff.). Moreover, Verne sees technologies not only as products of science (which are subsequently transferred into the societal realm), but first and foremost as enablers of research. Nemoâs submarine and the capsule that is designed to travel to the moon, to mention just two examples, are basically mobile laboratories, which allow researchers to conduct their experiments while moving towards the things themselves (Zu den Sachen selbst), allowing them to attain unprecedented proximity. In other words, what Verne reveals in his novels is the technicity of science, emphasising the crucial role of instruments and machinery. He describes how new research practices are opened up by new contrivances. Indeed, most of the machinery described in his novels is used for scientific exploration and experimentation. Also, Verne is often mistaken for an unequivocal advocate of science whereas in fact his attitude towards science"

Qualitative representations can then be iteratively improved. Modeling phenomena with mathematics includes setting up an equation that describes the phenomena. It is important to note that effective problem solvers do not solely model problems qualitatively or quantitatively; rather, they use both sorts of representation, as each informs the other and together can lead to a more effective solution and solution process (Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Van Heuvelen & Zou, 2001). For example, after creating a qualitative model, one may proceed to create a quantitative model. The finished qualitative model will influence how the quantitative model is set up. One should then see where the models are consistent, and where they contradict each other; in this way, the models can be progressively improved. By spending adequate time modeling, one can engage in more effective problem-solving, as it guides subsequent investigations, can activate solution schemas, and can provide the framework by which one can simulate what would happen when a variable is manipulated (Anzai & Yokoyama, 1984; Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Sins, Savelsbergh, & van Joolingen, 2005). Just as it is important to learn to create models, it is also important to be able to interpret the models created by others, especially in terms of what these diverse models say differently about the underlying problems (diSessa, 1988; Seufert, 2003; Wu, Krajcik, & Soloway, 2001). Doing so can lead to enhanced understanding of the problem (Seufert, 2003). This is particularly challenging for K-12 students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011; Seufert, 2003). Indeed, learners often simply adhere to the model that is closest to their own early experiences, or the simplest explanation of the underlying phenomenon, even when presented with a more accurate model (diSessa, 1988; Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). This may be explained in part by most K-12 studentsâ lack of familiarity with complex causal models, such as those that explain changes in a factor through indirect action from a combination of factors A and B (Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). While some evidence indicates that reluctance to consider an alternative model is widespread among learners of differing levels of prior knowledge and skill, other evidence indicates that it may be more prevalent among lower-achieving students (Seufert, 2003). Thus, it is especially important to endeavor to increase modeling skills from a social justice vantage point and to broaden participation in STEM (Lynch, 2001). 4.2.1.4.2.3 Argumentation Science is very much a social endeavor, as no scientist works in a vacuum (Ford, 2012). Rather, scientists work in a large community of practice in which they share and defend findings to one another, and build off of othersâ work. At the core of this is argumentation, defined as both backing claims with evidence and models, but also effectively evaluating claims on the basis of evidence and models (Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010). The argumentation process allows scientific models and theories to be iteratively improved (Ford, 2012). To be able to engage in STEM effectively as citizens, individuals also need to be able to engage in clear argumentation (Aufschnaiter et al., 2008; Jonassen, 2011; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958). For example, when scientific issues are discussed, citizens need to be able to sort out well-founded claims from"

A curriculum points to what is intended should happen in a programme of learning and the circumstances in which these activities can take place. Those activities are learning activities; and thus a curriculum is a collection of exercises and tasks, which culminate in learning of one type or another. There are three types of learning: cognitive, skillbased and dispositional, and they have different forms and operate in different ways. Cognition is the manipulation of those symbolic resources (words, numbers, pictures etc.) that points to something outside itself. Skill-based knowledge is procedural and not declarative; and dispositional knowledge refers to relatively stable habits of mind and body, sensitivities to occasion and participation repertoires. Significantly, these three types of learning are focused on knowledge-construction and are knowledge-development activities, although there are some important differences between the three types. And what can be inferred from this is that how knowledge is construed will determine how appropriate learning environments are constructed and ultimately how learners then learn in and from them. The learning aims and objectives of a curriculum do not specify how the knowledge, skills, and dispositions should be taught, though teaching and learning approaches are derived from them. As a consequence the curriculum-developer needs to reconceptualise each intended learning outcome into a programme of learning or action learning set. Pedagogic approaches and strategies range from didactic to imitative to reflective and meta-reflective action learning sets, and they have a number of common characteristics. A pedagogic approach specifies: the circumstances in which it can be used in the learning environment; the resources and technologies which allow that learning to take place; the type of relationship between teacher and learner, and learner and learner, to effect that learning; a theory of learning, or, in other words, a theory of how that construct (i.e. knowledge set, skill or disposition) can be assimilated; and a theory of transfer held by the teacher, that is, how the learning which has taken place in a particular set of circumstances (i.e. a classroom, with a set of learners, in a particular way, with a particular theory of learning underpinning it, and so forth) can transfer to other environments in other places and times. Paying due attention to these allows a proper focus on learning, with these being generally neglected in the various iterations of"

By contrast, when observing musicians in Algeria, he noticed that musicians seemed to feel music in their whole bodies, engaging more deeply with complex rhythms. Dalcroze devised a wide range of physical musical games, culminating in the educational system known as Dalcroze Eurhythmics,4 still widely influential and in use today [17]. Amongst other things, this involves students listening to music while moving arms and legs independently, to mirror movement in different simultaneous streams in the music."

This chapter is about distributions of space and time in interdisciplinary projects, and a critique of the dominant spatial logics and metaphors that often prop up interdisciplinary endeavours. Against such imaginaries, the chapter sets out four alternatives for rethinking the space of interdisciplinarity: matrices, topologies, incorporations, laboratories.

390,70,0.328,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"Prior to the 19th century, the only person to come close was Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1648â1716), who dabbled with logic early in life but then went on to other interests (such as independently inventing calculus at the same time as Isaac Newton). And then came George Boole. George Boole was born in England in 1815 into a world where the odds were certainly stacked against him. Because he was the son of a shoemaker and a former maid, Britainâs rigid class structure would normally have prevented Boole from achieving anything much different from his ancestors. But aided by an inquisitive mind and his helpful father (who had strong interests in science, mathematics, and literature), young George gave himself the type of education that was normally the privilege of upper-class boys; his studies included Latin, Greek, and mathematics. As a result of his early papers on mathematics, in 1849 Boole was appointed the first Professor of Mathematics at Queenâs College, Cork, in Ireland. Several mathematicians in the mid-1800s had been working on a mathematical definition of logic (most notably Augustus De Morgan), but it was Boole who had the real conceptual breakthrough, first in the short book The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, Being an Essay Towards a Calculus of Deductive Reasoning (1847) and then in a much longer and more ambitious text, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities (1854), more conveniently referred to as The Laws of Thought. Boole died in 1864, at the age of 49, after hurrying to class in the rain and contracting pneumonia. The title of Booleâs 1854 book suggests an ambitious motivation: Boole believed that the human brain uses logic to think, so if we were to find a way to represent logic with mathematics, we would also have a mathematical description of how the brain works. But Booleâs mathematics can be studied without necessarily buying in to his neuropsychology. Boole invented a whole different kind of algebra that was eventually called Boolean algebra to distinguish it from conventional algebra. In conventional algebra, letters are often used to stand for numbers. These are called operands, and they are combined in various ways with operators, most often + and Ã. For example:"

(p. 71). (5) Perception of the environment. Relationships between studentâs individual characteristics, such as their conceptions of learning and their perceptions of the learning environment, are represented in earlier studies (Meyer 1991) by the term âstudy orchestrationâ. Such âorchestrationâ could be either harmonious (i.e. combinations of deep approaches and positive perceptions of learning and teaching environment) or dissonant (Meyer and Vermunt 2000). For the same environment, the HY-SUP project (See. Supra) also showed the diversity of student perceptions, as well as a positive correlation between these perceptions, learning approaches and perceived effects on learning. The same goes for the work of JÃ©zÃ©gou on student perception of openness and presence characterised by these environments. As a result, the perception of the digital learning environment will be considered. In conclusion, the interactions between the variables described above have rarely been studied systematically. This is not surprising since they correspond to different research paradigms. Thus, research on self-regulated learning emphasises that the learning processes cannot be understood if they are reduced to the cognitive dimension. They have therefore sought to document the motivational aspects of learning and volitional behaviour. Despite the fact that cognitive and metacognitive strategies are constantly cited as essential for successful self-regulation, research on approaches and conceptions of learning are rarely evoked in work on self-regulation strategies (Entwistle and McCune 2013). Thereâs a need to bridge the gap between the two research traditions. The relationship between achievement goals and learning approaches has been extensively studied, however little work has been done on the impact of performance goals on volitional strategies. With the notable exception of (Pintrich 2000), the theory of achievement goals is not a major theoretical reference model for self-regulated learning (i.e. Corno, Boekaerts, Winne, Pintrich, Zimmerman). We suggest to systematically examining the interactions of these sets of variables in the context of a digital learning environment in the broad sense deï¬ned above. Finally, the evaluation methods affect the choice of learning approaches and the impact of these approaches on performance (deep strategies not necessarily leading to better performance). Taking this variable into consideration is particularly important, as forms of learning assessments often have different characteristics in distance learning and hybrid courses. For policy makers and quality management, learning assessment methods are good indicators of teaching quality."

By definition, he argued, âit excludes most depressive phenomena, even in the westâ.64 Kleinman developed these ideas over a long career as a psychiatrist and anthropologist, expounding the notion that âcultural values and social relations shape how we perceive and monitor our bodies, label and categorise bodily symptomsâ, and that we therefore âexpress our distress through bodily idioms that are both peculiar to distinctive cultural worlds and constrained by our shared human conditionâ.65 Kleinmanâs ideas were soon well-established and later expanded by a group of other anthropologists and psychiatrists interested in crosscultural psychiatry. Laurence Kirmayer, whose interest in the subject was rooted in his own familyâs experience of immigration to Canada, became another key researcher in the field.66 Kirmayer pointed out the conceptual confusion in the use of the term somatisation, setting out three distinct meanings that could be found in contemporary literature. In western biomedicine, for example, patients were expected to recognise that the roots of their distress lay in psychological or social conflict and articulate them as such to a physician. However, if somatic symptoms presented without organic cause, patients were assumed to be somatising. A second interpretation, and the one promoted by Kleinman, was that somatic symptoms present in place of an emotional problem where the body is a metaphor for social and emotional experience. Finally, psychoanalytically inflected theories of somatisation inferred that emotions could give rise to somatic signs and symptoms.67 Kirmayer pointed out that, despite the differences in these interpretations, they nonetheless all shared a common core: that âsomatisation always involves a discrepancy between where an observer believes a problem, concern or event is located, or how he expects it to be expressed, and the subjectâs experience and expression of it in the bodyâ.68 There has been criticism of the broad notion of somatisation on a number of levels. Biological psychiatry claims that the concept is relativistic: if our perception and presentation of symptoms is entirely culturally determined, there can be no âtrueâ psychiatric disorders, proving problematic for clinical practice and treatment. Some also argue that the notion of somatisation somehow buttresses a dualistic concept of medicine, which presumes the physical body is isolated from the mind, proposing instead that emotion is âembodiedâ in bodily processes.69 These matters are still widely debated and are difficult to untangle.

204,46,0.326,Iutam : a Short History,"B. Prehistory: Innsbruck Conference In April 1922, the director of the Aerodynamical Institute of the Aachen Polytechnic, Theodore von Karman, wrote to the Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita in Rome, asking for his advice and collaboration on a project he was considering. Karman noted the contrast between the rapid development taking place and the interesting new results being obtained at the time in the ï¬eld of hydro- and aeromechanics, on one hand, and on the other the little space devoted to such problems at scientiï¬c meetings, and the scarcity of personal contacts between scientists engaged in the ï¬eld. Moreover, Karman added, people interested in fluid mechanics attended either mathematical, or physical, or technical conferences thus limiting even more the possibility for closer interaction. Time was ripe, in Karmanâs judgement, to break this dependence from the mother disciplines and to give hydro- and aeromechanics the independent status they deserved. How would Levi-Civita assess the prospect of calling an informal meeting of people interested in the ï¬eld, both from the theoretical and the experimental sides? Karman suggested holding the meeting in Innsbruck in the fall and asked for the Italianâs collaboration as co-organizer. Karman had more than one reason for choosing Levi-Civita, among others, as a partner for the enterprise, apart from their good personal relations. To obtain the best result in terms of international participation, it could be a good move to have as one of the organizers, besides the Hungarian-born von Karman, a leading scientist from one of the Allied Powers, well known for his paciï¬st and internationalist views. Karman could take care of securing the attendance of German scientists and Levi-Civita could smooth hesitation and resistance that had to be expected from the side of the wartime victors, especially from the French. Also, apart from diplomatic considerations, Levi-Civita was a sound scientiï¬c choice. He was basically a pure mathematician; his association with Karman as promoter of a conference on technical matters was a living example of how Karman meant to develop the ï¬eld, maintaining close connections between technical developments and the empirical work and the more fundamental theoretical research and a high level of mathematical sophistication. Levi-Civitaâs answer was warmly enthusiastic, and he especially noted the importance of obtaining as international a participation as possible. âI thinkââhe wrote back to Karmanââthat we should send the invitation also to some English and French scientistsâ¦ Should any of them actually come, so much the better; in any case it will be clear that we are moved by a spirit of scientiï¬c internationalism.â With the material organization of the meeting in his and Levi-Civitaâs hands, Karman looked around for other renowned scientists to establish a sort of scientiï¬c committee and sign the invitation to be sent out. A draft of the invitation letter can be seen in the following. It was easy for him to secure the adhesion of his former teacher, Ludwig Prandtl from GÃ¶ttingen, but with an eye to diplomacy he felt that"

Unfortunately the variety of pedagogical responses required an increased number of teachers. The rapid increase in teacher requirement, coupled with low remuneration and state support, created a significant gap in capability. Fortunately, it seemed at the time, science had an answer. The teacher was a deep learning, online bot designed to provide the best information available. However there was no doubt of the non-natural system nor its origin. Everyone sat in front of curved screens within airy classroom. While, technically, learning could take place at home - the information was cloud based and really it was just a stack of circuits - the training systems were very expensive and clunky. No school wanted to risk de-linking the training system from the traditional training space. You could almost say that it was almost a matter of state control. That said, despite the obvious artificialness of the training artifact, the information was presented well. It took into account if you were a visual, aural or kinesthetic learner and adapted the delivery of material appropriately. Though, admittedly, there was little these systems could do for kinesthetic. The frustration however came from the requirement to learn a new training system. Fiona felt like she had used a different system every year. Sure, in the old days, the human teachers rotated like a carrousel but at least they looked the same and the teaching was the same. Why couldnât we just get more teachers?"

143,486,0.326,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"why the entrepreneurship narrative is getting such a reaction. It is the complete antithesis of the status quo. The other issue I feel we have with the education system is its outright bias toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Do not get me wrongâI think STEM is very important. But I also feel that the humanities, arts, and physical education are just as important. Again our kids have been conditioned to grow up to become doctors and engineers. In Kenya, the exit point from primary school is a nationwide examination called the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education. Millions of students appear for this exam around November, and by January, the results are out. There is generally much fanfare, and the highest-scoring students are identified, celebrated, and interviewed. And every year, without fail, these kids are asked what they want to be when they are done with education. They invariably respond with some variation on doctor, surgeon, engineer. I cannot recall ever hearing any of these kids say they want to be poets or dancers or artists. In our schools, a smart kid is one who is good at math or science; a kid who is good at drawing, curiously, is referred to as âtalented.â But not smart. For society as a whole to flourish, each of these disciplines brings something to the table. We need STEM. But we also need arts. And physical sciences. And humanities. A holistic approach to our development capacity. How will more âcuriousâ students graduate from the education system? I have always felt that the really good teachers can only be truly recognized after they have left their students to themselves. Allow me to explain what I mean by that. Given that our education system is optimized around passing exams, anyone with a good memory can cram facts and dates and regurgitate them at exam time. But knowing facts and understanding and internalizing them is a different kettle of fish. Good teachers plant a seed in your head, and usually you are blissfully unaware of it. They instil curiosity. Curiosity is what will make you go to the library and look for books on how electricity works. Not because there is an exam or because you have been asked to. You have gone on your own because you simply want to know. Things you learn out of curiosity, or genuine passion, stick in your head a lot longer than those bullet points you crammed to pass an exam and almost immediately forgot. This model of a teacher standing in front, rapping out notes, and then students regurgitating the same notes back at them during exams needs to be reviewed. I have interviewed software"
188,143,0.326,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"General Discussion: Qualitative Versus Quantitative In the foregoing sections we present an array of quantitative and qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. The selection of a particular type of method depends on individual researchersâ assumptions, values, and expertise. Some researchers defy the value of quantitative data with the argument that numbers cannot tell us anything, insisting on capturing solely qualitative data. Any method fundamentalism is wrong, not least in the light of a postulate for a wide repertoire of research skills among researchers. Still such standpoint is often found in practice, particularly by those critics instigating methodological discussions with the aim to dismantle or even discredit a particular piece of quantitative work they do not agree with. It is in our opinion, however, not that simple: Methods cannot be differentiated into good and bad, and if a particular method fails to provide results (or even more often: results beyond tautologies), then this probably says more about their competent handling, rather than their validity or reliability. Exceptions prove the rule, of course. In our view, there are two aspects to consider that influence methodological choices. First, it all depends on why the evaluation is needed, what the goal of the evaluation is, and who the recipient of the evaluation data is. For example, if the target is to feed back into psycho-pedagogical or technological development, qualitative means can provide deeper insights on what has gone wrong, what works, and what leaves room for improvement. Moreover, qualitative methods bear the potential to discover, why this is the case."

116,82,0.324,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Theories about human beings, then, can actually have an impact on the object of research. Empirical studies show that business school student do indeed tend to live and decide in accordance with the theory that human beings are self-interest maximizers (Ferraro et al., 2005; Gandal et al., 2005; Molinsky et al., 2012). The educational systems need to take this tendency seriously. Ghoshal argues convincingly that adding ethics courses to the curriculum is not sufficient, since faculty keeps the Homo economicus assumption alive in the standards courses in economics. His contribution sparked a debate about the effects of teaching and theory on business school students (Gapper, 2005; Hambrick, 2005; Kanter, 2005). Here we can add that students who learn that it is always rational to prioritize self-interest will be badly equipped to decide and act responsibly in conflict of interest situations. The behavioural psychologist Dan Ariely tells an interesting personal story about conflict of interest in a public talk on honesty (Ariely, 2012ii). When I first saw a photograph of Ariely, I though there had to be something wrong with it, since his face looked odd, with blank skin on the right side of his face, and ordinary skin with beard stubbles on the left side. It turns out that Ariely was badly burnt in an accident many years ago. His story about conflict of interest is about what happens when he goes to the hospital to see a physician who has treated him over a long time. On this visit, the physician introduced him to a fantastic new treatment that he thought would be ideal for Ariely. It consisted in using technology to tattoo artificial stubbles on the blank parts of his facial skin, making him look more symmetrical. The physician showed him pictures of two patients who have taken the treatment already, and demonstrated the likeness between the real stubbles and the artificial ones. After careful consideration, Ariely decided not to go for this treatment. His answer provoked a shocking response from the physician, who verbally attacked him and tried to instil guilt in his patient. âWhatâs wrong with you? Do you get some pleasure from being asymmetrical? Do you enjoy looking different?â Ariely could not understand the fierceness of this response. He asked a hospital deputy about it, who explained that the physician was working on an academic paper about the treatment, and desperately needed a third patient to take it in order to make the paper publishable in a prestigious journal. That was his motivation for putting pressure on his asymmetrical patient. Ariely sees this as an example of how an excellent physician and a wonderful human being can become a prisoner of his own conflict of DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0011"

In approaching risk communication and learning, we test different ways and methods from 2004 to nowadays. Here we describe two cases study we develop in the last four years in which students and experts have collaborated in preparing (1) a participated exhibition on the 2011 flood that severely hit the land of La Spezia and surrounding, and (2) a flipped-up learning tool. The participated exhibition is Piovono Idee! (Cloudy with a Chance of ideas!) and it is the result of expertsâ interaction directly in school, focus groups and hands on activities. Students involved had experience the disaster and could put their emotion into their products. Exhibits of the interactive path tell us their own history. Primary and secondary schools in areas strongly affected by the flood of the 25th October 2011âBorghetto Vara, Brugnato, Monterosso, Vernazza, Riomaggiore, Pignone, RiccÃ² del Golfo, Aulla and Ragnaia (Aulla)âand secondary schools from the city of La Spezia were directly involved in the participatory action. Planning, creation and exhibition were the three main phases of the action to improve their speciï¬c scientiï¬c knowledge with hands-on activities, while exploring feelings and emotions triggered by the experience of a flood. The learn-by playing approach is also used to instil appropriate behaviours and the awareness that every actions we take derives from a choice: we can chose whether or not be respectful towards nature. Even little actions can turn into negative or positive consequences as it is sudden evident in Piovono idee!. Indeed the learning path starts with the question: âIs nature scary?â shows a colored and smiling Nature full of gifts, which can became angry simply poking on it. The discovery of hydrogeological risk continues focusing on the importance to respect territory and on the correct land use with different totems, exhibits, experiments, scientiï¬c games. It emotionally involves the participants to favor reflective learning (Piangiamore et al. 2014, 2015). The latest activities are two role games to enforce eco-friendly behaviors for hydrological risk mitigation. A few years later, Piovono idee! was updated and the exhibition got fully portable since 2015 and ready to travel the schools of the country to involve as many citizens as possible. The second edition of Piovono idee!

In the case of the translation of statements in natural language into the standard algebraic symbolism, Radford (2002b) noticed that the ï¬rst algebraic statements are not only imbued with the meanings of colloquial language, but also colloquial language lends a speciï¬c mode of designation of objects that conflicts with the mode of designation of objects of algebraic symbolism. He discusses a mathematical activity that was based on the following short story: âKelly has 2 more candies than Manuel. JosÃ©e has 5 more candies than Manuel. All together they have 37 candies.â During the mathematical activity, in Problem 1, the students were invited to designate Manuelâs number of candies by x, to elaborate a symbolic expression for Kelly and JosÃ©e, and, then, to write and solve an equation corresponding to the short story. In Problem 2, the students were invited to designate Kellyâs number of candies by x while in Problem 3 the students were invited to designate JosÃ©eâs number of candies by x. Radford suggests that one of the difï¬culties in dealing with problems involving comparative phrases like âKelly has 2 more candies than Manuelâ is being able to derive non-comparative, assertive phrases of the type: âA (or B) has Câ. If, say, Manuel has 4 candies, the assertive phrase would take the form Â«Kelly (Subject) has (Verb) 6 (Adjective) candies (Noun)Â». In the case of algebra, the adjective is not known (one does not know how many candies A has). As a result, the adjective has to be referred to in some way. In using a letter like âxâ (or another device) a new semiotic space is opened. In this space, the story problem has to be re-told, leading to what has been usually termed (although in a rather simplistic way) the âtranslationâ of the problem into an equation. Radford suggests the term symbolic narrative, arguing that what is âtranslatedâ still tells us a story but in mathematical symbols. (Radford 2002b). He shows that some of the difï¬culties that the students have in operating with the symbols are precisely related to the requirement of producing a collapse in the original stated story. This he terms the collapse of narratives, adding The collection of similar terms means a rupture with their original meaning. All the efforts that were made at the level of the designation of objects to build the symbolic narrative have to be put into brackets. The whole symbolic narrative now has to collapse. There is no corresponding segment in the story-problem that could be correlated with the result of the collection [addition] of similar terms. (Radford 2002b, Vol. 4, p. 87)"

118,716,0.323,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"21.6 Discussing the Fukushima Daiichi Catastrophe Other chapters in this book convey the experience of planning and hosting the summer school. The week in August 2011 was eye-opening in so many ways. The students showed an unusual willingness to play along with an experiment that went against much of their previous training. Social scientists are used to deeply unresolvable problems; in fact, we often take pleasure (at least the academics among us) in societal complexity and the absence of a single right answer. Our summer school attendees remarked on their bewilderment: how to chart a course through the thicket of conflicting perspectives and options. To my mind, the most compelling parts of the summer school were not about contentâthe lectures by experts, the formulation of problems to be tackled, or even the conclusions that the student teams articulated on the last day. What was most impressive was the process, how it all unfolded. The organizers and discussion leaders managed to make space for future engineers to speak analytically and non-defensively about the failures that led into the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. It was not out of line to talk about the ânuclear villageââand also to subject that concept to some pretty stringent critique. Some students found a voice to speak from their own experience in ways that I doubt they would have tried in a regular NE classroom. Several said that whatever the caveats attached to formal projections of risk, they had never believed that an accident of this sort could actually happen. And now that it had happened, it could happen again. It also took deliberate social engineering to make room for open-ended discussions. Along with turning off the video camera (documenting for the purpose of Japanese reporting to funders) and a no-powerpoint rule for final presentations, it made a difference that we were in a setting outside the classrooms in Etcheverry, in downtown Berkeley, near several bars. It is tempting to live out of the inspiration of the summer school and to present it in the reporting language of demonstrated success. And yet I do not think of it as a straight-ahead model for future educational programs, at least not in this oneshot form. Asking the students to do little preparation, in a week of lectures and Q&A we could only get so far. When we made our way past the initial technical presentations to take up societal issues, it was not clear that social scientists were seen as having anything different to offer from engineers speaking in the same vein. And in the student discussions, inevitably, the content of âsocial scienceâ"
95,1,0.323,Elements of Robotics,"Robotics is a vibrant ï¬eld which grows in importance from year to year. It is also a subject that students enjoy at all levels from kindergarten to graduate school. The aim of learning robotics varies with the age group. For young kids, robots are an educational toy; for students in middle- and high-schools, robotics can increase the motivation of students to study STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics); at the introductory university level, students can learn how the physics, mathematics, and computer science that they study can be applied to practical engineering projects; ï¬nally, upper level undergraduate and graduate students prepare for careers in robotics. This book is aimed at the middle of the age range: students in secondary schools and in their ï¬rst years of university. We focus on robotics algorithms and their mathematical and physical principles. We go beyond trial-and-error play, but we donât expect the student to be able to design and build robots and robotic algorithms that perform tasks in the real world. The presentation of the algorithms without advanced mathematics and engineering is necessarily simpliï¬ed, but we believe that the concepts and algorithms of robotics can be learned and appreciated at this level, and can serve as a bridge to the study of robotics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. The required background is a knowledge of programming, mathematics, and physics at the level of secondary schools or the ï¬rst year of university. From mathematics: algebra, trigonometry, calculus, matrices, and probability. Appendix B provides tutorials for some of the more advanced mathematics. From physics: time, velocity, acceleration, force, and friction. Hardly a day goes by without the appearance of a new robot intended for educational purposes. Whatever the form and function of a robot, the scientiï¬c and engineering principles and algorithms remain the same. For this reason, the book is not based on any speciï¬c robot. In Chap. 1 we deï¬ne a generic robot: a small autonomous mobile robot with differential drive and sensors capable of detecting the direction and distance to an object, as well as ground sensors that can detect markings on a table or floor. This deï¬nition is sufï¬ciently general so that students should be able to implement most of algorithms on any educational robot."

They addressed two questions: What can prospective teachers learn from the analysis of videotaped lessons? How can prospective teachersâ analysis ability, and its improvement, be measured? Two groups of prospective teachers (approximately 140 in total) participated in the program. A three-step lesson analysis framework was applied to three lesson videos: (1) goal(s) and parts of the lesson; (2) student learning; and, (3) teaching alternatives. Prospective teachersâ ability to analyze lessons was measured through an open-ended pre- and post-assessment. In the assessment, prospective teachers were asked to mark and comment on events (in a lesson not included in the program) that they found interesting for: teachersâ actions/decisions; studentsâ behavior/learning; and, mathematical content. A coding system was developed based on ï¬ve criteria: elaboration, mathematics content, student learning, critical approach, and alternative strategies. The researchers found that in a relatively short period of time, prospective teachers in both Study 1 and Study 2 improved their analyses of teaching by moving from simple descriptions of what they observed to analyses focused on the effects of teacher actions on student learning as observed in the video. These data suggest promising directions for the development of both an instrument to measure lesson analysis abilities and a model for teacher learning. In addition, Stockero (2008) employed mixed methods to investigate the effects of using a coherent video-case curriculum in a university mathematics methods course to determine: (1) how the use of a video-case curriculum affects the reflective stance of PSMTs; and (2) the extent to which a reflective stance developed while reflecting on other teachersâ practice transfers to reflecting on oneâs own practice. 21 third-year PSMTs who were enrolled in a middle school (grades 6â8) mathematics methods course participated in the study. Stockero (2008) cited and Sherinsâ (2008) and Manouchehriâs (2002) studies, which focus on levels of reflection as the basis for her theoretical framework. According to Stockero (2008), a key component of the course was a ï¬eld experience with an intensive reflection component, which consisted of three visits to local middle school mathematics classrooms immediately following the completion of the video-case curriculum. The PSMTs all visited one or two classrooms at the same time; each PSMT facilitated a small group of students as they worked to solve a mathematics problem that was taken directly from the video-case materials. Stockero (2008) found that the PSMTs in the study showed changes in their level of reflection, their tendency to ground their analyses in evidence, and their focus on student thinking. She asserted that they began to analyze how teaching affects student thinking, to consider multiple interpretations of student thinking, and to develop a more tentative stance of inquiry. She also stated that the reflective stance developed via the video curriculum transferred to the PSMTsâ self-reflection in the courseâs ï¬eld experience. Alsawaie and Alghazo (2010) used an experimental design, which involved mathematics PSMTs in analyzing video-based lessons and tested the effect of this experience on the PSMTsâ ability to analyze mathematics teaching. They cited the learning to notice framework developed by van Es and Sherin (2002) and elaborated on in van Es and Sherin (2008) as their theoretical underpinning. Twenty-six"

From a knowledge integration perspective, the goal of scaffolding is to help students fill in gaps in their existing mini-theories about how nature works (Clark & Linn, 2013; Linn, 2000). As such, the promotion of productive struggle is not particularly important. But, at the same time, struggle is not something to be avoided at all costs."

118,618,0.32,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"18.3 Post-Fukushima Questions and Answers Engineers are celebrated for their role as superior problem-solvers who depend on math and science to make rational, accurate decisions, and ultimately to create new things [20]. Increasingly, scholars are raising questions that challenge the engineersâ role, including: For whom do engineers work? How do engineers select the problems to solve? Which problems are not worth engineersâ investment, and which are beyond the expertise of the engineer? Who benefits? [20, p. 26]. Since their role is traditionally in the problem-solving domain, engineers tend to stick to solvable problems, wherein a problemâs solvability is directly related to the amount of quantitative information that can be gathered about it. Trained to approach problems with the tools of optimization studies, cost-benefit analysis, and risk analysisâengineers depend on manipulating numbers to obtain objective results. One of the core issues with the problems surrounding Fukushima is that the answers rely on more than numbers. This was a concern that was raised repeatedly throughout the Summer School. Much time was devoted to searching for ways that nuclear power could be justified without weighing its costs and benefits in numerical terms. In this sense, the problems are distinctly non-engineering. And yet, they involve a technologyânuclear power plantsâthat are beyond comprehension to the majority of those outside of the nuclear engineering community. What then, is a reasonable and desirable approach to take when weighing the analyses and recommendations of nuclear engineering experts alongside the views of the rest of the population? This question, in particular, seized the Summer School participantsâ attention. Discussions about the challenges of communicating the safety of nuclear power persisted throughout the week. These discussions largely focused on public communication, safety, and trust, which were the most salient issues to the participants, perhaps because communication seems within the nuclear engineersâ realm of responsibility. In contrast, it was more difficult to have âproductiveâ discussions about issues that were more squarely located in the social sciences, including conflicts of interest, troubling institutional arrangements, and different ideas about the concepts of rationality, expertise, and risk. One of the professional norms that became evident during the Summer School was that engineers learn that it is irresponsible, and perhaps even impossible to make the ârightâ decision without adequate knowledge of the scientific facts. This prioritization of factual knowledge was evident in the organization of the summer school. For example, the first day of the program involved a series of content-heavy lectures that offered rigorous"

As part of the project, each university engages in career education, and Sugiyama Jogakuen University for its part has focused on active learning to raise its educational performance.

Indeed, the effect size estimates of scaffolding used by elementary, middle, high school, college, and graduate level learners range from 0.37 to 0.61, which is above the threshold suggested for practical significance (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2003), is substantially larger than the average effect of educational technology interventions for mathematics education ( ES = 0.16; Cheung & Slavin, 2013), and is significantly greater than zero. Furthermore, it is similar to the average effect of interventions designed to enhance critical thinking abilities among a wide range of learners ( ES = 0.341; Abrami et al., 2008), and higher than that of interventions designed to enhance critical thinking abilities among college students ( ES = 0.195; Niu, BeharHorenstein, & Garvan, 2013). In short, scaffolding led to effect sizes that were significantly greater than zero, and practically significant, among individuals at the elementary, middle, secondary, college, graduate, and adult levels. For one intervention to be so robust to differences in student populations, and to so uniformly lead to positive effects, is rare in educational research. One may ask if the scaffolding interventions in the included research were similar enough to all be called scaffolding. The lack of precision in the term scaffolding that had emerged throughout its expansion has been widely lamented (Pea, 2004; Puntambekar & HÃ¼bscher, 2005). The scaffolding definition that guided the underlying meta-analysis was Support that assists students as they generate solutions to complex and ill-structured tasks, problems, or goals, and increases and helps students integrate higher-order competencies, including problem solving skills, deep understanding of content (knowledge integration), or argumentation."

Similarly, it is not easy to find events happening in the world that could contribute to a valid learning experience. This vision of future education suggests increasing the current scope of openness, emphasizing the importance of providing open access to resources beyond content. At the same time, harnessing new (forms of) interactions may have a profound impact in education and lead to increased engagement in the learning process (Beare 2013; Beldarrain 2006). Referring to the same interaction model, engagement can arise from the person, material, or environment one interacts with and/or the interaction conduit itself. From the early Web for Schools (Van Assche 1998) project up to recent TEL projects such as the Stellar project, research has pointed to this engaging potential of ICT.4 Therefore our project explored to what extent interactions other than those found in the traditional classroom can positively affect educational attainment and enhance engagement; specifically by making information about Persons and Events available that can enhance such interactions. By doing so, we seek to facilitate the exploration of ICT enabled new scenarios, new roles and situations in the learning process."

223,298,0.318,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"How to Define and How to Obscure Knowledge One may question whether sociological or economic accounts of the knowledge society need to define knowledge. As soon as they do, however, quite different views surface. The best examples (also in the sense of solid, not simply deficient considerations) are found in the classical theories on the topic. Drucker (1969), probably the first writer to offer a conception of the knowledge society, was brief in definitional matters. Using an approach that has since become widespread (outside philosophy), he also made a specific point: âKnowledge, that is, the systematic organization of information and concepts,â¦ makes apprenticeship obsolete. Knowledge substitutes systematic learning for exposure to experienceâ (p. 268). In context, Drucker focused even more on issues of application: Knowledge is analyzed as crucial in increasing the productivity of labor. Four years later, Bell (1973) highlighted the opposite side when he noted a ânew centrality of theoretical knowledge, the primacy of theory over empiricismâ (p. 343, his italics). Accordingly, basic science is the main reference when he defines knowledge as âa set of organized statements of facts or ideas, presenting a reasoned judgment or an experimental result, which is transmitted to others through some communication medium in some systematic formâ (p. 175). This definition has remained popular in descriptions of the recent, computer-based take-off of the knowledge society (see Castells, 1996, p. 17, for example). But the focus on explicit statements cannot account for a central novelty that characterizes the work of contemporary knowledge workers or symbol analysts (Reich, 1991)âthe importance of situated problem-solving, which demands capacities of embodied or organizational knowledge. Such a capacity is probably at stake when Willke (1998) tries to define knowledge in structures where it matters ânot as truth but as a resourceâ (p. 161): âWhereas information designates systemically relevant differences, knowledge originates when such information is embedded in contexts of experienceâ (pp. 161â162, my translation).1 Unlike the standardized situations Drucker had in mind, this experience presumably affords more than textbooks can convey. Historical differences set aside, the given examples seem to offer three systematically distinguishable accounts of knowledge: 1. Knowledge as a systematic set of applicable recipes 2. Knowledge as an organized body of theoretical statements 3. Knowledge as a developed capacity of situated problem-solving These accounts do not necessarily constitute or presuppose different concepts of knowledge. Maybe they are really only about different contexts in which knowledge matters and thus give different perspectives on the same thing. But if there should"

In either form, mental manipulations of numbers are implemented based on mentally stored information about relations between numbers. The most striking ï¬ndings of the studies on oral arithmetic are that (1) this practice often emerges among groups with limited or no schooling in the context of their occupations; (2) calculation is very flexible, using different moves that are appropriate for the context; (3) oral arithmetic refers to quantities, not to written symbols; and (4) oral arithmetic is accurate in the absence of higher levels of written calculation skill (Gay and Cole 1967; Reed and Lave 1981; Moll et al. 1984; Nunes et al. 1993). Nunes et al. (1993) described the properties of operations that support oral arithmetic and the variety of procedures in detail. Oral addition and subtraction rely on the associative property of these operations; multiplication and division rely on the distributive property of multiplication with respect to addition and of division with respect to subtraction. Multiplication often uses doubling and division uses halving when these facilitate the process. All four operations often make the use of the inverse operation during calculation. We transcribe below two examples of calculation using oral arithmetic that illustrate the references to quantities rather than digits and the use of maneuvers which are not part of written arithmetic. Both children were in third grade. R: I have 243 cruzeiros (the Brazilian currency at the time) in my pocket. I want to buy this bag of marbles. You are selling the bag for 75 cruzeiros. How much money will I have left? C: You just give me the two hundred [he seems to have meant 100 or changed his mind]. Iâll give you 25 back. Plus the 43 that you have, the 143, thatâs 168 (Nunes et al. 1993, p. 41). [The decomposition of 200 into 100 + 143 is unusual in comparison to written arithmetic.] R: You have 75 marbles, to distribute fairly to ï¬ve boys. How many marbles will each one C: If you give 10 marbles to each [child], thatâs 50 [marbles]. There are 25 left over. To distribute to ï¬ve boys, 25, thatâs hard. [R: Thatâs a hard one.] Thatâs ï¬ve more each. Fifteen each (Nunes et al. 1993, p. 43).

By necessity, however, computers store discrete values. The study of discrete mathematics provides some theoretical support to the mathematics of digital computers. Another layer of complexity in floating-point arithmetic involves the calculation of fun stuff such as roots and exponents and logarithms and trigonometric functions. But all these jobs can be done with the four basic floating-point operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

25,52,0.316,Teaching and Learning About Whole Numbers in Primary School,"connection between content knowledge, on the one hand, and pedagogical content knowledge, on the other hand, and studentsâ learning, it has been found that pedagogical content knowledge is a mediator in the prediction; it explains extra variance in studentsâ achievement beyond content knowledge, whereas content knowledge does not explain variance beyond pedagogical content knowledge (Baumert et al. 2010; Hill 2010). However, these results are difï¬cult to interpret in view of the strong connection between the two. Baumert and colleagues suggest that content knowledge is necessary, but not sufï¬cient, for promoting studentsâ learning. However, it is possible to classify measures as describing content or pedagogical content knowledge. Wheeler and Feghaliâs (1983) study on teachersâ understanding of zero, for example, is classiï¬ed by the authors themselves as a study of teachersâ content knowledge, which seemed appropriate to us. Wheeler and Feghali asked prospective teachers to solve a few tasks that involved zero. Teachers had great difï¬culty in an arithmetic task that had a number different from zero as a dividend and zero as a divisor: 63 % of the participants answered incorrectly all six items of this type. When asked to explain their answers, few referred to multiplication (i.e., no number multiplied by zero can have a product different from zero), even among those who had given the correct answer. This failure to demonstrate an understanding of the inverse relation between division and multiplication clearly falls in the domain of knowledge of arithmeticâi.e., content knowledge. Division and fraction arithmetic are considered by some the most difï¬cult topics in primary school mathematics; consequently, teachersâ knowledge of division and fractions has been investigated in many studies. Tirosh and colleagues (Even and Tirosh 1995, 2002; Tirosh 2000; Tirosh et al. 1998; Tirosh and Graeber 1989, 1990; Tsamir et al. 2000) have contributed substantially to this literature, along with many others (e.g., Ball 1990; Leinhardt and Smith 1985; Post et al. 1991; Quinn et al. 2008; Simon 1993; Simon and Schifter 1991). Some of the questions used in these studies focus on teachersâ ability to solve tasksâi.e., content knowledgeâwhereas others focus on their ability to anticipate and explain studentsâ errorsâi.e., pedagogical content knowledge. To illustrate this research, we refer to Tiroshâs study (2000) of prospective teachersâ conceptions of division and fractions. Two of the arithmetic tasks presented to the teachers were: 1/4  4 and 320  1/3. The majority of participants (83 %) answered these items correctly; the errors observed were due to incorrect use of the division algorithm (e.g., 1/4  4 = 1/4  4 = 1 or 320  1/3 = 320/3 = 106.666). One of the word problems presented was: a 5 m long stick is divided into 15 equal sticks; what is the length of each stick? (In all problems, the dividend was numerically smaller than the divisor.) All but one of the teachers (96.7 %) answered the problems correctly. The majority of the teachers (90 %) correctly anticipated at least one of the common errors that children make in the arithmetic tasks and most attributed the errors to faulty recollection of the algorithms. In contrast, only four (13.3 %) anticipated that the children might swap the dividend and the divisor in the problems due to the incorrect belief that dividends must be larger than divisors. These four teachers were aware of childrenâs beliefs that multiplication makes bigger and division makes smaller and thought that these beliefs could lead to errors. The remaining teachers suggested that if the"

Educational departments (focusing on university education within their own university) have not always been well received by the âprofessionalsâ in other departments and sometimes have lacked the support of the university leadership. An obvious way for creating a culture of excellence in education is a strong education-research group, which supports the talent development of students from the perspective of the needs of graduates to function well. Such groups also can help greatly in educational innovations, such as problem-based learning or blended learning. International visibility of such groups in terms of publications in journals on learning for the needs of graduates can be helpful in establishing a reputation within their own university. An example is Maastricht University, which pioneered the problem-based approach to medical education with a strong medical education-research group headed by a professor. They also invited dialog with the medical education community through a journal on medical education. Other departments followed along the same lines. The introduction of university-education research in universities as in Maastricht is certainly not unique. Often such education-research divisions, however, languished and were abolished after a few years of existence. They were not considered by the peers in the different departments as being sufficiently relevant. The key to the importance of their role in Maastricht University seems to have been that they were both general and department specific. Every department has its own professor(s) of medicine, law, economics, and so forth, with a sufficiently conscientious staff to be involved in measurement of education outcomes and feedback on the manner in which examinations are conducted or the way in which curriculum is composed. These groups work together across departments. They are also actively involved in training educators (nowadays in the form of competency as defined by certificate levels). The context in which the university operates is an important factor in realizing excellence. It is surprising that even new or expanding universities choose to establish themselves as closed shops, even if there are opportunities to locate (for parts of the university) in a business- or industrial park. Medical departments have always been established close to and often jointly with medical (academic) hospitals. Students learn early on what it takes to be a good doctor by combining theoretical learning with learning in practice. Why is this not happening in other areas, such as engineering, the sciences, or business economics if there are private research establishments in the area? Is it fear for mixing the private with the public sector and losing the public edge in the process? Or is it the desire to maintain its own university world comfort zone, keeping at bay and defending the walls against the potentially problematic and threatening world outside?"

Still later, shortly after Hagedornâs proposal, the French mathematician Benoit Mandelbroit initiated the study of such fractal behavior as a new field of mathematics. Hagedorn had recalled a similar problem in number theory: how many ways are there of decomposing an integer into integers? This was something already addressed in 1753 by Leonhard Euler, and more than a century later by the mathematician E. SchrÃ¶der in Germany. Finally G.H. Hardy and S.

This PLE consisted of a large number of exercises, which trained different concepts in this specific domain, such as linked lists, sorting, etc. The PLE was not tightly integrated into the weekly teaching, but made accessible at the end of the semester, a few weeks before the exams. To summarize, the PLE usage serves different purposes: the students have a chance to acquire knowledge about existing tools that will be helpful even outside class. Communication in a foreign language becomes facilitated and empowered when supported by translations tools and text-to-speech. The former allow understanding and producing content that learners not yet master due to insufficient vocabulary. The later enables the students to listen to new texts, copied from any source or written by themselves. Together with a recording device, they can compare their speech to the artificially produced one. Furthermore, the PLE provides opportunities to train domain knowledge, in this case multiple-choice exercises that cover topics taught during the lecture (gender of verbs, prepositions, linked lists, sorting, etc.).

When the dummy variable contrasting whether an individual took precalculus courses was correlated with gains in probabilities at the various proficiency levels, one observes negative correlations for demonstrated proficiencies at the two lower levels (simple operations and fractions and decimals) and higher positive correlations for Levels 4â5. That is, individuals with a score of 1 on the dummy variable, indicating they took precalculus courses, are making progressively greater gains in probabilities associated with mastery of Levels 4â5. As another example of the relation between scale region and educational process, students in the academic curriculum versus the general/vocational curriculum tend to have high positive correlations with changes in proficiency probabilities marking the high end of the scale.

The sentence above was spoken after one of us (FC) had countered what she interpreted as the academicâs territorialized landscape of interdisciplinarity with a question about the untoward relationalities unfurled by postcolonial studies â as well as by other interdisciplinary theoretical domains that have been committed to queering the pitch of orthodox histories and geographies. In many ways, we understood this researcherâs response. In calling for interdisciplinarity, no one wants to be misunderstood as championing sloppiness, and few, we imagine, want to be interpellated as the inevitable jack of all trades and master of none. We certainly would not want to find ourselves endorsing, say, an analytical philosopher who planned to get by in an interdisciplinary project, untrained, as a sociologist; we do not wish to champion an anthropologist who imagines she can, in a trice, become a conceptual artist. But in this chapter we want, nonetheless, to challenge the spatial logic of fences and neighbours â and the specific forms of territory it brings into being. Here is discipline thought through the figure of the happy householder â willing to reach over the fence, for sure, but still very keen to maintain a proper sense of where the boundaries lie. Indeed, there is an important claim embedded in this metaphor (and one hears it all the time) of good fences, insofar as it dramatizes what is still sometimes an unquestioned assumption about the primacy of the private space of disciplinary training. Whatever our â and your â feelings about private property might be, it strikes us that there is a pernicious notion, embedded here, that maps intellectual inquiry on to the taken-for-granted boundaries of relationships between public and private space. (In this regard, we find it intriguing that many writings that address cross-disciplinarity employ language that conjures private property relations. We might turn, for example, to the philosopher Brian Massumi, who discusses the âpoachingâ of a scientific concept (which, moreover, on his account, does not result in âprevent[ing] it from continuing to function in its home environmentâ, and who maintains that if he âwere a concept, [he] could emigrate and stay behind in [his] home countryâ [italics in original] (Massumi 2002, 21)); or to Thomas Osborne, who describes interdisciplinary movements via languages of poaching and trespass (Osborne 2013).)

However, the most signiï¬cant work has been done in the ETL3 project (Enhancing Teaching-Learning environments led by the University of Edinburgh). This project has highlighted many âgood practicesâ in relation to teaching speciï¬c disciplines or those that are common to several disciplines (Hounsell et al. 2005).

To validly answer this question, it was ï¬rst necessary to characterize these environments based on dimensions such as: the forms of mediation and mediatisation; the articulation of the educational phases both in face-to-face and distance activities; the nature of human support; or contextual aspects such as the type of training, the number of students or educational practices (Peraya et al. 2014). Researchers in the HY-SUP project carried out research adopting a mixed-method approach in several studies (pilot study questionnaire: 174 teachers; large-scale study questionnaire: 179"

His craving is to transform it into a predictable tool, to domesticate it into a normal object, so that university discourse can function smoothly again. A working vaccine would have been a perfect outcome in this disruptive struggle for power between the researcher and his virus ($ â a). In that case, the phage would have ended his discontent, his anonymity, by making him famous, turning his life into a success story after all. But the idea of medical benefits functions as a faÃ§ade, a pretext for his urge to dominate nature in her most elementary (viral and microbial) dimensions, working himself into a state of neurasthenia â in accordance with Dostoyevskyâs insistence that intellectual activity is, in final instance, a âdiseaseâ (1864/1972, p. 18). In conclusion, we are not confronted with a moral dilemma in the sense of a problem that can be solved by developing or abiding to rules and regulations, such as the codes of conduct and ethical principles of research with human subjects. Although such practices (developed by professional ethicists) may help to subdue the tension, making microbial research more manageable no doubt, they will not abolish the basic divide. The desire to control life may become addictive precisely because it is driven by a disruptive compulsion. As a science novel, Arrowsmith opens up and dramatizes this basic rupture, thus furthering our awareness of the gap between what basic research produces and what clinical medicine basically needs. And this divide not only affects the knowledge dimension, but the normative dimension (the level of morality and of the Self) as well. According to Arrowsmith, what is considered integrity in the realm of basic research is regarded as misconduct in medical practice, and vice versa. But this may not the final word. Arrowsmith is the first real science novel, as we have seen. In the next sections we will explore how these tensions are addressed in other novels, notably in Chap. 7 (Cantorâs dilemma) and Chap. 9 (Intuition)."
360,161,0.314,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"As various writers in the past have claimed, the former is âinertâ and âis a mere congeriesâ, whereas the latter actually âdoes somethingâ in making an assertion that describes a feature of Kim. Note that a structurally identical puzzle arises if âWordâ is replaced by âConceptâ and âMy assertionâ is replaced by âMy judgmentâ. Both Objectivists and Subjectivists are subject to this puzzle, and they both should give some sort of answer. However, Subjectivists seem not to have thought of a difference between the noun-phrase conceptual combination {SANDY; SWIM } and the sentential conceptual combination {SANDY IS SWIMMING}. Nor has it seemed to occur to them that in order to give a concept-analysis of some noun phrase like a man who is tall, there needs to be a sentential analysis of the embedded relative clause (as well as an analysis of the contribution of âaâ, as mentioned above in Sect. 8.1.2). This puzzle is at least as old as Plato, and has provoked considerable discussion over the centuries. One type of answer might be to postulate a copula-like intermediary, call it âexemplificationâ, with the idea that it is this intermediary that causes the other items to merge into a full sentence. But as one can pretty easily see, this just leads to some sort of infinite regress: for, now there needs to be a further explanation of how it is that âKimâ (or the person corresponding to that name) can combine with this newly postulated object to then be able to combine with ârunsâ (or the object corresponding to that predicate). This is known as Bradleyâs Regress, or The Unity of the Proposition/Sentence problem. Objectivists have proposed various answers to the Unity problem, one of the most popular being some variant on the metaphor of saturated/unsaturated from Frege (1892a). The idea is that singular terms are such that they are designed to designate âindependentâ or âsaturatedâ objects, whereas predicate terms are designed to designate âunfilledâ or âunsaturatedâ items, namely âconceptsâ. (Recall that for Frege and the Objectivists, a concept is a non-mental, abstract entity.) When these two different kinds of entities âmeetâ, the saturated object âfills inâ the unsaturated object, producing a new, saturated objectâa complete sentence (which expresses a âthoughtâ, in Fregean terminology. . . where âthoughtâ is also understood as a non-mental, abstract item). Well, whatever one thinks of such metaphorical accounts (and something akin to this is adopted in Formal Semanticsâ model-theoretic theories), it is at least some sort of explanation, showing that there might be some wiggle room in Objectivist theories that would provide an appropriate description of what is going on. However, it seems that Subjectivist accounts are not in such a good place, at least not if they hold that lexical concepts designate mental items like concepts. For it seems that this would presume there to be a concept of INSTANTIATIONâsort of a mental version of the linguistic exemplification, and now it appears that the Bradley regress can start. Subjectivists of the sort we have been considering will respond by claiming that conceptual combination is how they handle this topic. But it should be noted that conceptual combination in these works is defined for noun-noun and adjective-noun combinations (perhaps also for adverb-verb combinations?). But this wonât work for sentence generation: perhaps the conceptual combination of DOG and"

His competitor (dâHerelle) faced a similar tension, but apparently decided to publish his findings prematurely, without sufficient evidence (controls, replications, etc.), a questionable way-out (from a normative perspective).

269,22,0.314,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"One of the founding premises of this volume is that there is no âview from nowhereâ for conceptualizing, investigating, and writing about brains, minds, bodies, and their environments. Different modes of investigation carry with them different archival legacies, and conventions of thinking and writing. As any theorist of translation, or historian of science will know all too well, there is no straightforward, translucent âlanguageâ through which any of us can present research findings, let alone arguments. As much as we want to trouble a model of disciplines in which each is confined to her own pen, let us stress that this book is written, unapologetically, by two authors who have been trained in different corners of the interpretive social sciences, and who ally themselves with social and cultural theory. Having spent significant amounts of time and resources training ourselves up in cognitive neuroscience, as well as working closely with neuroscientists, we consider ourselves to be â as social scientists go â relatively well versed in the neurosciences, and in the rhetorics through which those sciences move forward. We will do all we can to speak to, through, and with those rhetorics in what follows. Nonetheless, we do have particular networks of citations, modes of address, and means of presenting and analysing our interlocutorsâ arguments and empirical materials. This will provoke discomfort in some of our readers and friends steeped in other, scientific traditions for writing, and thinking and reading. But this, in many ways, is a volume about learning to be discomfited."

In this sense, in Japan there does exist fundamental human talent. In thinking about this background and these achievements, I am confident that Japan will not remain a âproblem-saddled advanced nation,â but rather will use its power to leap forward as a âproblem-solving advanced nationââthat is, a forerunner in addressing emerging problems in the world."

49,371,0.313,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"4 Conclusions and Future Work We have showed that the MTRNN model was able to learn eight different behavioral sequences. These constitute the motor primitive for ongoing experiments for the learning of action and language compositionality. Current developments involve the use of three additional self-organizing maps, linked to the MTRNN, and trained to represent simple linguistic inputs, as well as the object shapes and color features, obtained from images fed through logpolar transform inspired by human visual processing. This extension will facilitate our investigation of language learning. In particular, our next experiments will be addressing a specific linguistic hypothesis first proposed by the cognitive psychologist and linguist Michael Tomasello. The hypothesis, which is also known as the verb island theory, predicts that verbal argument structures are learned on a purely itemspecific basis [30]. In other words, children do not learn that adult-like verb constructions can be combined with certain types of nominals and clauses, e.g. to get a transitive directobject structure. Rather, children acquire verb concepts by developing this knowledge on an item-by-item basis where the understanding of verbs is at first limited to the context where these verbs appeared. Consequently, the general notion of transitive construction and direct object is an abstraction that occurs only during later developmental stages when a critical mass of these verb islands have been attained and thus recognized as the instances of the same general underlying (sensorimotor) structure through the process of semantic analogy [31]. During the later developmental stages children are exposed to more and more construction types where different semantic roles are linked in a similar way and as a result the involved syntactic categories will be abstracted into subjects and objects [32]. The first planned experiment will investigate the role of semantic similarities between different words during early language acquisition. In particular, the hypothesis addressed by this experiment is whether a generalization to unheard sentences is easier in condition where all learned events are of the same semantic type. Though conceptually simple, this experiment will constitute the first viable extension of the already conducted research within the iTalk Project. In addition, these problems are also discussed in child development research and therefore this work could provide useful insights."

We have decided to present our results in the form of lecture notes. There are several reasons for this choice. First, we strongly believe that the theory described above is very useful, and we want to help make it as comprehensible as possible. That is more or less impossible to do in scientific papers because their focus must be on new results and not on careful derivations of established insights. A second reason is that the problem of understanding cell physiology and how drugs affect their function is inherently multidisciplinary, and we therefore write these notes in such a way that we hope readers who are not primarily applied mathematicians can understand. We also hope to give applied mathematicians glimpses of interesting problems of great importance. As mentioned above, these notes aim to explain known theory that we think can be useful to researchers working on a mathematical understanding of living cells. There are also new results. We show in some detail how to derive formulas describing the optimal properties of theoretical drugs. Most of the results are stated for rather simple models, but it is quite clear that the methods can be extended to more intricate cases. The million dollar question when you read these notes is, of course, can these drugs actually be created? Do they exist? We do not know. We know that Markov models have been used to successfully represent the actions of drugs, but is it possible to go the other way and first compute what properties the drug should have and then create it? We have found no clear answers in the literature or through discussions with colleagues, so we decided to just formulate these ideas as precisely as possible in the hopes that someone will find them useful. We have tried to carefully underline in the notes that we are discussing theoretical drugs, and we state in many places that this work is about possible drugs."

On the other hand, history as a school subject was characterized by rote memory and copy and paste practices. Enormous list of dates, battles and main characters were the typical contents of school history in most of educational systems. for example, most high school history textbooks in the USA never had less than 500 pages, but at the same time research in text understanding was clearly showing that students had a very poor comprehension of basic history contents constituted by canonical historical narratives such as the one on the Boston Tea Party (Beck and Mckeown 1994; Barton and Levstick 1996).5 Unfortunately, even nowadays this continues to be the usual picture. Reacting to this situation and with a much more active and constructive view on learning in mind, a number of educational proposals started to be developed in the 1980s. for example, in the Uk the 13â16 History Curriculum was developed and applied in a great number of schools (Shemilt 1980). These developments were based on the importance of academic discipline for educational practice. This is to say, the goal of education rather than transmitting a considerable amount of consolidated academic knowledge was to initiate students in the practice of historiographical procedures through an emphasis on their own cognitive activity. In this respect, Collingwood (1946) was an influential author, as in Idea of History he developed his metaphor of the historian as a detective. Thus, the 13â16 History Curriculum proposed that students had to find out, for example, how and why a specific and decisive historical event had happened instead of just memorizing an enormous list of names, places and specific dates, including also specific predetermined glorious narratives. Also, from this new educational perspective, students had to contemplate the role played by some main characters. for this purpose, students had to examine and critically discuss a number of data and historical texts about that event in order to test their hypothesis. In this vein, the general idea was to base history education on thinking abilities and active knowledge and not only on just an accumulative process of storing information. At that time, the work by two celebrated psychologists, Piaget (1966) and Bruner (1966), also resonated in the field. Both authors defend a constructivist view on learning and share the idea of knowledge developing in the studentâs own cognitive activity. They were considerably successful defending the idea of the studentsâ discoveries as a sign of autonomous and active cognition. furthermore, Brunerâs idea of"

This kind of relationship could be very fruitful; often it was not, and many realized that change was needed. In the last ten or so years, however, many institutions have made signiï¬cant structural changes in the organization of their doctoral programs. Particularly, in response to funding and organizational pressure, as well as to the new criteria that appeared because of the Bologna Process, there was a widespread movement towards âdoctoral schoolsâ. What exactly was entailed in the âschoolsâ was not always clear: in theory, the school was to permit the grouping of formerly separate doctoral âprogramsâ in order to facilitate the formation of inter- and multi-disciplinary competences, as well as providing better support in terms of logistics and counselling. As to the substance of the training offered, the new doctoral âschoolsâ may not always have been able to meet the objectives posed by the new orientations and they may still not respond to present needs. The work completed in the Tuning Process has produced tools which can be of help in organizing a âlearning/researchâ environment conducive to the high level of achievement and the formation of the variety of competences expected today for those holding a third cycle degree."
346,451,0.311,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","of this work was that the use of three heuristics would significantly improve evidence evaluation on the part of the high school students. The first heuristic was defined as corroboration or the act of comparing documents with one another. The second one, sourcing, was defined as the act of looking first to the source of the document before reading the body of the text. The last heuristic is contextualization considered as the act of situating a document in a concrete temporal and spatial context. These and related ideas produced the development of educational programs like Reading like a historian (wineburg et al. 2011), which has had an enormous impact on schools in the USA and other countries.7 The approach developed by wineburg and colleagues (Nokes 2017; wineburg et al. 2010) emphasized both reading and writing as essential cognitive abilities related to the specificity of history as a discipline and tend to use the term historical thinking as the initiatives leaded by Seixas also do (see http://historicalthinking.ca/ and also https://sheg. stanford.edu/). In both cases, the emphasis has been on the cognitive activity of student as a learner of historical knowledge. This underlying idea can be also found on related efforts as the work of vanSledright (2010). But there are also interesting efforts which emphasized the idea of the student as a social learner from an interactionist point of view. In a European context, van Boxtel and van Drie (2017) have developed a fruitful instructional initiative through a dialogical framework. They consider learning as entering into a community of practice (Lave and wenger 1991) and achieving specific concepts and procedures. from this point of view, the historiansâ practice is also based on a dialogical activity. The work by van Boxtel and van Drie stems from the abovementioned contributions about fostering historical thinking and also emphasizes the use of documents and evidence. However, based on Bakhtinâs ideas (1981) about the nature and importance of dialogue, they think that historical expertise is not only based on individual cognitive operations, such as the sourcing, corroboration and documentation related to historical text inquiry. for them, it is also essential to consider dialogical activity, mostly in relation to multiple views on both historical narratives and concepts. Therefore, they confront students in the classrooms with a number of dialogical activities in which they have to compare and evaluate different views on the same historical issue. More specifically, these activities have to do with asking historical questions, connecting events, developments and actions through a historical"

Even though education is a core pillar of higher education, it would be reasonable to describe the training of prospective or current academics in assessment as spasmodic. Such development has the potential to lift practice beyond anarchy, and build appreciation of student learning and assessing outcomes. With a focus on individual or organisational rather than resource development, such training can tend to fall short of creating clearer articulation of outcome or task speciï¬cations, though it may result in diverse forms of applied work, and possibly even instil a milieu for benchmarking and other shared interpretative activities. One broad line of development has involved specifying qualiï¬cation-level outcomes. Examples include the European Qualiï¬cations Framework, the United Kingdom Subject Benchmark Statements, the Australian Qualiï¬cations Framework, and the United States Degree Qualiï¬cation Proï¬le. As the titles convey, this work is developed and owned by systems, and such initiatives have served as important policy instruments for shifting beyond an anarchic plethora of qualiï¬cations, generating conversations about ï¬nding more coherence, and indeed articulating the general outcomes graduates should expect from a qualiï¬cation (Chakroun 2010). These system-wide structures can suffer from unhelpful collisions with fruitfully divergent local practice, but their inherent constraint is that they go no further than articulating very general graduate outcomes. They offer little beyond broad guidelines for improving the assessment of student learning. Going one step further, a further line of work has sought to specify learning outcomes at the discipline level. The Tuning Process (GonzÃ¡lez and Wagenaar"

266,19,0.31,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"We use the x-axis of Fig. 1.1 to illustrate the range of analytic rigour that may be applied to the analytic reasoning process. At the start of an inquiry there is usually very little known about a case. It is therefore of little use to treat information and inferences rigorously as the analyst is still trying to understand what the data means and whether it is sensible to create an argument. The type of thinking and reasoning employed by the analyst at this stage may be characterised as being creative, having to deal with high uncertainty as there are many unknowns and missing data. The need at this stage is to gain traction and to get the investigation started. Analysts engage in the tentative and playful generation of plausible stories and hypotheses that may account for their observations. They tend not to commit to a single explanation and are likely to explore alternatives. At the high rigour end of the spectrum, the type of thinking and reasoning required may be characterised as âcritical thinkingâ, evaluative, deliberate, and final. As an investigation approaches the closing stages, most of the data required will be known. It is then possible to rigorously structure, organise, or analyse the data, and to make sure that every conceivable logical discussion can be evaluated. By this stage, analysts would have employed a variety of structured analytic techniques (see for example, Heuer and Pherson 2014) to establish strong and rigorous arguments.

Back to the stream of all possible and impossible reasons for this desire, this dream, this felicitous and infelicitous act. Realistic and unrealistic associations flowed free and forthright while the writer was sitting at the computer of course, not lying on the analystâs couch, even though Sigmund Freudâs study at Berggasse nineteen is only a stoneâs throw from here. But why should we curb our thoughts? Who could make us censor ourselves? There is no need to camouflage the paths our reflections take. Nobody is giving out grades, at least not in enlightened zones, they say. So why constrain ourselves? Why shouldnât the arts, why shouldnât artists, slip outside their time? After all, actors know all about slips, whether a banal lapsus linguae or a more dire, fatal mistake, like the bloody slip Penthesilea commits against Achilles, for which she finds only the words So it was a mistake, a kiss a bite The two should rhyme for one who truly loves With all her heart can easily mistake them [ ... ] By Artemis my tongue pronounced one word For sheer unbridled haste to say another1 Slips (of the tongue) are so common in the actorâs art â why rein in our imagination if we want to understand the autotelos of the actor? Why not continue as we started, raving about where the actor comes from and where he is going, asking all we can of this fabled creature of truth? Why not? Why not play with the truth? Why not say about the pathos of his knowledge, his nous pathetikos, that he âposses[es] his pathos knowingly, insofar as the pathos would be an apprehension of existence returning upon itself â?2 Could it be a site of remembrance, a reminder of what we, qua our existence, might have become? Why not? Does the reining discourse hold dominion over us? The old discourse? The new one? The newest?"

This relapse into hysteria, this second adolescence, may constitute an intermezzo, in preparation for a second start, as Stapel recently embarked on a new career, as an expert in derailment management (S2 resurging in the lower-right position, as a by-product of the crisis), although on closer inspection this rather seems a parody of the very concept of expertise.20 As indicated, Stapelâs biography follows a curve, beginning with a fascination for theatre, which becomes eclipsed by his conversion to scientific rationalism (social psychology, American style, grafted on a natural science methodology), so that theatre is now something to be studied rather than something to be performed (for instance: Utrecht train station as a socio-cultural âtheatreâ). But after his downfall, the theatrical dimension resurges, notably in the form of a fictitious collaborative theatre project, which apparently faltered, but which nonetheless resulted in an epistolary dialogue with co-author A.H.J. Dautzenberg, in whose work the dividing line between fact and fiction is consciously obfuscated. The extent to which the events reported in Dautzenbergâs stories are fabricated or really happened (for instance: his decision to become a voluntary, Samaritan kidney donor) remains unclear, notably because of various contradictory statements about these events made by the author himself. Their joint publication bears the title The Fiction Factory (Stapel and Dautzenberg 2014). For Stapel, this project exemplifies a relapse into the theatrical absurdism of his youth. It is a conversion into what Sloterdijk (1983) refers to as the ancient strategy of cynicism. Dautzenberg is an absurdist21 author who made his debut with a collection of short stories entitled Vogels met zwarte poten kun je niet vreten (âyou cannot stuff yourself with black-legged birdsâ). In 2011 he published a prize-winning book called Samaritan, about his decision to volunteer as a kidney donor,22 but subsequently he published a short story in which he claimed that the story about his donorship was actually fictitious. In short, the confusing fluidity of the dividing line between fact and fiction is a key motif in his writing, and the author seems to be conducting experiments by making confessions which are later revoked. Samaritan is Dautzenbergâs counterpart of Derailment, apparently a truthful autobiographical account which may nonetheless be fabricated and which functions as an experimental window into the socio-cultural theatre of the transplantation industry. Stories which may or may not be true are used as literary mousetraps to capture the latent convictions (prejudices, etc.) of the authorâs readership."

3,36,0.308,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"Also crucial to the definition of scaffolding and to the idea of transfer of responsibility was intersubjectivity, according to which students needed to recognize an appropriate solution to problems similar to the one being addressed before they would be able to perform the supported task independently (Mahardale & Lee, 2013; Mortimer & Wertsch, 2003; Wood et al., 1976). Without intersubjectivity, students are said to be unable to engage in independent performance of the target skill (See Fig. 2.2). Intersubjectivity can be achieved without knowledge of how to perform the skill that scaffolding is intended to develop (Wertsch & Kazak, 2005). It is important to note that it is not required that the understanding be exactly the same, as partners in an activity likely hold differing perspectives, which can shape an understanding of a task (Rogoff & Toma, 1997). Furthermore, if the child and adult had an entirely identical understanding of what an appropriate solution would be to a problem similar to that being addressed, then the child may not need scaffolding (Wertsch, 1984). Rather, the understanding of the task should be substantially similar between the scaffolding provider and the student. This was said to be crucial because students needed to be able to recognize when what they were doing was successful when they attempted the target tasks independently in the future (Mortimer & Wertsch, 2003; Wood et al., 1976). In short, scaffolding could help students with how to ac-"

188,173,0.308,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Learning Scenario One central aspect of PLEs is that learners can assemble their own learning environments from existing services. They decide which services to use, assembled them, and use it for learning. Such a usage presupposes active, technical-savvy students. From our experience we knew that the students at SOCE do not fall into these categories. Most students have limited knowledge about Web tools (RSS is virtually unknown), only limited time at their disposal, and limited technical expertise. Furthermore, in the Confucian culture of China learning is still very teacher-centered (Zhang 2007), and students are not used to actively contributing to class. We therefore decided to build a PLE according to the learning scenarios specified by the teachers of the courses and make the pre-build PLE accessible to the students. One example scenario devised by the teacher of the French course is as follows. His course aims at helping the students mastering the first steps in spoken and written French as well as learning about and mastering tools that help students in their working life. These two goals are supported by activities that require using the tools. For instance, starting with an English (or Chinese) sentence, such as âHello, my name is Tianxiang,â the teacher shows how to use a translation tool to get a first rough French translation, and how it can be refined by using a dictionary and spell checker. The French sentence is read aloud by a text-to-speech tool and repeated by the student until it can finally be recorded. This recorded introduction can then be uploaded to social networks. At a later point in the lecture, the students will receive a similar task, such as describing their job without being shown how to use the tools. Figure 5 contains a screenshot of a PLE, whose basic functionality is similar to the start pages Netvibes and iGoogle. It provides a single page from which the students can access different language related services and sites. The widgets of this PLE facilitate learning a foreign language. For instance, the top right widget performs spell checking; the second one below enables the translation of texts using Google Translate; the third widget accesses a text-to-speech synthesizer; and the bottom left widget allows the student to record and playback his voice."
223,51,0.307,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"The Relevance of the Spatial Dimension and the Spatial Turn From the perspective of geography-making, which begins with the premises that all socially and culturally relevant geographies are constructed realities, the spatial conditions and spatial relations of individual actions are fundamental to the formation and structuration of social realities. A prime example is the current globalization affecting various aspects of everyday life. Systematic social theories have largely ignored the spatial dimension of social life. The reasons for this omission are profound and require thorough reconstruction of the underlying modes of thought. Without such analysis, one runs the risk of importing the traditional spatial perspective into the social sciences and cultural studies. The fact that such uncritical adoption of the conventional spatial perspective is neither productive nor insightful is exemplified by the âspatial,â or âgeographical,â turn in the social sciences, cultural studies, and the humanities (see DÃ¶ring & Thielmann, 2008; Foucault, 1999; Levy, 1999; GÃ¼nzel, 2009; SchlÃ¶gel, 2002; Soja, 1989; Warf & Arias, 2008). The absence of the spatial dimension in social and cultural theorizing contrasts with the spatial obsession characteristic of early studies in human geography, a field that emerged in the late nineteenth century as a space-centered science applying to the study of human individuals and societies. This orientation and the way of thinking underlying it have significant ramifications for geography as an academic discipline and entail problematic political implications. Traditional human geographyâs rather simplistic focus on space and distance as determining dimensions of behavior results in an emphasis on the individual as part of the human species and neglects his or her capacity to perform social actions, which is fundamental for the meaningful construction of social and cultural realities. Arrival at this perspective needed a theoretical and not always successful debate lasting more than a century. The insights it has contributed greatly help the current debate about the spatial turn in the social and cultural sciences, identify its implications (some of which are problematic), and detect its shortcomings on the background of the history of geographical research. Observed from the current theoretical debates, the first turn from human geography to social geography as of the early twentieth century was theoretically uninformed about social science and showed that merely integrating the social dimension"
321,64,0.307,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"sufficient to create a vision out of 100 million fragmented pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. You have to create a vision with a flash of insight from the small number of clues that are found. A true discussion brings a flash of insight similar to that of Holmes to ordinary people like us. An unexpected idea might occur to someone when people with a sufficient accumulation of knowledge keep discussing an issue seriously. This leads to a leap to a new model. We Japanese are not good at having such a discussion. What we have to acquire is such a cultural climate for discussion. The role played by universities is important for structuring knowledge. When the student newspaper of the University of Tokyo planned to run a story titled âThe University of Tokyo 2050,â I wrote the following two things. One is that there will be a major change in the composition of students. Unlike today, one third will be students who come primarily from senior high schools. Another third will be students who return to school after having been in the workforce. Still another third will be students from abroad. Students will diversify to this extent, and faculty members will similarly diversify. The second thing I wrote is that people who conduct research deeply just as it is done today will account for half of researchers, with the remaining half represented by people who specialize in relating different parts of the whole of cutting-edge knowledge held by humanity. That is, we need more people to study structuring and integrating knowledge. It is important to âstructure knowledgeâ and use information technology (IT) effectively, in order to integrate knowledge and to create a holistic vision. IT is good at accumulating and searching information, to begin with, and this is now being networked over the Internet. Therefore, humanity will be able to solve many of the problems it confronts today if knowledge is structured, if IT is used successfully, if discussions are carried out, and if the correct knowledge is employed at the correct place at the correct time. It is precisely for this reason that âstructuring knowledgeâ is essentially important."
