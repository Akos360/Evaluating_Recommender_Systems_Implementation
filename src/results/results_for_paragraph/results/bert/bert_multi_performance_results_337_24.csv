321,75,0.591,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"Next let us consider the second paradigmââThe Limited Earth.â The problems caused by the fact that the Earth is limited are far-reaching. These include not only energy, resources, global warming, air pollution, water pollution, ground pollution, food, and water, but alsoâif we think broadlyâsuch problems as the widescale spread of infectious diseases of people and livestock. The reason is that the probability of virus mutation and transmission increases along with the probability that wild animals come into contact with livestock, livestock with other livestock, humans with livestock, and so on. And in turn, the probability of contact on the limited surface of the Earth increases in proportion to the square of the population density. âVision 2050â has been proposed as a solution to three of these issues, namely energy, resources, and global warming. These three problems are deeply interrelated, with each problem and response coupled to the others. Therefore these three issues must be solved at the same time. That solution is âVision 2050,â a model that the world should aim for in order to solve these problems confronting humanity. Of course, âVision 2050â does not include other problems facing our world, such as terrorism, political conflict, or eradication of poverty. While it does narrow down the focus to the material foundations of the overarching picture, in order to solve these three problems, it is a vision that gives structure to and integrates fragmented and scattered knowledge, thereby providing a whole picture of these issues."
218,0,0.529,Sustainable Development in The Jordan Valley : Final Report of The Regional Ngo Master Plan,"A peer-reviewed multidisciplinary Series of Reference Books and Monographs This book series includes monographs and edited volumes that cross scientiï¬c disciplines and develop common ground among scientists from the natural and social sciences, as well as from North and South, addressing common challenges and risks for humankind in the 21st century. The âhexagonâ represents six key factors contributing to global environmental changeâ three nature-induced or supply factors: soil, water and air (atmosphere and climate), and three human-induced or demand factors: population (growth), urban systems (habitat, pollution) and rural systems (agriculture, food). Throughout the history of the earth and of Homo sapiens these six factors have interacted. The supply factors have created the preconditions for life while human behavior and economic consumption patterns have also contributed to its challenges (increase in extreme weather events) and fatal outcomes for human beings and society. The series covers the complex interactions among these six factors and their often extreme and in a few cases fatal outcomes (hazards/disasters, internal displacement and migrations, crises and conflicts), as well as crucial social science concepts relevant for their analysis. Further issues related to three basic areas of research: approaches and schools of environment, security, and peace, especially in the environmental security realm and from a human security perspective, will be addressed. The goal of this book series is to contribute to a fourth phase of research on environmental security from a normative peace research and/or human security perspective. In this series, the editor welcomes books by natural and social scientists, as well as by multidisciplinary teams of authors. The material should address issues of global change (including climate change, desertiï¬cation, deforestation), and its impacts on humankind (natural hazards and disasters), on environmentally-induced migration, on crises and conflicts, as well as for cooperative strategies to cope with these challenges either locally or in the framework of international organizations and regimes. From a human-centered perspective, this book series offers a platform for scientiï¬c communities dealing with global environmental and climate change, disaster reduction, human, environmental and gender security, peace and conflict research, as well as for the humanitarian aid and the policy community in national governments and international organizations. The series editor welcomes brief concept outlines and original manuscripts as proposals. If they are considered of relevance, these proposals will be peer-reviewed by specialists in the ï¬eld from the natural and the social sciences. Inclusion in this series will also require a positive decision by the publisherâs international editorial conference. Prior to publication, the manuscripts will be assessed by the series editor and external peer reviewers."
151,11,0.529,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"The ultimate role of publishing scientific research is to enhance understanding of the environment in ways that allow the public to be better informed. The term âinformed publicâ as used by Thomas Jefferson in the age of enlightenment conveyed the thought of soundness and good judgment. In the modern sense, being âwell informedâ has the narrower meaning of having access to sufficient information. Because the public still gets most of its information on science and technology from TV news and reports, the role for scientists as interpreters and brokers of scientific information to the public will grow rather than diminish. Environmentalism is the newest global political force, resulting in the emergence of multinational consortia to control pollution and the evolution of the environmental ethic.Will the new politics of the twenty-first century involve a consortium of technologists and environmentalists, or a progressive confrontation? These matters are of genuine concern to governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. For those who make the decisions about how our planet is managed, there is an ongoing need for continual surveillance and intelligent controls to avoid endangering the environment, public health, and wildlife. Ensuring safety-in-use of the many chemicals involved in our highly industrialized culture is a dynamic challenge, for the old, established materials are continually being displaced by newly developed molecules more acceptable to federal and state regulatory agencies, public health officials, and environmentalists. Reviews publishes synoptic articles designed to treat the presence, fate, and, if possible, the safety of xenobiotics in any segment of the environment. These reviews can be either general or specific, but properly lie in the domains of analytical chemistry and its methodology, biochemistry, human and animal medicine, legislation, pharmacology, physiology, toxicology, and regulation. Certain affairs in food technology concerned specifically with pesticide and other food-additive problems may also be appropriate. Because manuscripts are published in the order in which they are received in final form, it may seem that some important aspects have been neglected at times. However, these apparent omissions are recognized, and pertinent manuscripts are likely in preparation or planned. The field is so very large and the interests in it are so varied that the editor and the editorial board earnestly solicit authors and suggestions of underrepresented topics to make this international book series yet more useful and worthwhile. Justification for the preparation of any review for this book series is that it deals with some aspect of the many real problems arising from the presence of foreign chemicals in our surroundings. Thus, manuscripts may encompass case studies from any country. Food additives, including pesticides, or their metabolites that may persist into human food and animal feeds are within this scope. Additionally, chemical contamination in any manner of air, water, soil, or plant or animal life is within these objectives and their purview."
232,370,0.526,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"dynamic adaption to our ever-changing world, whether driven by environmental, technological, societal, health, or other causes. The concept of resilience often appears provocative to the public, as it implies the possibility for more disruptions or accidents to happen. However, this is exactly what has to be realized: the fact that there is a ï¬nite probability for events with potentially disastrous consequences to happen. We need to enhance our resilience in order to be better prepared so we can minimize the physical and âmeasurableâ impact as well as the psychological and emotional health impact. Only an informed public and educated decision-makers are able to provide an effective response to a disruption. The necessity for a better-informed public on advanced technologies or more broadly for a âtechnologically literate citizenâ is not new [9]. As we can see, for example, from the events associated with Fukushima, in the discussion about vaccinations or genetically modiï¬ed organisms (GMOs) the public, particularly in the United States but also globally, is susceptible to a perceived risk, rather than a factual risk. Unfortunately, the concept of risk is not well understood in the public and therefore, any discussion about risk is dominated by the potential impact of an event, rather than both the impact and the probability of an event. As a matter of fact, the likelihood for a disastrous event to happen is often neglected. The misperception of the concept of risk in the public is compounded by the fact that the potential impact can easily be used in the media to capture attention and increase readership. In addition, social networks are becoming one of the main venues for communications and distribution of information without any review and vetting of information. The fact that social networks operate instantaneously does not help conventional media to convey information that has been vetted and therefore, is always delayed. The delayed release of vetted information by conventional means also increases the potential for early spread of misinformation, which can be difï¬cult to combat after the fact. Regarding the contentious issue of GMOs, the risk of potential side effects overwhelms the discussion about the beneï¬ts in the public. While there is no scientiï¬c evidence supporting any claims of detrimental side effects of GMOs in the modiï¬cation of approved food [10, 11], social media is dominated by claims of disastrous effects on animals and human consumers. Not only is a large portion of the animal feed in the US already genetically modiï¬ed [12] without any obvious effect, GMOs need to play a critical role in addressing the enormous and expanding malnutrition in many developing countries speciï¬cally in Africa or India [13]. The development and utilization of vaccines have prevented devastating epidemics decimating whole communities and regions in the past. While vaccination is associated with a small health risk, this risk is insigniï¬cant in comparison to the risk of foregoing vaccinations. Recent increases in measles epidemics in the US reflect the emerging challenges by experts to convince the public about the beneï¬ts vs. the risk associated with vaccination [14]. The opposition to GMOs or vaccination is largely driven by the misperception of risk, as the general public often overestimates the detrimental effects and underestimates or is not aware of the beneï¬ts and the effects of not adopting these technologies. GMOs have another challenge in that it is a new and advanced"
302,371,0.522,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"1 The Social-Ecological Risk Perspective: Addressing Global Risks A common risk definition is that âthe term âriskâ denotes the likelihood that an undesirable state of reality (adverse effects) may occur as a result of natural events or human activitiesâ [1]. A classical risk analysis calculates the possibility of an adverse event and the potential damage, for instance, an assessment of ecotoxicity of hazardous substances based on dose-response relationships. For âglobal risks,â also termed systemic risks, classical risk analysis is not so easily applicable, since the characteristics of âglobal risksâ comprise complex cause-effect linkages, which are not fully known, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in assessing the risk. For this reason, consent to risk management strategies is difficult to obtain [2, 3]. Who or what can be âat riskâ? In social-ecological risk research, risks to humans and biophysical entities (e.g., biocoenoses, ecosystems) are considered. The causes of risks mostly lie in human activities, since many natural resources and biophysical processes are influenced by societies [4]. In social-ecological risk research, it has become clear that assessment of the risk alone is not sufficient for management and policy decisions [5]. It is also important to consider the risk perception and concerns of different interest groups [6]. In the case of complex risks which are accompanied by uncertainty, it is important to define the degree of tolerability and acceptability in order to find management strategies acceptable to all interest groups [7]. Therefore, a prerequisite for risk management and related policy-making is not only scientific evidence but also an agreement of the different interest groups on how to understand, interpret, and value the evidence. Hereafter, we will outline the characteristics of global risks from a socialecological perspective and present four arguments framing microplastics as a global risk. (a) Global risks are not produced by an extreme event or a disaster but are created in modern societies as a side effect of an âeveryday modeâ of systemâs operation [8, 9] and regulation of the supply system [4]. From this understanding, we derive our first thesis, arguing that the risks of microplastics are produced as an unintended side effect of everyday operations in modern societies. (b) Global risks are complex; thus, no clear evidence of a cause-effect linkage exists or can be proven, due to âintervening variables,â âlong delay periods between cause and effect,â or âpositive and negative feedback loopsâ [10]. These and the state of ânot knowingâ [8] contribute to a high degree of uncertainty regarding effects, especially in terms of scope and time. Thus, we"
376,664,0.517,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The impacts of pathogens and parasites were historically ignored by wildlife ecologists who mostly considered disease as a compensatory form of mortality. That was probably because, with the exception of acute disease outbreaks, infectious diseases were not easily observed and those disease outbreaks that did result in large-scale die-offs were perceived as random one-time events. Only by knowing the disease status of individuals, and following them through time, do some of the underlying processes become apparent. Due to these observational challenges the importance of disease to the functioning of ecosystems was undervalued."

In the Food Security recommendations of the Rio + 20 Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Development, held as a preparatory scientiï¬c meeting to the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, one of the recommendations states that scientists need âTo understand fully how to measure, assess and reduce the impacts of production on the natural environment including climate change, recognising that different measures of impact (e.g. water, land, biodiversity, carbon and other greenhouse gases, etc.) may trade-off against each otherâ¦â. The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) is leading a consortium of international scientiï¬c unions to examine weather, climate and food security (WeatCliFS) as well as to look at the interaction of food security and geophysical phenomena. The following fundamental question underpins WeatCliFS: What technologies and methodologies are required to assess the vulnerability of people and places to hazards [such as droughts that lead to famine] â and how might these be used at a variety of spatial and temporal scales? This chapter will consider the potential effects of climate change on urban agriculture speciï¬cally and the resulting impacts on food security."
71,377,0.507,Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides: Volume 1 ISDR-ICL Sendai Partnerships 2015-2025 (Volume 1.0),"(UNISDR 2006a, b; UNEP 2012). Despite tremendous efforts and progress with EWS, the world has seen increasing economic losses and continued high tolls of death, injuries and illnesses from the impact of natural hazards such as storms in the USA, the Philippines, and Myanmar; floods in European countries, Thailand, India and Pakistan; the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola in West Africa; droughts in Africa; heat waves in Europe and Asia; tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and the Northwest Paciï¬c Ocean and disastrous earthquakes in Haiti, Ecuador and China. What has been deï¬ned as the âlast mileâ of EWS (Shah 2006)âi.e. reaching the most remote and vulnerable population with timely, meaningful, and actionable warning information and integrating a gender-sensitive and inclusive perspective into EWSâhas been difï¬cult. Most EWS focus on the hazard component of risk. But the necessity to promote an understanding of social vulnerability as a fundamental element of risk information and early warning to address the needs of the most vulnerable and account for the differential disaster impacts has been internationally recognised, and so has the need to tailor DRM strategies and practices to local capacities and needs (cf. UNISDR 2015b; Hewitt 1983). Thus, operational challenges exist for technical agencies, such as national geological, meteorological and hydrological services, to work together with DRM/civil protection agencies, statistical ofï¬ces, and other relevant stakeholders such as NGOs, to incorporate in their warning activities relevant vulnerability and impact information (including hazard and risk maps) that is requisite to forewarn, empower and guide at-risk individuals, groups and communities to assume a more proactive role in the delivery of services for DRR. Several gaps persist due to weak multi-disciplinary coordination and collaboration among the actors and agencies concerned, lack of standard operating procedures (SOP) and interoperable information systems, limited public awareness and participation in risk management, insufï¬cient political commitment, and limited public/private ï¬nancial support for the implementation of these systems (UNISDR 2006a, b; UNEP 2012; Clinton et al. 2016). Additional efforts are needed to institutionalize and strengthen MHEWS that provide multi-hazard risk communication messages tailored to the needs of speciï¬c individuals and communities, while following common standards such as the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) and colour-coded warning messages based on risk matrixes. All these factors add to the scientiï¬c and technical challenges of developing some of these systems and are critical prerequisites for their operationalization (cf. e.g. Clinton et al. 2016). Global societal changes such as rapid urbanization, increased mobility of populations and the growing exposure of people and assets to hazards are resulting in a highly"

In anticipation of these human and physical resource shortages, hospitals, public health agencies, and states have created plans to prepare for an influenza pandemic. Such plans typically include health services, public health measures, priority setting, and resource allocation and usually direct surveillance, preparedness, and response (WHO 2010). Pandemic plans typically aim to minimize serious illness and overall deaths, but more comprehensive plans also refer to special needs of vulnerable groups. The term âvulnerable,â however, often is left undefined, and, if specified (e.g., the elderly), it usually refers to increased biological or medical risk of succumbing to or transmitting pandemic influenza (Uscher-Pines et al. 2007). Few plans refer to vulnerability in social or economic terms (Uscher-Pines et al. 2007). This lack of specificity raises questions about whether (and how) special consideration ought to differ for vulnerable conditions, such as being homeless, being immunocompromised, or living in a remote community. Even when plans do mention such vulnerabilities, have decision makers or practitioners consulted the people in these categories about their needs in such situations? (Uscher-Pines et al. 2007) More importantly, has anyone reconciled the aim of minimizing sickness and death with the oft competing aim of meeting the needs of the vulnerable? Meeting the needs of the most vulnerable while being mindful of health equity and social justice has been a long-standing tradition of public health (Beauchamp 1976; Krieger and Birn 1998). In particular, public health interventions targeting the social determinants of health have been heralded as an effective way to combat systemic inequities that lead to disparities in health outcomes (Wilson 2009). However, some challenge the notion of vulnerability as a static condition that can be predefined. Broadly defined categories of vulnerability can exclude people not traditionally seen as vulnerable (such as health care workers), while including people thought to be vulnerable who, with the right supports, can actually participate in the emergency response (e.g., retired older adults) (Mastroianni 2009). Considering and doing something about the context-specific needs of those who might be most vulnerable during a pandemic, can easily become a complex, ethically fraught task. A further complication is that the interventions taken in response to a pandemic can unintentionally render some people more vulnerable (Mastroianni 2009). Most pandemic influenza plans, for example, seem to focus on hospitals, directing attention to managing intensive care unit (ICU) bed and equipment shortages and distributing resources in high-acuity settings. Such plans often call for redeploying workers from community settings to hospital settings. Because many of these workers already work part-time in the community and hospital sectors, this option is appealing. But if workers are shifted from community health care settings to hospitals, people in the community who depend on these workers may become vulnerable from the intervention."

169,21,0.491,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(AM), which offers a framework to integrate the knowledge, methods, and operations of the research, policy, and local practice communities. It has been developed over four decades of experimental applications to understand and manage crises of collapsed ï¬sheries, agriculture, forestry, and rangeland grazing (Holling 1978; Walters 1986; Gunderson et al. 1995). In addition to incorporating multiple perspectives, AM increases adaptive capacity by shifting decision-making processes from linear (crisisâanalysisâ policy) to a cyclic process (Fig. 1.3). This process structures learning and iteratively integrates how we modify assessment and policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring in order to track and manage change in the world (Magnuszewski et al. 2005). The search for durable solutions to crises in ecosystems and society has repeatedly expanded the scope of inquiry outward from science to develop policies based on a broader base of experience and practice. Initial experiments (Holling 1978) acknowledged government and local practice but focused mostly on bridging disciplines within science. Subsequent experiments worked to include government (Walters 1986), local practitioners (Light and Blann 2000). However, managing aquatic ecosystems proceeds over time scales (decades) that far exceed those of individual projects or individual management campaigns. To make ecosystems sustainable, the adaptive potential raised by AM must be sustained over periods long enough to institutionalize adaptive and sustainable practices. This drive to build long-term ecosystem sustainability proposed adaptive governance as a framework that would foster AM while addressing social aspects neglected in initial AM experiments (Gunderson et al. 2016). Speciï¬cally, it should create a workspace where formal and informal institutions can collaborate to understand and manage complex issues in social-ecological systems (Schultz et al. 2015). Adaptive governance would be distinguished by its capacity to increase the importance of learning and to bridge previously separate levels: formal/informal, scales of administration (polycentricity), in ways that embrace cross-scale interactions in ecosystems and society (Chafï¬n et al. 2014; Chafï¬n and Gunderson 2015)."

55,173,0.489,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"But what can a study of these diseases at the margin contribute to our understanding of the middle, the majority and the mainstream? Above all, our analysis reminds historians that the minor, self-limiting and self-treated conditions are common across medicine and not just with infectious diseases. Illness âice bergsâ, the many episodes that do not reach the medical gaze, were and are present across all areas and most diseases. Yet, gaze of historians has always tended to be âabove the waterâ. For example, histories of the âGreat Influenza Pandemicâ of 1918â1919 emphasise that between 20 and 40 million people died of the infection or complications such as pneumonia, yet the average mortality rate was around 2% (varying between 1% and 10%) amongst those who suffered.5 This rate was very high compared to the normal experience of influenza, where case fatality rates was and remains typically less than 1%.6 Both figures make our point that the majority patient experience of influenza was and is one of recovery; with an illness of variable severity, which was and is typically self-treated and not require medical attention, if indeed, the sufferer had access to, or could afford, professional consultation. Moreover, then, as now, those likely to die of pneumonia were and are people with underlying health problems; in other words, those with weakened âsoilâ. The investigation of rare and unusual diseases highlights the importance of the adaptation of mainstream ideas and practices to novel problems, and the opportunities to âexperimentâ with new methods of diagnosis and treatment. In an era when standardisation and formal protocols dominate medical practice, our study of âorphan mycosesâ has shown the variability, complexity and individuality of clinical practice and the many resources, theoretical, practical and material, that doctors drew upon, and still draw upon, in all aspects of clinical work. The ways in which uses of amphotericin B, one the earliest antifungal antibiotic drugs, has been reinvented many times exemplifies this adaptability and shows the need to think about invention and innovation as processes rather than events. The very recognition of âorphan diseasesâ in part derives from novel medical and social technologies of surveillance, which have provided new types of recognition of infection, such as X-rays and immune reactions, and new attitudes to risk associated with social, economic and technological changes, such as the negotiation of thresholds for intervention in public health and with specific populations. Marginality has been studied by historians and sociologists of science as a âcontextâ that stimulates innovation.7 These ideas have been critiqued empirically and for having loose definitions of marginality"

The PAR Model explains disasters as the âintersection of the natural hazard and the processes that generate vulnerabilityâ (Wisner and Blaikie 2004; Blaikie and Brookfield 1987; Birkmann 2006). These processes, explained in part by political ecology, are categorized as root causes, dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions, as shown in Fig. 11.2, and are based on physical, political, economic and social environments and variables. For this research, the analysis included the role of DRE systems in improving the dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions that decrease vulnerability as well as how DRE systems can be more robust in order to decrease t impact of the hazards on them, and reducing the overall risk of the disaster."

Previously, the animals affected had been regarded as costly impediments to agricultural production, and as transmitters of infections to humans. However, their promotion as food sources for hungry humans led to the realization that, in addition, these animals produced less food for humans, thereby posing dual threats to human health. This was highlighted by one of the Committeeâs leading experts, the Swiss-American veterinary scientist Karl Meyer, in a technical paper on âThe Zoonoses in Their Relation to Rural Healthâ that he presented, on Kaplanâs invitation, to the Seventh World Health Assembly: One need only to consider all of the adverse effects of the zoonoses to realize the urgency of control: loss of life, acute and chronic illness of inhabitants of rural areas, loss of life and impairment of productivity of farm animals with all of the social and economic implications, and loss of life and acute and chronic illness of city dwellers to whom the zoonoses may spread â¦ These infections unquestionably have far-reaching economic aspects; they may mean mere loss of profit or they may mean critical want. In some areas they preclude the raising of livestock altogether â¦ in others they make an already poverty-stricken group poorer still and deny food supply to undernourished populations. In their destruction of food supply alone they are major economic problems. Some of the diseases â¦ are detrimental to rural populations because of their direct effects on health of farm people, making habitation in rural areas impossible or hazardous; some are more important in their effect on the worldâs food supply.131"

118,663,0.48,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"20.3 Communication on Science and Technology The importance of social aspects in the development and utilization of science and technology has been increasingly recognized not only in the nuclear engineering field but also in other science and engineering fields. The cause for this realization is the increase of social conflicts related to science and technology, such as environmental problems, ethical concerns in frontier engineering (e.g. genetics), etc. [4]. In this context, two cases immediately draw our attention [4]: the study by Wynne [5] on how the general public understands and deals with scientific knowledge about environmental contamination in the vicinity of the Sellafield-Windscale site in U.K., and the circumstances of U.K.âs government response to the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) issue [6]. It is explained, for example, that the âdeficiency model,â which considers that miscommunication and misunderstanding on science and technology mainly rest on the deficiency of the citizenâs knowledge, is not plausible in many cases [5]. Then, not only the importance of the trust in information of science and technology but also the importance of the trustworthiness of an organization which deals with the information are claimed [4]. One of the effective ways to foster the trust and the trustworthiness is mutual communication between citizens and experts, not oneway communication from experts to citizens, such as teaching and enlightening. The mutual communication may include the reflection of public opinion in the development and the utilization of science and technology, public involvement in the decision making process for science and technology issues, etc."

97,418,0.477,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Climate change and related hazards are an increasing threat to urban development, which, in turn, is increasing vulnerability to these hazards by inconsiderate development choices (OECD 2009; UNISDR 2008). This trend is expected to continue. Climate change is projected to magnify the frequency and intensity of weatherrelated hazards, which already account for the majority of annual losses from disasters (IPCC 2012, 2014; UNISDR 2010). Consequently, resilience has emerged as a central concept in international and national development policy together with the concept of mainstreaming (Pervin et al. 2013; Wilkinson et al. 2014). Today, increasing resilience through the mainstreaming (or integration) of climate risk considerations into sector work is a unifying goal for the domains of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (Andrade et al. 2011; Wamsler 2014). Resilience, i.e., â[T]the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from their effects (â¦)â (UNISDR 2009, 2015), is also a feature of related global agendas, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015â 2030, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement."

However, there are also many indirect damages that are difï¬cult to quantify because they would require a deeper understanding of the ecosystem-economy relationship (Bradshaw et al. 2016). Furthermore, many invasive species are also vectors of human diseases, such as malaria, plague, typhus or yellow fever, and their transportation may result in outbreaks of these infections in previously unsuspected areas (Lounibos 2010; Capinha et al. 2014). Also, invasive species may cause ecological or landscape changes that have negative implications for human safety, these can assume multiple forms, such as the promotion of pathogen eruptions (Vanderploeg et al. 2001), or an increase in the vulnerability of landscapes to natural hazards such as ï¬res (Berry et al. 2011). Importantly, many of the future impacts of non-native species may still remain unknown. For instance, the increased profusion of invasive species may render a cascading effect on the vulnerability of ecosystems, i.e. by making these even more susceptible to future impacts. Climate change is a further source of concern. Changes in climatic patterns altering the geography of the areas that can be invaded may put additional pressures on native biodiversity. Understanding how these processes will interact in the future to determine the impacts of biological invasions is challenging. In fact, many future invasions may have already been set in motion, i.e. many non-native species are currently in a lag-phase, i.e. with little or no increase in species occurrence, to be followed by an increase-phase in which species occurrence and invasiveness rises rapidly before becoming invaders (Aikio et al. 2010; Essl et al. 2011). Without increased efforts to manage non-native species in transportation infrastructures, including in vehicles, transported cargo and verges, the number of invasive species will likely continue to grow steadily (Keller et al. 2011). Hence, more effective policies to reduce the transport and release of non-native species, and to manage those already established, should become a priority (Pimentel et al. 2005; Keller et al. 2011)."

302,386,0.468,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"to which a problem or a risk can be structured depends on consensus, values, views, and secured evidence, which includes knowledge of causes and effects. The continuum ranges from structured problems with common values and consensus on strategies and on the evidence, which comprises secured knowledge including clear causes and effects, to unstructured problems with competing values and no consensus on strategies and on the scientific evidence due to ambiguity and uncertainty [58]. In the case of the adoption of the Microbead-Free Waters Act, different actors were involved in âstructuring the problemâ [58]. Scientific evidence on the pathways into and the abundance in the environment was provided in strong collaboration with activists. For example, the NGO 5 Gyres Institute published the first microplastic pollution survey of the Great Lakes region in collaboration with the State University of New York in 2013. The concentration of microplastics found in the Great Lakes was higher than that of most samples collected in the oceans [59]. The studies were covered by the media, and the argumentation chain presented was quite clear: the microbeads threaten our lakes and rivers, stem from our cosmetic products, and slip through the sewage plants [60â62]. A clear scientific narrative was established and presented by scientists and activists to big personal care companies. The short âviewpointâ paper by Rochman et al. titled âScientific Evidence Supports a Ban on Microbeadsâ [63], comprising a simple calculation of the number of microbeads and their route into the environment, was clearly aimed at strengthening this scientific narrative. At the same time, environmental and ocean-protection NGOs campaigned for a ban on microplastics in cosmetics. Their campaigning methods included shopping guides that listed all producers using microplastics in their products and the app âBeat the Microbeadâ which could be used to check whether a product contains plastics. This app was launched by two Dutch NGOs in 2012 and further developed for international use by UNEP and another environmental NGO in 2013 [64]. With the guide and the app, tools were provided which enabled consumers to reduce their use of cosmetic products containing microplastics and to become more aware of the issue. In the cosmetics industry, the evidence presented by the coalition between scientists and activists was not seriously contested. Global players like Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, and other multinationals announced that their products would be plastic-free within the next few years and that they would use natural substitutes instead. Since then, many more companies have pledged to phase out microplastics, motivated by reputational or environmental concerns. With the detection of high amounts of microplastics in the Great Lakes, on the doorstep of the USA, the campaign against microplastics was boosted and entered the governmental arena, with several US states passing laws banning microbeads in cosmetics in 2014 and 2015 (e.g., New York, Illinois, California). In March 2015, legislation to ban microplastics in cosmetics was introduced in the US Congress. How well the problem was structured by then is reflected in the speed with which the bill was passed: In March, it was introduced in the House of Representatives; in December, it was reported on and amended by the Committee"
97,110,0.467,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","There is still considerable need for fundamental research on the ecological characteristics that could mitigate the effects of extreme events and climate change. Sound ecological knowledge is the first building block for understanding how to design NBS to meet different needs. These needs can be understood as the âdemandâ for protection, and are very much determined by socioeconomic factors and cannot be captured by a biophysical assessment alone. An ecologically suitable NBS will only deliver expected solutions if it is sufficiently sized and adequately located (cf. Andersson et al. 2015). The answers to both these questions need to be sought in the larger social-ecological system â as is clearly demonstrated by the literature on vulnerability and exposure (e.g. Adger et al. 2005; Folke 2006). According to IPCC âvulnerability describes a set of conditions of people that derive from the historical and prevailing cultural, social, environmental, political, and economic contextsâ and âthe propensity of exposed elements such as human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard eventsâ (IPCC 2012, p. 71 and p. 69, respectively), while exposure refers to an âinventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occurâ (ibid., p. 69). While the literature and common usage sometimes conflate the two they do capture different aspects. To be vulnerable you must be exposed to the risk, but exposure alone is not sufficient. Awareness of exposure together with appropriately planned and implemented adaptation measures may at least reduce the vulnerability of people and property. If NBS are to contribute to making communities less vulnerable they must be sized to match the magnitude of the disturbance and the extent of the exposed area. For example, bioswales and other types of green infrastructure being employed around the world in cities to provide NBS for mitigating surface flooding may fail if overwhelmed by large or extreme precipitation or flood events. Second, they need to be located in the right place. There are several possible spatial relationships between the source of the insurance capacity â the NBS â and where people and property may benefit from it (see e.g. Fisher et al. 2009; Renaud et al. 2016). Most usually, the insurance is achieved by the NBS providing a âbufferâ between the exposed area and the potential risk, e.g. wetlands upstream or along the coast outside a city (see Haase 2017, Chap. 7, this volume). This connection between the NBS and their beneficiaries is mediated by social structures such as built infrastructure"
347,278,0.466,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The five cases of environmental governance studied in this project have been identified as key large-scale environmental problems and risks in the Baltic Sea (see Gilek et al. 2016; HELCOM 2010): fisheries, eutrophication, invasive alien species, chemical pollution and oil discharges linked to marine transportation. However, as revealed throughout the previous chapters, they differ substantially in terms of the complexity of risk sources, the available knowledge and the uncertainties connected to assessing environmental effects for advising decision-making, as well as with respect to the degrees of ambiguity and sociopolitical controversy involved in policy and management (Gilek et al. 2011). In this chapter, we investigate the interactions between risk assessment (science) and risk management (policy) in the five different cases. We analyse and compare these interactions using a theoretical framework on science-policy interfaces described in Sect. 8.2. Specifically, we study how organisational structures and processes of science-policy interactions adapt to key challenges of science and management in environmental governance by focusing on different forms of uncertainty, as well as on stakeholder conflicts and disagreements involved in science and/versus policy in the five cases. We also trace the respective management reactions to these challenges in each of the cases using a typology of different kinds of incomplete knowledge and their consequences for management responses as described below (Sect. 8.2.2). Through this comparative study of science-policy interfaces across the five cases, we point out institutional and procedural hindrances, challenges and prospects for improving science-policy interactions for a more effective and sustainable environmental governance of the Baltic Sea. Following the discussion on our theoretical framework, we present the results of our analysis of the five science-policy interfaces (Sect. 8.3). The two sections thereafter discuss the outcomes of the study (Sect. 8.4) and provide conclusions and recommendations (Sect. 8.5), respectively."

97,168,0.464,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Cities, if exposed to hazards, are hotspots of vulnerability due to the concentration of people and infrastructures. It is increasingly acknowledged that the human vulnerability to natural hazards is the result of the socio-economic, physical and environmental processes that characterise a social-ecological system and is thus socially constructed (Oliver-Smith 1999). This view of hazards is even more relevant in urban areas where the environment is highly modified by physical infrastructures and socio-economic activities. Cities are centres of interchange of knowledge, cultures, innovations and goods. To facilitate exchanges, these are often located in the proximity of rivers and seas making them exposed to a number of hazards such as storms, flooding, cyclones, coastal erosion and sea level rise (Sherbinin et al. 2007). Urban sprawl can exacerbate impacts of hazards through âpoor urban management, inadequate planning, high population density, inappropriate construction, ecological imbalances and infrastructure dependencyâ (Jacobs 2005). As a result, cities of developed countries may face the highest impacts in terms damages assets and economic losses (Dickson et al. 2012). In the US, catastrophic events have increased in the last 35 years according to MunichRe NatCatService.1 In healthy environments, ecosystems do not strictly experience disaster in the same way that we consider disaster in the human context. When discussing risks to ecosystems, ecologists tend to discuss this in terms of disturbance (e.g. Attiwill 1994; Swetnam and Betancourt 2010). In fact, variation and extremes in weather and climate and other disturbances have always been part of the functioning of natural ecosystems and provide a wide range of benefits such as soil fertilization in floodplains in the case of floods or groundwater recharge in the case of intense precipitation events associated, for instance, with typhoons. However, major impacts on the ecosystem might occur if hazards affect a degraded and less diverse ecosystems, as is often the case in and around cities (Alberti 2005). This could translate to a temporary or even permanent decline or impairment in supplying necessary ecosystem services to urban and peri-urban areas. Mitigating and adapting to climate change in and around cities thus needs to take into account the interacting effects of the built infrastructure and climate change on the ecological or biophysical components of local and regional ecosystems. If we are to utilize nature-based solutions (NBS) for CCA and DRR, then the health and function of urban ecosystems is of primary importance for providing effective climate regulating services. https://www.munichre.com/en/reinsurance/business/non-life/natcatservice/index.html (Retrieved on 13th of October 2016)."

383,467,0.462,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"There are various stakeholders in risk communication, each having different responsibilities and interests. Each risk situation involves several or many stakeholders, where some are decision-makers, and some are affected. In the Covid-19 pandemic, everyone was a stakeholder, from governments, doctors, nurses, cleaners, and researchers to public individuals. In what follows, we briefly list the types of stakeholders. Government agencies include public health departments, environmental protection agencies, and regulatory bodies. They are responsible for assessing and managing risks, providing accurate information to the public, and coordinating emergency response efforts. An example was Covid-19 and health departments and government representatives needing to decide what action to take concerning the lockdown and what to say to the public. Scientific and technical experts and subject matter (e.g., experts in virology). They analyse data, conduct risk assessments, and provide evidencebased information to inform risk communication strategies. These experts often collaborate with government agencies, industry representatives, and other stakeholders to ensure accurate and up-to-date information is conveyed to the public. Industry and business entities that produce or handle potentially risky products (such as toxic waste) or processes (such as AI-related risks where AI wrongly classify a person as healthy) have a responsibility to communicate the associated risks. They collaborate with government agencies to adhere to regulations, provide necessary warnings or precautions, and ensure the safety of their products or services. Industry stakeholders also play a role in crisis communication during incidents or accidents related to their operations. Industry and business entities also want to ensure that their businesses are profitable and not victims of risks too caused by, e.g. digital attacks, the"
376,840,0.459,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Rangeland systems have coped or adapted to a wide range of past extreme events, lowering the risk of these events in the future. Risk is quantified as the product of the probability of occurrence of hazardous events and the impact of these events. Climate change could increase the risk of loss of rangeland ecosystem functions such as regeneration and recovery, soil development, and nutrient cycling, and the risk of loss of biodiversity including domestic as well as native plants and animal species. Climate change, coincident with resource management, could increase the risk of degradation or desertification. Future extreme weather events could enhance the risk of loss of infrastructure (buildings, fences, equipment, water systems), enterprise assets (livestock including genetic stock, resource productivity through soil erosion and degradation), and social networks (transportation, informational, and financial). While many risks can be identified, the challenge is to identify those risks that are most important to the sustainability of the socio-ecological system in the future. Key risks to rangelands are those that portend potentially adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability of societies and systems exposed. Identifying these types of climate-related risks involves framing the risk as resulting from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard (Fig. 15.4). Risks in this climate-related context are considered âkeyâ due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. In this framework, emergent risks, not previously considered, can arise from indirect impacts of climate change. For example, encouraging the production of bioenergy crops may decrease food security by reducing the land area producing food crops. The following are identified as key risks (Oppenheimer et al. 2014): risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings; risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semiarid regions; and risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for human livelihoods. Risk perception influences human behavior. Risk perception of owners and managers of rangeland systems builds from past management of drought, wildfire, and extreme heat; however, social considerations, rather than physical vulnerability to climate change (e.g., availability of water), are known to determine managersâ perception of the risk of climate change (Marx et al. 2007; Moser and Ekstrom 2010;"

Whilst some scholars have contested the reliability of public knowledge in ensuring effective public awareness, lay epidemiology becomes a new discourse in exposing conceptions (and misconceptions) about health and disease and provides clues as to what kind of public health intervention is necessary (Laverack 2009). This is made possible by the prevailing use of social media of Twitter, Facebook and other social blogs which has fostered a new socio-political culture of sharing. Another key opportunity is the use of social media in enhancing community preparedness for health disasters. In the ï¬rst place, the use of geographic information system (GIS) becomes more prevalent in constructing necessary knowledge for emergency medicine. The Ready New York initiative was developed by the New York City Government in allowing residences to develop their own plans of evacuation in cases of natural or human-made disasters (Zarcadoolas and Pleasant 2009). Cromley and McLafferty (2012) point to the geospatial mode of health communication which can allow health authorities, community leaders and residents to identify the possible âhotspotsâ for critical intervention. For example, the US Department of Homeland Securityâs Science & Technology Directorate, capitalising upon the proliferation of smartphones and other GPS technologies, has introduced the Social Media Alert and Response to Threats to Citizens (SMART-C) programme. The programme, accordingly, âaims to develop citizensâ participatory sensing capabilities for decision support throughout the disaster life cycle via a multitude of devices (such as smartphones) and modalities (MMS messages, Web portals, blogs, tweets, and so on)â (Adam et al. 2012, p. 92). At the same time, the use of online virtual gaming is popularising emergency health knowledge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently made use of Zombie Preparedness to create a virtual community for engaging public in developing emergency preparedness (CDC 2015). The third opportunity is the usage of new media in different health campaigns can equip community members for enhancing linguistic and knowledge capacities. Although the traditional printed media has a relatively long history in contributing to the success of many health campaigns, the new media provides a more dynamic and robust way of engaging a wider scope of audience. Yan Tianâs study on the impact of Web 2.0 arrives at the conclusion that the media has a positive impact on the audienceâs understanding about issues related to organ donation (Tian 2010). Donorsâ families, recipients and activists are able to make use of the digital media platform such as YouTube for disseminating the medical knowledge and beneï¬ts of organ donation (ibid). Meanwhile, new media has been argued to have played a crucial role in the promotion of sexual health (Guse et al. 2012). The ability to identify the health risks associated with unsafe sexual practices has accordingly been enhanced with the digitalisation of health communication (ibid). On the whole, all these three opportunities have pointed to the fact that the role of the new media in promoting public health goes beyond passive acquisition of health-related information; instead, it points to the possibility for a decentred, non-hegemonic way of disseminating and expanding the existing body of health knowledge."

Nature-based solutions as social-spatial interventions have a transformative impact in the relations between people and nature. First, nature-based solutions contribute in the mental and physical health and wellbeing of people in cities (Andersson et al. 2015; Ambrey and Fleming 2014, p. 1298; Bratman et al. 2015; Buchel and Frantzeskaki 2015; Carrus et al. 2015). Reconnecting with nature in cities can contribute to social ties, establishment of sense of community and social cohesion (Kazmierczak 2013). Second, nature-based solutions are systemic ways on locally responding to climate change pressures. So far research has focused on the (potential) insurance value of naturebased solutions that revolves around the restorative capacity of these solutions deeming them effective for climate change adaptation and mitigation (Green et al. 2016; Haase et al. 2012; Kabisch et al. 2016; Mullaney et al. 2015; Andersson et al. Chap. 4 this volume). We add to this understanding is that nature-based solutions can have regenerative impact (Carrus et al. 2015, p. 226). We argue that for understanding the impact of nature-based solutions in cities, we need to attend to their social production (Ernston 2013). In this way, we will understand how nature-based solutions as social-spatial settings, they mediate the need and ability of actors and communities to establish a positive dependence of place motivating them to restore it (Tidball and Stedman 2012, p. 297). Third, transition initiatives are instrumental in creating and localizing nature-based solutions, moving from a passive experience âof natureâ to an active experience âwith (making) natureâ. In this way, transition initiatives experiment with nature-based solutions, learn-by-doing on how to adapt them to city-specific and place-specific situations and geophysical characteristics and create new narratives and understandings of their benefits. As thus, nature-based solutions are seeds of transformation of local practice and local space towards more sustainable ones. In line with the above, nature-based solutions as social-ecological settings require social actors and social processes to be implemented in cities. In this chapter we examine the way nature-based solutions scale as a social process that includes transition initiatives driving their social production. Specifically, we examine, how transition initiatives as actor configurations that establish, experiment and localise nature-based solutions shift them from âsolutionsâ to social configurations, making nature-based solutions the new âurban commons of sustainabilityâ and in this way contributing to accelerating sustainability transitions in cities."

347,33,0.455,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The interactions between the primarily science-based assessment sphere (i.e. generation of knowledge on environmental status, pressures, risks and problems) and the management sphere (i.e. decisions on and implementation of actions) have been described as key processes in environmental governance (Renn et al. 2011; Rice 2005). Science has since long been seen as the primary provider of knowledge and advice to guide environmental policy-making, especially in the case of managing environmental risks stemming from industrial technologies and pollutants (Karlsson et al. 2011). This has also been the case in the Baltic Sea region, both nationally and in relation to the activities of international organisations such as HELCOM and ICES (Udovyk and Gilek 2013). However, interactions over science-policy interfaces (e.g. connected with the evaluation of what constitutes good environmental status and unacceptable levels of risk) are usually complicated by severe challenges connected with complexity, ignorance, uncertainty and ambiguity (Renn 2008; Stirling 2007), which frequently result in controversy in both society and science on appropriate risk assessment and management. It has been argued that scientific uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements and conflicts are particularly problematic for marine environmental governance when implementing holistic management approaches such as EAM and MSP (Linke et al. 2014; Rice 2005; Wilson 2009). Observations of impaired public trust in science and recognition of other legitimate knowledge providers, such as practitioners, stakeholders and experts based elsewhere than in traditional research organisations, have also been linked to cases of severe scientific uncertainty (Irwin and Michael 2003), in combination with a common politicisation of science (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2010; Weingart 1999). In response, Stirling (2007)2 has argued that different types of environmental issues characterised by uncertainty and ambiguity require an expansion of traditional strategies in science and policy, to include precautionary and participative approaches. As a consequence, the relationship between science and policy is changing on both a theoretical and practical level, particularly with regard to complex environmental issues such as marine governance. It is, however, despite a long and Stirling (2007) differentiates between four types of scientific incertitude: risk (quantitative data and knowledge exist), uncertainty (qualitative understanding of outcome, but not probabilities), ambiguity (poor knowledge about potential outcome) and ignorance; see Linke et al. (2016) for further explanation."
182,12,0.454,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Expanding beyond much-studied laboratory contexts to explore the medical history of animals in zoos, on farms, in hospitals, post-mortem rooms and international policy arenas, it illuminates the diverse species that have participated in medicine, the many roles they have played in it, and how their bodies and habits have both shaped and been shaped by its ideas, practices and institutions. Crucially, the volume highlights how these diverse species forged multispecies networks, thereby extending animal historyâs typical focus on the dyadic relationships between humans and another species of animal. The third objective of this volume is to speak to the twenty-first-century initiative known as One Health (OH). featuring prominently in medical, veterinary and scientific publications, and in national and international health policy and position statements, OH pursues an expansive vision of improving health and wellbeing through the multidisciplinary study of problems at the interface of humans, animals and their environments. for its proponents, OH represents a necessary response to a host of shared threats to human and animal health, such as emerging diseases that transmit between animals and humans, antimicrobial resistance, food insecurity, food safety and climate change. They argue that such issues cannot be tackled effectively within the traditional disciplinary compartments of human medicine, veterinary medicine and the life sciences. Rather, integrated, coordinated approaches are required, in which the health of animals is considered in relation to the health of humans and the environment.6 This volume situates OH within a longer historical context by illuminating certain precedents to this way of working. It also offers a critical, empirically grounded perspective on its operation today by exploring the circumstances that gave rise to its emergence as a self-conscious movement, and how its proponents conceptualize the roles of animals within it. In addressing these three objectives, the volume also addresses three distinct audiences: historians of animals, historians of science and medicine, and health professionals concerned with OH today. The remainder of this chapter introduces the history of animals as a field of enquiry, and situates this study in relation to it. While historians of animals will be familiar with its discussion of the methodological and conceptual issues"

Ulrich Beck has proposed the concept of ârisk societyâ to describe modern societies. However, this idea has sparked debates. The first concerns modernity. What Europe experienced during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries took place in two generations in some Asian countries. Kyung-Sup Chang (2010) has proposed the concept of âcompressed modernityâ to account for this phenomenon. The second concerns the concept of risk itself, which, in the field of food, is charged with reducing the problem to its health-related dimensions. In the last three decades, the West has faced several big food crises, especially that of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). In this context, the question of âriskâ in food safety has taken a particularly important place, in both scholarly and secular conceptions. This hegemonic J.-P.

The deadline imposed by having this book available at the International Society for Industrial Ecologyâs 2015 conference has meant that some topics we would have liked to include are not represented. Complex systems are obviously relevant to industrial ecology, but at least there are many good introductory texts on complex systems. As will be obvious through some of the chapters of the book (see, e.g. Chaps. 8, 9, 10 and 17), the social sciences are increasingly interested in and of interest to industrial ecology. Some of this work, e.g. Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl (2007), overlaps with another emerging field â ecological economics â but there is a growing interest in what the social sciences can contribute to and learn from industrial ecology. For this we refer the reader to Boons and Howard-Grenville (2009) and to Baumann et al. (forthcoming). We hope that new readers and experienced industrial ecologists alike will find this a useful and interesting volume that takes stock of where industrial ecology has got to a quarter of a century after Frosch and Gallopoulos first introduced the term and that also provides insights into the challenges ahead.

180,322,0.446,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Environmental health and occupational health and safety have long been established subfields of public health research, policy, and practice (Frumkin 2010). More so perhaps than areas such as infectious disease or health promotion, environmental and occupational health remind us that the health of a society is profoundly affected by its economic system and economic development. Today, the environmental health field is largely concerned with a human-made (anthropogenic) environment brought about by urbanization, the extraction of natural resources, industrial manufacture, the physical separation of home and workplace, and the transportation systems needed to support this mode of economy and pattern of living. Economic development alters the natural environment and sometimes harms ecosystems in terms of the humanly useful services they provide, their diversity, and their resilience. We are coming to understand that all of this has significant consequences for human health. Environmental health has been understood as a public health issue in relation to air quality, water quality, and exposure to environmental pollutants that are toxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic or are chemically bioactive in other ways. The rise of fossil fuels as the energy base for economic production and transportation, the industrial-scale advances in mining and metallurgy, and the creation and widespread presence of synthetic chemical substances have contributed to environmental health risks throughout the past two centuries. Indeed, these changes have redefined the meaning of environmental health.

These and many others are all global challenges with environmental and resource dimensions. Increasingly, people and organizations are using Earth observations and scientiï¬c information about the Earth to gain insights on and inform their policy and management decisions related to these challenges. Along with numerous organizations globally, NASA has been a key contributor to the wealth of data and information about the Earth and its processes. In addition, NASA has helped advance global knowledge about effective ways to apply the data and information across sectors and thematic areas. There are countless examples on how organizations have and are using Earth observations to support speciï¬c analyses, decisions, and associated actions. Many of these examples have been qualitative and anecdotal. The substantiation of Earth observation beneï¬ts in societal and economic terms poses key challenges, yet this quantitative substantiation is of strategic importance to the Earth observation community as it expands efforts to inform decisions. It is at the heart of the value proposition. In addition, it comes at a time when there are increasing efforts to encourage greater integration of the social and economic sciences with natural sciences as well as global efforts to use data and indicators to address sustainability. This chapter describes NASAâs work to enable uses and applications of Earth observations, as well as efforts to quantify the socioeconomic impact and showcase the overall value of space-based observations."

347,279,0.443,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Science-based advice is universally regarded and used as a primary trustworthy basis for environmental management and decision-making. However, at the same time, in many areas, there is an ambiguity and increasing concern about the sole dependence on expertise from the (natural) sciences, which often acts to the detriment of sufficient consideration of other knowledge claims, stakeholder perspectives and values held by actors such as NGOs, citizens or business people. Bijker et al. (2009: 1) have called this phenomenon the paradox of scientific authority and asked the question of âhow can scientific advice be effective and influential in an age in which the status of science and/or scientists seems to be as low as it has ever been?â One reason for this paradox lies in the fact that science becomes politicised whenever it is called into a political context (Weingart 1999) and is hence subject to constraints, i.e. rules, norms and evaluation criteria, other than those set by the scientific community. A basic challenge is that the demarcation that exists between the spheres of science and politics falls apart in such contexts, which consequently leads to concerns and potential conflicts about the legitimate role of science and its relation to policy. Both the role of science-based advice and the political decisions based on it may therefore become contested with respect to credibility, legitimacy and accountability (cf. Cash et al. 2003). In management practice, a distinction is often made between a science system (representing factual knowledge claims) and a social system (representing political, business and other concerns of public life) â a division that is inscribed in the institutional design of most policy systems in modern societies. Science is responsible for providing the best available knowledge in terms of a presumed value-free and objective input to political decision-making, which is accordingly seen as most rational and democratically legitimated (Funtowicz and Strand 2007; Wilson 2009). This idealised model of interaction between science and policy relies on what has been called the âideal causal chainâ of implementing scientific knowledge in policy processes (Fig. 8.1; Gezelius 2008). The ecosystem approach to management (EAM) is seen as a necessary and idealistic approach for managing marine resources and other environmental issues with regard to all five areas of environment and risks analysed here (Backer et al. 2010; Garcia et al. 2003; Hammer 2015).

Spearheaded by the International Council for Science (ICSU) and others, the newly launched Future Earth sustainability research initiative is expected to play a key role in providing a reinforced, overarching framework for sustainability science (Yasunari 2013). The platform for enhancing the science-policy interface needs to be bolstered by building upon the prototype recently provided by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Takeuchi 2013). Sciences that address risks and sustainability are changing to involve multiple actors in addressing issues from a trans-disciplinary perspective across a wider range of temporal and spatial scales (Benn et al. 2008). Universities must be pivotal players in transforming the platform of trans-disciplinary science to support risk management and the promotion of sustainability."
167,192,0.441,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"The last section of this chapter deal with three infectious diseases that were all common in the past, and that are considered as minor threats today. Nevertheless, they all bear a potential risk for the future related to changes in the Arctic. Two hundred years ago infectious diseases dominated the high mortality in the Arctic countries. In Sweden smallpox killed more than 300,000 people between 1750 and 1800, in a country with only 2 million inhabitants. After the introduction of vaccine in the early 1800s smallpox mortality decreased rapidly, and in 1976 the World Health Organization declared the disease as totally eradicated from Earth. This was the first infectious disease that human health prevention actively got rid of (SkÃ¶ld 1996). 1918â1920 an influenza pandemic swept over the world, killing between 50 and 100 million people. The Arctic, and especially the Indigenous peoples, were heavily struck. In local communities in Alaska the disease killed up to 90% of the entire population (Mamelund et al. 2013). Anthrax is an infection by bacteria that was already mentioned in the bible as a disease of herbivores, it remained a major cause of death for animals all over the planet until the end of the nineteenth century, with occasional, sometimes extensive, contamination of human beings. Untreated the disease has a fatality rate higher than 90% (Schwartz 2009). What then do these three terrible diseases have in common for the future mortality risks in the Arctic? The answer is the consequences of melting permafrost. Smallpox, influenza and anthrax are relatively resistant to external factors and can survive for long, also in ice. When reports of an anthrax outbreak in Siberia came in 2016, it was stated that the bacteria originated from dead reindeer in 1941 (Nechepurenko 2016; Revitch et al. 2012). Severe epidemics with these diseases would have terrible results, not least since immunity status of the present-day populations is very low, in the case of smallpox non-existing. This is a somewhat neglected consequence of climate change that needs to be highlighted."
182,301,0.44,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Drawing on these developments, in 2005, Professor Jakob Zinsstag and a group of his colleagues at the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute (STPH) published an article in the international medical journal The Lancet arguing for the OH approach.54 Bringing OH to a much bigger audience, including medical doctors and public health professionals, Zinsstag et al. started their article with a discussion of Schwabe and OM (citing VMHH) before proceeding to discuss the importance of ecosystem health (citing the WCS). They argued that OH needed to extend beyond the specifics of human and veterinary medicine and include broader ideas about health as wellbeing. They, in turn, added their own perspectives, to place a greater emphasis on research into tropical medicine and livestock health. They also introduced the public health concept of âhealth systemsâ, defined by the WHO as âall organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activitiesâ.55 This further broadened 53 for examples of the OWOH logo, see Cook et al.

86,453,0.44,Nuclear Back-End and Transmutation Technology For Waste Disposal : Beyond The Fukushima Accident,"The Review Committee of SCJ consists of various experts from wide-ranging academic fields from physical science, engineering, life science, social science, and humanities. The proposal concerning awareness of the limits of scientific and technical abilities was formed through interdisciplinary discussions among the experts. Some readers of the SCJ report seem to have felt uneasiness with this proposal because this proposal apparently cast a scientific doubt on the feasibility of the geological disposal of HLW. To the authorâs understanding, this proposal is a rather general statement that there is no perfect scientific evidence to support the safety of HLW disposal for more than 10,000 years. Having heard the discussions related to this proposal, the author recognized there are many different academic approaches depending on the field of science. For example, natural scientists seek truths in natural phenomena, whereas engineers try to make things and/or systems that are valuable and acceptable for human society. HLW issues are related not only to various fields of science, but also to value systems shared by society. Here again, the author was convinced that we need to reflect more deeply on the relationship between science and society."
302,369,0.44,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Abstract The diagnosis that we are living in a world risk society formulated by Ulrich Beck 20 years ago (Beck, Kâ¬ olner Z Soziol Sozialpsychol 36:119â147, 1996) has lost nothing of its power, especially against the background of the Anthropocene debate. âGlobal risksâ have been identified which are caused by human activities, technology, and modernization processes. Microplastics are a by-product of exactly these modernization processes, being distributed globally by physical processes like ocean currents, and causing effects far from their place of origin. In recent years, the topic has gained great prominence, as microplastics have been discovered nearly everywhere in the environment, raising questions about the impacts on food for human consumption. But are microplastics really a new phenomenon or rather a symptom of an old problem? And exactly what risks are involved? It seems that the phenomenon has accelerated political actionâthe USA has passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015âand industries have pledged to fade out the use of microbeads in their cosmetic products. At first sight, is it a success for environmentalists and the protection of our planet? This chapter deals with these questions by adopting a social-ecological perspective, discussing microplastics as a global risk. Taking four main characteristics of global risks, we develop four arguments to discuss (a) the everyday production of risk by societies, (b) scientific risk evaluation of microplastics, (c) social responses, and (d) problems of risk management. To illustrate these four issues, we draw on different aspects of the current scientific and public debate. In doing so, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the social-ecological implications of microplastics."
232,295,0.439,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"5 An Idea of Remedy: Revisit the Origin of âResilienceâ Concept It is obvious that this aporia very badly spoils our post-disaster resilience. It prevents our recovery process from the damages caused by the accident, spoils improvement of technology based on the lessons of it, delays advancement of robustness of the society and obstracts any other proactive efforts responding to the disaster. Public outrage can never have positive effect for society to exert its resilience thoroughly, if it is just neglected or poorly cared. Some (engineering) experts may still argue that this problem is solvable by âeducationâ of public (that encourage them to accept expertsâ notion): we should let them know that we need to keep those two things separated to make our society resilient and to prevent the next similar failure. If this is a discussion about just âfailure,â not âaccident,â it might be possible to maintain this strategy. However, it is an indisputable principle of modern democratic society that we must take care of the issue of damage and responsibility with deliberate ethical considerations and the deep sense of social justice. That is the nature of âdisaster.â Therefore, it is"

If we take the category âanimalâ to include bacteria, then the gradual, piecemeal later-nineteenth-century shift from miasmatic to bacteriological theories of infection, and concurrent discussions of the evolution and spontaneous generation of disease, reveal how doctors perceived microorganisms to shape and be shaped by their surroundings: Michael Worboys.

97,306,0.433,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","The pathways leading to beneficial health effects of green space are diverse and complex. Various models have been formulated to explain the relationship between green space and health. Hartig et al. (2014) suggested four interacting pathways through which green space can affect health and well-being: (1) improved air quality, (2) enhanced physical activity, (3) stress compensation and (4) greater social cohesion. Lachowycz and Jones (2013) proposed physical activity, engagement with nature, relaxation, and social interactions as major pathways to health. Villanueva et al. (2015) argued that urban green spaces mitigate the urban heat island effect providing protection from heat-related health hazards, improve social capital and cohesion, and enhance physical activity. In addition to the pathways outlined above, Kuo (2015) suggested exposure to natural microbes and enhanced immune system functioning as a major pathway linking nature and health. Relative contributions of different pathways as well as their potential synergistic effects remain to be elucidated. Meanwhile, insufficient knowledge of underlying causal pathways to health outcomes and the complex modifying social and environmental factors hinders the implementation of focused policy interventions. An in-depth interdisciplinary research is needed to close these knowledge gaps in the area of urban environment and health (Shanahan et al. 2015). This chapter focuses on the discussion of, and the health impacts related to (1) improved relaxation and restoration, (2) improved functioning of the immune system, (3) enhanced physical activity and (4) improved social capital. Health and societal benefits related to ecosystem services (e.g. reduction of air pollution, noise, exposure to excessive heat) will be discussed in the next chapter."
97,233,0.433,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","initiatives and an ever-growing evidence base of the effectiveness and associated costs/benefits of SUDS serve as strong countermeasures. Here, it is important to make lessons learned and data gathered from existing cases more widely available. New pilot or demonstration projects should also be promoted and invested in which are collaborative in nature and strengthen the links between researchers, practitioners and relevant community stakeholders. Finally, the targeted involvement of groups that are perhaps not traditionally interested in drainage matters, such as those in the health or transport sectors, and encouragement of exchanges between companies having implemented SUDS and those pursuing purely grey solutions can also benefit the mainstreaming of SUDS. These efforts can in turn strengthen the âbusiness caseâ for SUDS by instilling more confidence in and drawing attention to their wider benefits produced, low comparative associated costs, and climate change compatible nature. Such evidence will help to refute public and political hesitation as compares to traditional grey infrastructure approaches to water management. Highlighting the delivery of the multiple benefits produced in addition to flood protection which traditional engineered flood protection schemes cannot deliver is a central element. New businessmodels for public-private partnerships are a further aspect of this process, combining blue/green spaces, human well-being, water management and climate change adaptation interests (see Box 8.2 for an example). Establishing such âbusiness caseâ arguments will serve as the foundation for increased investment, public and political support and ultimately SUDS deployment. Once confidence exists that SUDS are effective and affordable as a nature-based solution technology, governments can increasingly support wider implementation. Means to do so include establishing an adequate legal framework that builds upon the evidence gathered and â alongside financial agreements/investment banks â helping to bridge the gap between short-term thinking and long-term investments via intentional regulatory design. At the EU level and in other industrialized countries, potential actions could experiment with and adjust institutional settings, considering alternative local capacities and site-specific cultural aspects. By requiring use of the technology and establishing duties for adoption and maintenance, governments can ensure the implementation of SUDS and facilitate a transition to becoming a âbusiness as usualâ option and highlight the importance of such an approach as a national priority. More specifically, national regulators can use their authority to more actively accelerate and improve SUDS development by adopting standardized monitoring and reporting protocols and guidance and by incentivising and highlighting the importance of voluntary monitoring. A strong evidence base exists which demonstrates the effectiveness of SUDS and highlights their promise as a sustainable solution to reduce urban flooding. Yet, the significant potential for more widespread uptake remains largely untapped. Further targeted actions are necessary for increasing the acceptance and application of this nature-based solution and realizing its full potential."

182,268,0.431,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Thus, just as the parasite connected far-flung populations of diverse animals and humans, it was also a primary vehicle for the development of careers, and a dispersed, multidisciplinary network of scientists, doctors and veterinarians. In part, the extended association that Schwabe formed with E. granulosus should be seen in terms of the history of the field of parasitology, whose grounding in late nineteenth-century tropical colonial medicine and agriculture gave it a richly contextualized perspective on infectious disease from the beginning.74 Historians have noted that this field drew from natural history, zoology and medicine, taking ecological environments and evolutionary history seriously, and questioning why particular parasites thrived in some places and not others.75 This disciplinary background provided Schwabe with an enriched biological conception of interactions between parasites and hosts, which he expressed in writing with Araujo in 1975. framing E. granulosus as the fourth member of the â[hu]man-sheep-dog ecosystemâ,76 he placed it on an equal ecological standing with the other animals in the cycle of transmission, and asked how its physiological and ecological needs were met by the body of the host. This was very different from medical and veterinary approaches which tended to identify parasites with disease, and to regard them as threats to humans and animals rather than as interacting organisms in their own right. Schwabe regarded his subject primarily as an animal, and only secondarily in terms of the disease it might cause. This chapter"

The effectiveness of landslide disaster risk reduction measures depends on scientiï¬c and technological developments for understanding disaster risk (natural hazards or events and social vulnerability), political âbuy-inâ, and on increased public awareness and education. â¢ At a higher level, social and ï¬nancial investment is vital for understanding and reducing landslide disaster risk, in particular social and institutional vulnerability through coordination of policies, planning, research, capacity development, and the production of publications and tools that are accessible, available free of charge and are easy to use for everyone in both developing and developed countries. We agree on the following initial ï¬elds of cooperation in research and capacity building, coupled with social and ï¬nancial investment: â¢ Development of people-centered early warning technology for landslides with increased precision and reliable prediction both in time and location, especially in a changing climate context. â¢ Development of hazard and vulnerability mapping, vulnerability and risk assessment with increased precision and reliability, as part of multi-hazard risk identiï¬cation and management. â¢ Development of improved technologies for monitoring, testing, analyzing, simulating, and effective early warning for landslides. â¢ Development of international teaching tools that are always updated and may be used free of charge by national and local leaders and practitioners, in developed and developing countries through the Sendai Partnerships 2015â2025. â¢ Open communication with society through integrated research, capacity building, knowledge transfer, awareness-raising, training, and educational activities to enable societies to develop effective policies and strategies for reducing landslide disaster risk, to strengthen their capacities for preventing hazards from developing into major disasters, and to enhance the effectiveness and efï¬ciency of relief programs. â¢ Development of new initiatives to study research frontiers in understanding landslide disaster risk, such as the effect of climate change on large-scale landslides and debris flows, the effective prediction of localized rainfall to provide earlier warning and evacuation, especially in developing countries, the mechanism and dynamics of submarine landslides during earthquakes that may cause or enhance tsunamis, and geotechnical studies of catastrophic megaslides for prediction and hazard assessment. All of the items above came from the discussions of ICL and its partners. Within those items, one of the most discussed parts are the effects of climate change on landslides. It was mentioned in two places as a high priority. Climate changes are studied by meteorologists, but not studied by landslide scientists and engineers. It is not easy to prove the effects of climate change on landslides in a decisive and a quantitative way. However, all agreed, in the following sentence, to add âin some landslide prone areas.â Climate change will intensify the risk of landslides in some landslide-prone areas through an increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of heavy rainfall, and shifts in the location and periodicity of heavy rainfall. Figure 1 presents a comparison of extreme rainfalls in Japan of over 100 mm/day and extreme rainfalls in Vietnam of over 51 mm/day.

In Chap. 5, James Haselip and Mike Hughes critically assess the landscape of AfricaâEurope cooperation on the topic of climate change. The authors argue that the complexity of R&I challenges for this issue calls for subtler collaborative programming and more rigorous evaluation. Critically, they emphasise the need for greater harmonisation between scientific and political priorities on climate change, and also point out that project goals should be much more precisely defined so as to ensure that results can be measured and solutions progressively improved. Chapter 6 investigates the strategic benefits of global health collaboration programmes for AfricaâEurope cooperation. Lamenting the lack of alignment or harmonisation of research priorities and cooperation patterns, its authors show how recent positive research development on health issues in Africa can foster more constructive and more balanced research partnerships with European countries and institutions. In this vein, the authors lobby for greater support for the Research Fairness Initiative (RFI), that is, as a promising emerging global standard for fostering fair and sustainable research partnerships and as a tool to establish more inclusive and better institutionalised framework for AfricaâEurope cooperation on health development and innovation. In Chap. 7, Gerard Ralphs and Isabella E. Wagner reflect on the issue of the âhealthâ of cooperative STI projects, by drawing out the distinction between project efficiency, on the one hand, and partnership effectiveness on the other. In a context where partnering can be challengingâfor reasons related to history or power imbalancesâthe authors propose a set of concrete applications to address these challenges during the partnering process. In doing so, they argue that using evaluative concepts, such as âpartnership learningâ, are needed to better situate partners within the increasingly complex political, economic and cultural settings of STI collaboration projects.

To achieve this target, over the next four years concerted efforts will be required to better understand existing levels of disaster risk and trends, to develop strategies based on a sound knowledge of current challenges and to set clear priorities and targets. This will include the establishment or enhancement of data systems to record disaster losses and to establish hazard and vulnerability assessments and disaster risk estimates. Continued collaboration and commitment by the public and private sectors to integrate disaster risk reduction into their respective policies, practices and investments is emphasized in the Sendai Framework and a call for a substantial increase in investment in disaster risk reduction is required. While some progress has been made in this regard, still more resources are needed to ensure substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives and livelihoods, and assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries. Science and technology is expected to provide valuable contributions to measuring progress through the Sendai Framework monitor, and by providing the evidence-base for the development and implementation of the national and local disaster risk reduction strategies and in public and private investment."

As human populations grow and encroach on remaining bat habitat, humanâbat interactions are increasing, often with negative consequences for both parties through disease relationships (Schneeberger and Voigt 2016), occupation of human dwellings (Voigt et al. 2016), and conflict over fruit crops (Abdul Aziz et al. 2015). The Anthropocene is named for us, and solutions to our environmental problems rest with us, as Mascia et al. (2003) so concisely put it: âBiodiversity conservation is a human endeavor: initiated by humans, designed by humans, and intended to modify human behaviorââ(Mascia et al. 2003, p. 650). Bat conservation is no different from any other aspect of biodiversity conservation in this regard; attempts to reduce the many threats to bats ultimately hinge on changing peoplesâ behavior (Stern 2000; Ehrlich and Kennedy 2005; Schultz 2011; St John et al. 2013; VerÃ­ssimo 2013; Clayton and Myers 2015). âPeopleâ may range from bat hunters in rural villages to government officials or politicians in administrative centers, but as stakeholders in the issues surrounding bats, they must be motivated to change their actions and decisions (Menon and Lavigne 2006). How do we determine the stakeholders involved and how do we then change peopleâs minds and behavior? The scientific training of most bat biologists leaves us illequipped both practically (St John et al. 2010, 2014) and philosophically (Moon and Blackman 2014) and often extraordinarily naÃ¯ve, when it comes to dealing with people. Surely, if we share our knowledge and âeducateâ people, they will change their ways. Hunters in Ghana and Indonesia will be so impressed by the importance of bats as pollinators of their favorite fruit, or so fearful of disease risk, that they will stop hunting them. US politicians will mandate turbine cut-in speeds that reduce bat fatalities once they appreciate the critical role that bats play in the suppression of agricultural insect pests. Home owners will learn to live with their seasonal âattic batsâ because they are keeping down the summer mosquito population. Unfortunately, providing people with environmental knowledge alone is rarely enough to promote conservation behavior, and there is an enormous body of research from the social sciences, primarily from social psychology (St John et al. 2010; Teel et al. 2015), addressing the theoretical constructs behind behavior change. These constructs have provided frameworks for empirical assessments of attitudes and behaviors toward the environment and wildlife, and new disciplines such as human dimensions of wildlife (Manfredo 2008; Decker et al. 2012) and conservation psychology (Clayton and Myers 2015) have arisen in recent years, as a growing numbers of social scientists specialize in environmental or biodiversity conservation. Indeed, the Society for Conservation Biology established a Social Science Working Group in 2003 (http://conbio.org/groups/working-groups/socialscience), and a recent report from the Group provides an excellent introduction to the conservation social sciences (Bennett and Roth 2015)."

Market failure will be the rule. Moreover, climate change has a significant impact on the frequency of catastrophic events worldwide. The data from the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction show a dramatic increase in the occurrence of natural disasters, particularly of hydro-meteorological events during the last century (OECD, 2009). It is clear that not all agricultural risks are insurable:14 insurance contracts for some risks do not exist because the insurance premium covering all the costs would be prohibitive (OECD, 2009). Miranda and Glauber (1997) emphasize the need for risk to be independent among the insured, arguing that due to correlations among individual yields, crop insurers face portfolio risk that is about ten times larger than that faced by private insurers offering more conventional lines of insurance (automobile, fire, etc). And also reinsurers are reluctant to take portfolios with a probability of very large obligations. Natural disasters like the Tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2006, the earthquake in Haiti in 2008, and the recent countrywide flooding in Pakistan in 2010 are examples of catastrophic risk where market instruments break down and which call for the government, supported by the international donor community, to step in with emergency aid, disaster relief, and safety net provision.

4,33,0.425,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"Child Experiences: The Stories That Make the Person When human beings become embryos, their complete genetic makeup is determined. The individuals they turn out to be is the consequence of the interaction between this genetic makeup and their life experiences. In a few cases, life experiences have no bearing on some important features, such as sex. In most cases though, the path is highly uncertain and strongly dependent on life experiences. Mounting causal evidence indicates that early experiences often have persistent, long-lasting, and significant effects on a wide array of important youth and adult outcomes. First, since developing countries have few mechanisms to cope with risk, environmental and economic shocksâsuch as severe weather, epidemiological events, or armed conflictâcan generate long-lasting negative effects, usually by way of their impact on nutrition.9 For example, Maccini and Yang (2009) look at the effect of rainfall in the Philippines; Almond (2006) studies the persistent impact of the Spanish influenza of 1918 in the United States; and Akresh and others (2012) analyze the effect of growing up during the Nigerian civil war."

We might nonetheless claim that Cacioppo and Berntson set the stage for a contemporary research landscape that â at least in certain corners â is attending carefully to the ways in which social adversity is a causal factor in mental disorder (European Network of National Networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions in Schizophrenia (EU-GEI) et al. 2014; Hyman 2009), in which the sociopolitics of stress and trauma are situated in accounts of specific psychopathologies (Galea 2011), in which specific brain regions are situated vis-Ã -vis the role they play in human social interaction (Amodio and Frith 2006), and so on. From the other direction, a range of positions in social theory have radically undercut the traditional scepticism that the social sciences (at least the qualitative social sciences) have displayed toward not only biological explanations â but any admixture of the biological and social per se. In his account of what might become of âThe Human Sciences in a Biological Ageâ, sociologist Nikolas Rose points out that, âNo longer are social theories thought progressive by virtue of their distance from the biological. Indeed the reverse assumption is common â it seems that âconstructivismâ is passÃ©, the linguistic turn has reached a dead end and a rhetoric of materiality is almost obligatoryâ (Rose 2013, 4). While retaining some critical distance from these obligations, Rose nonetheless casts a future for the social sciences in which an attention to vitality (understood not only as a philosophical commitment, but as a deep, abiding and collaborative attention to the biological stakes of human life) returns to the centre of the sociological enterprise. Similar claims have been made across a range of contemporary social theories (e.g. Braidotti 2010; Greco 2005; Grosz 2004). In our own efforts to think with and through bodies, we have been especially moved by arguments emerging from feminist science studies, and from that literature sometimes inadequately gathered together under the rubric of a âmaterial feminismâ â which has, at least since Donna Haraway first drew attention to the theoretical potency of the body positioned scientifically (Haraway 1985), pioneered such approaches. Put very broadly, a âmaterial feminismâ moves beyond an insistence on the construction of gendered bodies to ask whether feminist theory might, rather, seek resources in the materiality of the body, and in the thinking of the sciences that labour to bring that materiality into understanding. It describes a move of feminist theory beyond the âtextual, linguistic and discursiveâ, to refocus on the pains and pleasures of embodiment: âwe need a way to talk about these"

There are clear human dimensions to physical and biological parameters, such as air quality conditions and land use patterns.

A U.S. National Academy of Sciences report suggested efforts âto facilitate crosscutting research focused on understanding the interaction among the climate, human, and environmental systems â¦â (NRC 2009). The Future Earth initiative stemmed from the proposal for âa new contract between science and society in recognition that science must inform policy to make more wise and timely decisions â¦â (ICSU 2012). In the U.S., the Obama Administration directed U.S. Federal agencies in 2015 to factor the value of ecosystem services into Federal planning and decision-making (OMB 2015).

Hence, reductions in bat populations as a result of hunting could have expensive ramifications on local communitiesâ water supplies, agriculture, and eco-tourism industries. Finally, the hunting of bats may also expose human communities to potentially zoonotic pathogens (Leroy et al. 2005). In the past decade, considerable attention has been paid to bats as natural reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases (Calisher et al. 2006). Studies that link infectious disease outbreaks to bats demonstrate the spillover potential through contact with bats or exposure to faeces and urine in bat habitats (reviewed by Plowright et al. 2015). Most notable are the Ebola virus outbreaks, which have attracted international attention. Leroy et al. (2009) suggest that the 2007 emergence of Ebola virus in the Occidental Kasai province of DRC could be attributable to the consumption of freshly killed bats. The authors trace the virus spread from a first patient with bat bushmeat contact to an outbreak of the disease in 260 persons resulting in 186 deaths in 2007. The re-emergence of the disease in 2014 may also have arisen from contact with bats (SaÃ©z et al. 2015) and has proven far more deadly."

Table 3.4 provides a comparative overview of these concepts. They have co-evolved and are widely overlapping in terms of their scope and definition of nature. On the one hand, they are motivated by the concern to better protect nature, and specifically biodiversity, in a human-dominated world. On the other hand, the use of nature is considered as an option to complement, improve or even replace traditional engineering approaches, for example, for stormwater management. Therefore, all four concepts are clearly focusing on human interests, aiming to assert the environmental, social and economic benefits that people gain from nature. Moreover, they are problem-focused and they require inter- and transdisciplinary approaches. For instance, EbA is considered to tackle the challenge of climate change adaptation from multiple academic fields and concepts, e.g.,"

The WCS veterinarians built on this idea, bringing it together with Schwabeâs âvisionary attempts â¦ to construct a bridge between medicine and agricultureâ to argue for a broader collaborative approach to improving the health of humans, animals and environments, which they described as OH.51 These wildlife veterinarians developed the idea of OH primarily to advance their conservation agenda, but it was particularly grounded in thinking about problems of infectious disease, especially zoonoses. Their thinking around zoonotic diseases was, and is, unusually broad. While the WHO defines âzoonosisâ as disease transmission between animals and humans, most actors in global public health today use the term to denote the transmission of infections from animals to humans. By contrast the WCS group and their collaborators discuss the movement of infectious diseases between multiple species, back and forth across wildlife and livestock, humans and animals, much as Schwabe did when challenging the humanâanimal distinction at the core of âzoonosisâ.52 If anything, the WCS group took this even further, highlighting the particular risks of transmitting common human infectious diseases to endangered species of wildlife. This understandingâthat humans form part of an interconnected network of organisms including wildlife, domestic animals and microorganismsâwas underlined by the logo the group used for OWOH, which depicted a âparadeâ of silhouetted wild and domestic 50 for example: Cook et al.

The more complex systems, the more direct interventions will induce side effects, and the less they are likely to succeed. Finally, one debate connected with systems approaches is that about the ontological status of a system. There is a position that systems are ârealâ. Thus, a system is understood as existing in the real world; it has ontological status, i.e. exists independent from an observer. The alternative viewpoint is that systems are analytical constructions by the observer. The elements, relations and boundaries of the system are defined by the observer, who has a certain interest in the analysis. Thus, systems can be considered as systems of interests. Science or any other societal community define system perspectives to analyse certain types of problems. In this sense, systems are socially constructed entities (by a group rather than by an individual). For example, from a biological perspective, it seems at a glance self-evident that the human is defined by the boundaries of the body. However, the body is settled by microbes that may be both dangerous (e.g. viruses) and helpful (e.g. millions"
10,155,0.419,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Although this book and project are focused on drought governance and resilience, the flooding events that occurred in Somerset across 2012â2014 have signiï¬cantly influenced the long-term water management futures of the Somerset region. Thus, it is also useful to overview the developments to flood policy and how they have influenced adaptation actions towards drought and water scarcity governance. The flooding in 2013â2014 included the flooding of the Parrett and the Tone catchments. It was the largest flood event known to have occurred in the region in the last 250 years with the army being deployed to assist during the crisis (BBC 2014; Environment Agency 2015b; see also Fig. 5.2). The floods became a hot political topic during the immediate crisis and recovery, with national and European media presence covering the contested and strongly debated causes, and solutions, to the problem. Thorne (2014) reflected how the 2013/2014 floods were socially divisive, with our own research during the period of flooding recovery highlighting the de-legitimisation of various stakeholders involved in water management throughout these public debates. It can be argued that the flood event obscured some options for recovery and future adaptation and entrenched others (Browne 2014; Butler and Walker-Springett 2015). The flood event also offered an opportunity for improving resilience, resistance and relations between the public, various regional stakeholders and other water practitioners (Butler and Walker-Springett 2015). The policy developments that emerged as a result of these flood events need to be viewed in the context of the divisive and contested nature of the flood recovery process, throughout which there was a series of social and political struggles to maintain a more or less balanced policy response. The EA, whose funding and investment decisions are based on national assessment and cost beneï¬t analysis, is currently the main provider of flood risk management activities. After the flood event of 2013/14, the 20 Year Flood Action Plan was developed to achieve a long-term vision for the area to reduce the extent and impact of flooding (Cameron 2014). The plan includes works being done to repair flood defences in the region, build new flood defences and enhance the capacity of various drains in the region to reduce the risk, depth and duration of any floods in the future (Environment Agency 2015b). It also identiï¬ed dredging around the Levels and Moors to reduce flood risks (Environment Agency 2014), creating new banks, increasing pumping capacity and additional maintenance activities such as weed control (Environment Agency 2015b). The implementation of the 20 Year Flood Action Plan is being spearheaded by FWAG SW (a sub-partner on the DROP project). The Somerset Rivers Authority (SRA) is a key part of the 20 Year Flood Action Plan. The SRA will bring together the Flood Risk Management Authorities (the EA, the Internal Drainage Boards, the Lead Local Flood Authority (SCC) and the other Somerset local authorities), to provide a strategic overview of the continued delivery of the Flood Action Plan, and to develop, agree and publish a Common"

His craving is to transform it into a predictable tool, to domesticate it into a normal object, so that university discourse can function smoothly again. A working vaccine would have been a perfect outcome in this disruptive struggle for power between the researcher and his virus ($ â a). In that case, the phage would have ended his discontent, his anonymity, by making him famous, turning his life into a success story after all. But the idea of medical benefits functions as a faÃ§ade, a pretext for his urge to dominate nature in her most elementary (viral and microbial) dimensions, working himself into a state of neurasthenia â in accordance with Dostoyevskyâs insistence that intellectual activity is, in final instance, a âdiseaseâ (1864/1972, p. 18). In conclusion, we are not confronted with a moral dilemma in the sense of a problem that can be solved by developing or abiding to rules and regulations, such as the codes of conduct and ethical principles of research with human subjects. Although such practices (developed by professional ethicists) may help to subdue the tension, making microbial research more manageable no doubt, they will not abolish the basic divide. The desire to control life may become addictive precisely because it is driven by a disruptive compulsion. As a science novel, Arrowsmith opens up and dramatizes this basic rupture, thus furthering our awareness of the gap between what basic research produces and what clinical medicine basically needs. And this divide not only affects the knowledge dimension, but the normative dimension (the level of morality and of the Self) as well. According to Arrowsmith, what is considered integrity in the realm of basic research is regarded as misconduct in medical practice, and vice versa. But this may not the final word. Arrowsmith is the first real science novel, as we have seen. In the next sections we will explore how these tensions are addressed in other novels, notably in Chap. 7 (Cantorâs dilemma) and Chap. 9 (Intuition)."

The IDAH2O Master Water Stewards program, offered by University of Idaho, aims at involving citizens in collection of water quality data in streams in Idaho, USA [44]. In North American citizen scientists have collected data for bird watching programs and have helped scientists develop guidelines for land managers [45]. The increased use of CS can thus be viewed as a way for science to be informed by citizens but at the same time, and very importantly for risk perception, as a means for citizens to obtain a better understanding of the scientific field in focus [46]. As mentioned earlier knowledge is vital for the risk perception. Where risk is perceived as higher by citizens than by experts within the field, it is often the unfamiliarity that is a key psychological driver for risk perception [6]. But there might also be scenarios where citizens are not fully aware of a risk, until they are involved in collecting data for it under a CS program. In these situations, people might underestimate risk due to the lack of knowledge. CS can thus help people to obtain more informed perceptions about a given risk and thereby facilitate a process of transformative learning that can ultimately result in citizens changing the perception of a given problem [47]. Collaboration between citizens and scientists not only influences citizenâs risk perception but may also influence the values and beliefs that the scientists possess and ultimately their risk perception as well. This led Gibbons et al. [48] to suggest the distinction between mode 1 and mode 2 researches. Mode 1 research characterizes the traditional disciplinary scientific endeavor in closed scientific communities, and mode 2 research describes a transdisciplinary type of knowledge production where scientists and citizens collaborate to define both problems and solutions. Elements of this way of looking at research can today be found in, for example, the â¬80 billion European research and innovation program Horizon2020. Horizon2020 is based on three pillars: the excellence pillar that resembles the mode 1 research, the industrial leadership that mainly focuses on innovation in the private sector, and the Societal Challenges pillar that with requirements for multi-actor approach and co-innovation resembles the mode 2 research."

These participants argued that different types of ârationalityâ should be considered more intensively when society makes decisions regarding science and technology issues. This controversy is associated with the previous point, of course. â¢ Prof. William Kastenberg raised an issue about âsafety cultureâ in the Japanese nuclear industry (see Chap. 9). He pointed out its weakness in light of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and its consequences, and suggested an explanation of the roots of this weakness based on cultural and historical differences between Western and Asian societies. He illustrated the importance of individualism when considering engineering ethics. This argument triggered much discussion regarding the character of social-scientific explanation and analysis of the root cause of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Some participants questioned Prof. Kastenbergâs theory. This contestation also extended the horizon of participantsâ perspectives on the mechanism behind the tragedy. â¢ Many participants also focused on the importance and difficulty of public and inter-expert communication during emergency situations (so-called âcrisis communicationâ). They described some dilemmas: timely information vs. well-confirmed information, simple and understandable explanation vs. detailed and correct explanation, controlled disclosure vs. unlimited disclosure, and so on. Participants realized the possible tough choices for engineers posed by those dilemmas. As we intended, no particular single conclusion was reached on these complex and difficult issues during this summer school. However, students reported that they conceptualized such dilemmas more sharply than they did before as a result of interactions with people who took different stances, brought different methodological perspectives, and held divergent opinions."

299,478,0.417,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Technological pessimists, by contrast, refer to âthe sense of disappointment, anxiety, even menaceâ engendered by technology (Marx 1994, p. 11). According to them, technology frequently if not always has unintended negative side effects that are worse than its contributions to dealing with the problem the technology purports to solve. The negative consequences of technology may be delayed, but never avoided (Huesemann and Huesemann 2011). Other scholars hold that such negative effects are inherent to the very nature of technology; according to Michael and Joyce Huesemann, â[g]iven that the second law of thermodynamics guarantees that for each unit of âorderâ (neg-entropy) created in the human-based economy, more than one unit of âdisorderâ (entropy) is created in the surrounding environment, it follows that all industrial activities must lead to unavoidable environmental disruptionsâ (2011, pp. 18â19). Professor Robert Gordon argues that most if not all truly revolutionary technological innovations have already been made (Krugman 2016). Scholars such as Nick Carr, Jonathan Zittrain, Sherry Turkle, and Jason Lanier hold that technologyâespecially technology associated with the media and with the internetâhas had negative impacts on the ways human beings think and interact with each other (McAfee 2010). Techno pessimists rarely see a technological fix that passes muster. For instance, they fear that geoengineering will increase acid rain, and is likely to reduce the urgency that is critical to mustering the political will to permanently address climate change (The Hidden Dangers of Geoengineering 2008; What is Geoengineering? 2011). (Early critics of geoengineering were so vehemently opposed to the idea that they left death threats on the voice machine of its most famous advocate, David Keith (Grolle 2013).) Others point out that although âonly nuclear power can satisfy humanityâs long-term energy needs while preserving the environmentâ (Hannum et al. 2005) nuclear reactors generate highly radioactive waste that is dangerous if not stored with the utmost care; reprocessing this waste is expensive and increases the possibility of the waste being accessed and used for malicious purposes (Fahey 2009). Radical techno pessimists urge us to leave the high-growth pathway needed for the affluent society, a path that presumes ever-greater reliance on technological innovation, in favor of returning to a simpler life. Such a life would entail adapting to nature rather than seeking to exploit it. Less radical technological pessimists instead believe that we should focus on activities that add less to the triple challenge. Technological innovation, these moderate techno pessimists point out, has its placeâas long as it first and foremost helps to ameliorate the harms already inflicted upon the earth by humans. For some, this entails greatly increased reliance on âalternativeâ sources of energy such as solar and wind; for others, it means increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings and cars. All, in effect, favor a less active, more adaptive world."
284,313,0.416,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"ecosystems on which they and we all depend. Regardless of where one turns in the region, there is an increase in the number and intensity of conï¬icts between groups committed to promoting economic development (i.e. growth), and those claiming to speak for the planet and/or the welfare of the large majority of the population or particular minorities, who feel excluded from these processes and are bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of these activities. This chapter addresses some of the underlying causes of these conï¬icts by giving voice to some of the actors who are actually involved in developing their own alternatives to the development proposals of the hegemonic forces driving the transformations in their societies. These alternatives emerge from groups whose organizations are shaped by different cosmologies, products of their multiple ethnic origins, and by the profound philosophical and epistemological debates of the past half-century that emerged from numerous social movements proposing different strategies for achieving progress, improving wellbeing and conserving ecosystems. While many past confrontations among social groups have produced compromises modifying individual development projects, few have created some space for the emergence of alternative social and productive structures that respond to the demands for local control of the governance process to assure local wellbeing and responsible environmental management. The analysis draws on an important emerging literature that proposes a different epistemology and methodology, reï¬ecting the direct participation of a diversity of communities around the world in research about themselves and their possibilities for implementing different approaches to improving their wellbeing. In spite of the widely separated regions and traditions from which they come, there are striking commonalities in their reï¬ections on how research should be conducted and how they might collaborate with âoutsidersâ in their search for ways to advance in their pursuit of an improved style of life and their ability to govern themselves. A notable early contribution from this intellectual and academic current was published by a Maori sociologist (Smith, 2012), reacting to the tendency of scholars from the principal academic institutions in New Zealand to make assumptions about local social structures, production possibilities, and the possibilities of and competence for innovations of their âaboriginesâ. Since this early text, a burgeoning literature has emerged, not only emphasizing the methodological limitations of much Western scholarship in the Third World but also extending the critique to epistemological, ethical and cosmological planes.

230,6,0.416,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"The accumulation of litter at sea and along coastlines worldwide and the many open questions concerning the amount, distribution and fate of marine litter and potential implications for marine wildlife and humans have raised public awareness, stimulated scientific research and initiated political action to tackle this environmental problem (UNEP 2014). Identification, quantification and sampling of marine litter do not necessarily require professional scientific skills so that NGOs as well as committed citizens and other stakeholders have contributed substantially to the collection of data on marine litter pollution and to the global perception of the problem (Rosevelt et al. 2013; Anderson and Alford 2014; Smith and Edgar 2014). Scientists, politicians, authorities, NGOs and industries have started to share knowledge at international conferences aimed at developing managerial solutions. These joint activities, public awareness and, finally, the scientific curiosity of numerous committed researchers have stimulated a rapidly increasing number of publications from various scientific disciplines in dedicated volumes (Coe and Rogers 1997; Thompson et al. 2009). This latest volume on Marine Anthropogenic Litter was inspired by the remarkable recent progress in marine litter research. A large proportion of the references reviewed in this book was published in the last three years demonstrating the topicality of this book and the issue as a whole. Because of the high dynamics in this field of research, this volume may already be outdated when published. This book consists of five major sections. In the first section, Peter Ryan gives a historical synopsis of marine litter research starting from the first mention of floating debris in the famous novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in 1870 but with a focus on the past 50 years, which have seen a strong increase in the production of plastics. The reader will learn about the rapid development of this research field, and a series of international key conferences such as the âHonolulu Conferencesâ, which brought together scientists, environmentalists, industry, NGOs and policy makers and fuelled numerous publications and new research and management schemes. The second section of the book addresses abiotic aspects of marine litter pollution. FranÃ§ois Galgani, Georg Hanke and Thomas Maes portray the abundance, global distribution and composition of marine litter, which illustrates the ubiquity of litter in the oceans from the urban centres of human activity to the Earthâs remotest sites. Anthony L. Andrady describes the physical and chemical processes involved in the degradation of plastics in the marine environment. The third section of the book covers the biological and ecological implications of marine litter. Susanne KÃ¼hn, Elisa L. Bravo Rebolledo and Jan A. van Franeker summarize the deleterious effects of litter on marine wildlife. The authors compiled an extensive list of 580 species, ranging from invertebrates to fish, turtles, birds and mammals that have been shown to suffer from the effects of marine litter. Toxicity of contaminants associated with marine plastic debris as well as health implications is described by Chelsea Rochman who demonstrates that plastics are more than a mechanic threat to marine biota. Tim Kiessling, Lars Gutow and Martin Thiel show how marine litter facilitates the dispersal of marine organisms, which are capable of colonizing litter items floating at the sea surface. The authors compiled a list of 387 taxa that have been found rafting on floating litter,"

There were a growing number of references to ânatural computingâ, meaning computational processes in nature. One of the influential pioneers was Nobel laureate David Baltimore, who claimed that biology had become an information science (Baltimore 2002). Others argued similar things for economics, physics, chemistry, cognitive science, and other fields in the physical, life, and social sciences (Kari and Rozenberg 2008). The rapid emergence and development of natural computing is an amazing turnaround from the 1960s, when Simon argued that computing is a science even if it studies artificial phenomena, and when many others believed that the field of computing is fully reducible to mathematics. Today scientists in other fields are saying that their fields include information processes that occur naturally. They are telling computer scientists, âWe have information processes too!â This shift has led to a new definition of computing as a discipline as the study of information processes, both artificial and natural. This definition is important because it shifts the focus from the computer to information processes and their transformations. It is also a much more inclusive definition that allows for the computational branches of other fields, including the natural sciences. This definition also accommodates the three intellectual traditions embedded in computing, which we mentioned earlierâtheory, design, and abstraction. The theoretical tradition focuses on mathematical relationships and proofs. The design tradition focuses on the design and construction of computational circuits, machines, systems, and software. The abstraction tradition focuses on experimental work to test algorithms, validate software, find workable system configurations, and support design choices; it was advocated early (Feldman and Sutherland 1979; McCracken et al. 1979) but took many years to develop and earn a stature comparable to the theory and design methods. A combination of these three traditions gained wider currency in computing when other fields acknowledged computing as a third way of doing science and developed computational branches (Denning and Martell 2015). The 1980s experimental computer science debates, which brought methodology to limelight, were supported in the mid-1990s by methodological meta-analyses, fashionable in many other fields. Many people and research groups analyzed journal articles and conference papers in computing and other fields in order to describe methodology in computing and compare computing research with research in other fields (Tedre 2014). Those meta-analyses found great methodological differences between computingâs branches, but also revealed widespread disregard"

Traditionally, the governance approach toenvironmental problems and risks has presupposed that various phenomena in natural systems can rationally be dealt with by straightforward science-based management (Linke et al. 2016).

Thus the international aspects, including the urban aspects, of the agricultural disruption, economic disruption and logistical disruption to food availability, food access and food quality as a result of natural disasters remains an under-researched topic. Climate change is affecting (and will affect) global food production and hence global food security. Urban agriculture plays a signiï¬cant role in maintaining and improving the health of city dwellers, particularly those disadvantaged. Climate changes are likely to impact more severely on urban environments with associated negative effects on food security, as has been discussed. Existing research programmes are not addressing these aspects of climate change effectively and deserve immediate attention.

198,58,0.415,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"emissions can be measured through technical processes, there is no similar measurement for adaptation. No single indicator for adaptation will suffice. We argue that adaptation has at least three distinct dimensions: (1) changes in social and economic development that ensure that the outputs and outcomes are sustainable from a climate change perspective; (2) preparedness for and dealing with natural disasters that may increase in intensity due to climate change; (3) resilience of populations and societies to tackle unexpected changes in the natural environment that they are living in. The first dimension increasingly overlaps with mitigation action. While mitigation may be primarily directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the micro-macro paradox establishes clearly that for these actions to be ultimately successful, systems need to change and become environmentally sustainable. This is the route towards durable emission reductions, and it is also the route towards increased adaptive capacity. For this reason we see an increasing use of the same transformative mechanisms for adaptation as for mitigation. Adaptation and mitigation are two different but linked dimensions in social, economic and environmental sustainability. Adaptation concerns the ways in which the social and economic domains are âreadyâ for change in the environmental domain, and includes resulting actions. Mitigation focuses on one particular way society and the economy use natural resources and aims to make this use environmentally sustainable. Adaptation perspectives in mitigation often are termed âclimate proofingâ of actions; ensuring that the mitigation interventions will be resilient against climate change. Both adaptation and mitigation ultimately require action that transforms the interaction between the social, economic and environmental domains. One of us argued that sustainability is fundamentally an adaptation issue (van den Berg 2014, p. 34â35): âachieving a sustainable balance among civil society, the economy and the environment will require constant adaptationâ. In this light we include some of the evaluative evidence on adaptation in our discussion of transformative action."
222,72,0.415,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This book builds on insights from a multidisciplinary perspective on ecosystem services and their importance to human well-being and applies these ideas in deltas in an integrated manner to inform decision-making for poverty alleviation. There is, of course, a wide variety of approaches and unresolved questions and relationships between elements of wellbeing and the underlying ecosystem processes (Norgaard 2010; Pascual et al. 2017; Suich et al. 2015). But at their core, the key scientific issues relate to how ecosystems bring multiple benefits to society, both in material terms and through other pathways. The benefits from ecosystem services include those associated with direct economic use, with protecting health and mitigation of hazards. The book explores the issues outlined in this chapter in detail for delta environments in order to give context to the broad assessment of the sustainability of a range of possible future trajectories within deltas, focusing on both the biophysical processes of their productivity and the prospects for securing ecosystem services for poverty alleviation objectives. The following chapters also, for the first time, explore in a systematic manner how social processes such as migration, access and property rights, and social relations interact with ecosystem services to result in the distribution of well-being in deltas. The book highlights the leverage points for action on these mechanisms that have been uncovered through integrated modelling and an increased understanding of delta socialecological systems. Integration across diverse knowledge domains and model simulation is a key and novel aspect of the research, and as such the findings in this book, linking biophysical changes to human wellbeing within a coupled model framework. This allows the exploration of possible futures in a participatory and policy-relevant manner that can engage with national stakeholders."

Vulnerability of the institutional subsystem feeds back to the socioeconomic and the ecological subsystems. Institutional components can be market structures, as when collapse of livestock enterprises led to restructuring of the regional livestock market in the 2012 drought in the USA. Institutional components involve government intervention as in the case with drought relief programs in the USA or national relief following dzud (severe winter weather disaster) in Mongolia. These interventions often do not reflect collective learning or desired collection action across the social and the institutional subsystems and thus may not facilitate resilient decision making at the enterprise or individual level (Thurow and Taylor 1999; FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez et al. 2012). As new markets, new government regulations, and climate change introduce new learning opportunities, vulnerabilities can arise at the household unit or livestock enterprise."

We express our sincere gratitude to all of the contributors to this volume, not just because they shared their insights from work on poverty and developmentâbased on decades of workâbut also because all of the contributors were kind enough to join in this effort in order to reflect in new ways on the nexus of poverty, exclusion, and ecology that is at the foundation of marginality. Several sets of discussions lead us towards this volume, including: discussions at ZEF along with our colleague Paul Vlek who kept emphasizing the societal risks of land degradation, exchanges with a large network of researchers who work to address extreme poverty, and intensive exchanges on this topic with Prabhu Pingali and Monika Zurek at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of these were helpful in shedding light on and clarifying the multifaceted marginality issues, and for identifying windows of opportunity for actions to address marginalization. An exciting international conference on marginality held at the Center for Development Research (ZEF) at the University of Bonn in 2011 was made possible due to generous financial support provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Volkswagen Foundation. Workshop participantsâbeing researchers and practitionersâcritically reviewed the presented papers at that stage and identified gaps, which we subsequently tried to fill in the preparation of this volume. Moreover, helpful critiques from three external anonymous reviewers on an earlier draft of this volume are gratefully acknowledged. We are grateful for the superb editing assistance of Erick H.

347,280,0.411,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"practices need to adapt to new ways of giving, using and implementing various sorts of advice. This shift towards EAM is furthermore in line with the EUâs general principles of âgood governanceâ (COM 2001: 10) applied in various marine policies such as the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), aiming for a âbroad involvement of stakeholders at all stages of the policy from conception to implementationâ (EC 2002: 6). Our study analyses the problems and challenges faced when a traditional conceptualisation of science-policy interfaces, such as the âideal causal chainâ model, is applied to different cases of environmental governance in the Baltic Sea and suggests ways in which associated problems and challenges might be countered. Applying the EAM concept, with its aspirations to achieve sustainable use of ecosystems in line with place-based requirements and sensitivities of the socioecological system (cf. BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016), opens new opportunities for a more holistic approach to understand and design science-policy interfaces by taking both the natural system (represented via science) and the social system (sociopolitical aspects) into account (cf. Gilek et al. 2015). The widening perspective of EAM could hence contribute to avoiding some of the traditional pitfalls of narrowly assigned science-based management systems. One of these pitfalls is the strongly sector-based marine environmental governance of the Baltic Sea that is studied here. Furthermore, all our case studies present strongly politicised domains of environmental governance (albeit with case-specific differences), where the boundaries between science and policy are continuously blurred and often debated. This implies that political and cultural values heavily influence scientific processes while science on the other hand strongly influences policy developments. This phenomenon is described as the âco-production of science and policyâ (Jasanoff 2004; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998) and highlights key questions about the roles and responsibilities of different actors such as scientists (and the science system) and other relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the interplay between assessment and management. In this âco-producedâ context, new and developed institutional structures and processes of interaction could act as âboundary organisationsâ between science and policy that make environmental problems governable. As Lidskog (2014:3) states: âBy negotiating and renegotiating the boundaries between science and policy, environmental problems and their possible solutions are co-produced. Both science and policy are mobilised in order to solve a specific environmental problemâ."

341,293,0.41,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"have utility. We choose this framing because of experiences of confusion around the concept social-ecological system, especially as to how boundary judgements (to the system) and relational dynamics are understood. Our framing choice does not treat a social-biophysical system as a single entity or system, but as a relational dynamic between two systems mediated by human-invented institutions (rules of the game) and technologies. This framing is also an act of inclusion as it recognises the systemic, relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments as well as distinct relational dynamics within a social and a biophysical system (Figs. 9.3 and 9.4); situational framing sets the key initial starting conditions which give rise to inclusivity, or not. Within our preferred framing, concerns like âbiodiversity conservationâ are means of influencing the unfolding dynamic between the social and the biophysical through the design and use of new institutions that serve human purposes in relation to conservation, e.g. the institutional forms of âecosystems servicesâ if they become widespread are likely to have a major impact on this unfolding dynamic (Ison 2011). Framing choices and awareness need to operate at multiple levels and in relation to situations and practices. We have outlined our framing preference for the situations that have to be governed â structurally coupled social-biophysical systems. However, how these might be governed requires another framing choice â here our preference is to see governance situations as akin to âwicked problemsâ or situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, interdependencies, and multiple perspectives where what is at issue has to be constructed by concerned stakeholders (Ison et al. 2007, 2015a). Thus, what is, or is not, inclusive is related to the locked-in historical features of a situation that can create pathway dependencies and to initial starting conditions associated with a new issue or an emergent concern or crisis. As practice in relation to situation unfolds, there are multiple opportunities for being inclusive or not. Here we outline three matters that if not understood can affect inclusivity."
347,370,0.41,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"This means that despite some successful exceptions as exemplified above, science-based advice is far from always used effectively in Baltic Sea environmental governance. This is apparent in the cases of eutrophication (Karlsson et al. 2016) and chemicals (Karlsson and Gilek 2016), where HELCOM has established detailed regional assessments based on scientific input, but management measures are nonetheless seldom fully implemented nationally. Furthermore, risk assessments are usually established based on a conventional view of what constitutes appropriate scientific methodologies and knowledge, often overlooking non-standardised data sources, uncertainty and interactions between various risks, as well as the need for interdisciplinary perspectives and stakeholder input (Linke et al. 2016). The latter â lack of stakeholder input â might cause worsened sociopolitical controversies, especially in the presence of uncertainty. In particular, it opens up for strong politicisation where scientists without normative transparency engage in political discussions and politicians selectively interpret scientific results (Karlsson et al. 2011; Linke et al. 2016). Several chapters in the book analyse and discuss communication and stakeholder participation. Both the EU and HELCOM have invested increasingly in this area of environmental governance in recent years, as, for example, seen in HELCOMâs BSAP stakeholder conferences and in RACs under the Common Fisheries Policy (BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016; JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016; Sellke et al. 2016). To a large extent though, the case studies reveal that participation in Baltic Sea environmental governance is generally regarded as having an instrumental role to serve the requirements of public policy (BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016). It is of course positive if participation, as assumed in this instrumental framing, leads to more efficient and effective environmental governance and higher acceptance of decision-making processes. Still, this instrumental focus on participation may result in the broader democratic values of participation being overlooked (JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016). In addition, our findings indicate that regional structures and processes for stakeholder input and critique are often undeveloped or missing, as seen in the chemicals and IAS cases (Linke et al. 2016; Smolarz et al. 2016). Hence, despite ambitions to develop participation in environmental governance and recent developments of, for example, the RAC system in fisheries management, it can be concluded that regional structures and processes for stakeholder inclusion and deliberation generally remain rather undeveloped in BSR. Finally, there is an obvious lack of widely available supranational communication arenas in the Baltic Sea region, such as a common Baltic news media, which undermines effective environmental communication. Media coverage at the national level, on the other hand, is much more prominent, often making international coverage invisible (JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016). This is likely to obstruct opportunities for environmental governance of the Baltic Sea, since the possibility of stakeholders participating in regional societal debates is limited, as is the potential to develop a common regional understanding of environmental challenges and opportunities. In Table 10.3, we summarise the problems we have found to be important in the crosscase analysis, identify specific problem areas and give concrete examples that illuminate our findings better."

376,18,0.408,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","This book summarizes the current state of scientific and management knowledge regarding global rangelands and the major challenges that confront them. Current knowledge is assessed relative to changes that have occurred within rangeland ecology, management applications, and, more broadly, global events that have influenced rangelands. A widely accepted philosophical interpretation of scientific advancement notes that progress is often gradual and incremental as prevailing theories are explored and refined (Kuhn 1996). These periods of incremental progress, however, are periodically interrupted by major changes in underpinning theories that are termed scientific revolutions. This proved to be the case for range ecology and the discipline of ecology in the 1970s and 1980s when the prevailing theory of ecological equilibrium was challenged by a more dynamic nonequilibrium interpretation (Briske et al. 2003). Whether or not this represented a scientific revolution remains in dispute, but there is no question that it introduced a period of rapid conceptual change for the rangeland profession. Perhaps more pertinent to the goal of this book is that the development of this new knowledge broadly paralleled the progression of natural resource management models based on humanânatural resource interactions. These models are envisioned to sequentially progress with time following human settlement and societal development from humans as natural resource users to humans as natural resource stewards (Chapin et al. 2009). Consequently, changes in the perception of how humans interact with nature contribute to different knowledge needs and management strategies to maintain the supply of desired natural resources. Natural resource exploitation is an anticipated outcome following a long period of low-impact preindustrial human use (Fig. 1.1). Exploitation of US rangelands, prompted by the perception of limitless open-access resources, did occur in response to excessive livestock grazing in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This period of exploitation and subsequent natural resource degradation was termed the ârange problemâ in the southwest USA, and it directly contributed to development of the rangeland profession (Sayre et al. 2012; Sayre 2017). Exploitation was followed by development of steady-state management that attempts to maximize sustainable yield of specific goods that are most highly valued. This model is implemented through the control of ecosystem variationâfire suppression, predator control, and fencingâto optimize production of desired goods, on the basis of broad ecological principles that are administered through command and control management by various state or national agencies (Table 1.1). Recognition that effective management needed to consider entire ecosystems, including their inherent variation, and a societal demand for more diverse ecosystem services promoted development of the ecosystem management model. The ecosystem management modelâfocused on planning for integrated ecosystems as well as solicitation of more diverse stakeholder feedbackâoriginated in the 1970s and was"
284,64,0.407,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Conclusion A common element of Latin American environmentalist thought (absent in Europe and also in India, for example) is the awareness of the demographic disaster brought about by the European Conquest. This led to a perhaps justiï¬ed disdain for Malthusian approaches in the region. The environmentalism of Paul Ehrlich with his focus on the âpopulation bombâ was never successful in Latin America, where the population density is generally low (in comparison with Europe, East Asia and South Asia). Since the beginning of the 1970s, there has been a profound discussion among Latin American governments and on the part of the UNEP Regional Ofï¬ce to establish a shared environmental position. The 1972 Meadows Report, The Limits of Growth, garnered a general rejection in ofï¬cial circles in Latin America. It was emphasized that the problem was not the ï¬nite supply of resources but rather their distribution. However, 40 years after this debate, we have indeed found that today there are âplanetary boundariesâ of resources and sinks. Current world trends are negative in regard to the loss of biodiversity and climate change. Above and beyond this initial negative reaction in the 1970s and 1980s from ofï¬cial circles, and the search for a âLatin America agendaâ of its own, we have identiï¬ed a set of environmental ideas and practices that have emerged in Latin America and which in part coincide and in part diverge from other continents: â¢ awareness of the demographic disaster after the conquest and a widespread rejection of the Malthusian approach to the problem of overpopulation; â¢ an agroenvironmental pride, especially present in Mesoamerica and the Andes (and absent in the USA); â¢ a shared admiration by European and Latin American science (since 1800, with Alexander von Humboldt) for the great biological richness of the continent in its diverse ecosystems, together with conservation programmes implemented since the nineteenth century; â¢ a keen awareness of global political and economic inequality, and the consequent plundering of natural resources in the region; this"
233,13,0.407,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"During the last centuries and more dramatically in the last four decades, natural habitats were destroyed at rates much higher than ever observed in human history. All biomes were affected, but those located in tropical regions were more impacted, particularly because policies for the development and appropriation of these territories were emphasized during this period. Nonetheless, the massive transformation of these landscapes to give place to crops and towns multiplied speciesâ losses and vulnerability at incredible rates (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005), mostly due to the fact that most of worldâs biodiversity is concentrated around the tropics (Gaston 2000). In addition to habitat destruction and fragmentation, natural ecosystems were also submitted to high levels of pollution, overexploitation of forestry and ï¬shery resources, invasive species, and to the effects of climate changes mainly provoked by man-induced greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, a high number of species were already extinct and others have suffered severe populations declines (Mace et al. 2005), with many advancing at high speed to higher categories of threat every year (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2010). So, recent scenarios integrating main extinction drivers suggest that rates of extinction are likely to rise by at least a further order of magnitude over the next few centuries (Mace et al. 2005; Pereira et al. 2010; Barnosky et al. 2012; ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2013). This critical situation is now recognized as the âsixth mass extinctionâ, i.e. the sixth period in the history of life in which more than three-quarters of the living species is lost in a short geological interval (Barnosky et al. 2011). Compared to the ï¬rst âbig ï¬veâ, this extinction period has the peculiarity of being caused mainly by the way of living of one single species, the humans. Counteracting this trend is perhaps the biggest ethic, political and scientiï¬c challenge of our times (Sarkar 2005), as the time for action is short, funds for biodiversity conservation are far from below the real needs (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2012), uncertainties are enormous (Forest et al. 2015), and the solution of conï¬icts with main-trend ways-of-living and main patterns of distribution and consumption (e.g., Lenzen et al. 2012) often takes much longer than habitat destruction. In the race to combat extinctions, there is urgency for increasing conservation worldwide. The scientiï¬c community is pressed to provide criteria in order to deï¬ne priorities, as well as for indicating variables and standards that allows for monitoring the evolution of biodiversity in the light of these strategies (Hoffmann et al. 2010; Pereira et al. 2010, 2013; Mace et al. 2010, 2014). Traditionally, biodiversity conservation was based on species counts, valuing sites in terms of species richness, number of endemics and number of threatened species (Myers et al. 2000; Myers 2003; Kier et al. 2009). However, in spite of its generalized use, this kind of data can be very heterogeneous making very difï¬cult comparisons across taxonomic groups, along time and among sites, as species richness can be inï¬uenced by many factors, going from the species concept to the spatial scale and sampling effort (see Gaston 1996 for an overview on this subject). Similarly, in spite of the great interest of Red Lists of speciesâ threats, such as that from IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), to indicate imminent risks of extinction, concentrating conservation-limited resources on threatened species can be very risky and these limits must be considered (Possingham et al. 2002). Moreover, measures based on species counts also have the limitation of considering all species as equals, being"
182,278,0.407,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"In 2002 the US-based Association for Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine (AVEPM) co-organized a symposium in St. Louis, Missouri, to honour the lifetime achievements of Calvin W. Schwabe, who had served as professor of epidemiology in both the medical and veterinary schools of the University of California, Davis until his retirement in 1991.1 At the symposium, Schwabe gave a keynote address summarizing his ideas about how veterinary medicine should relate to other disciplinesâparticularly human medicineâand the wider world. Arguing against the compartmentalization of medicine by species, into human and veterinary strands, he used the opportunity to restate his longstanding arguments for a philosophy of One Medicine (OM), which sees veterinary medicine as a close collaborative partner with human medicine, working together towards the broader endeavours of healthcare and furthering knowledge in the life sciences.2 He claimed that this positioning reflected and recognized the contributions that veterinary medicine made to a range of other fields, including comparative zoology, parasitology, epidemiology, human public health, agriculture"

Following this, the public vaccination plan proposed by the government completely failed because the population did not accepted it. It is certain that these general practitioners played a role in this failure. This illustrates the power of the Internet and the way it changes state policy, that is, in our case, health policy. This also shows how the Internet affects the role of authorities, in particular scientific authorities. Lastly, this provides evidence of the crucial need for networked society, where institutions and organizations tend to collapse, of an epistemic responsibility like the one that is developed by Judith Simon, to ethically condemn the dissemination of wrong knowledge, as it was the case in the case above."

This path dependency and the resulting inertia of science and policymaking can also be seen in the chemicals case, where the traditional primacy of risk-based approaches (e.g. the âTDG machineâ) is strong. This phenomenon cannot be observed to an equal degree either in the case of eutrophication, where the NEST-HELCOM model offered a comparatively new approach of science-policy interaction, or in the emerging domain of IAS, where an institutionalised form of assessment-management interaction is not yet in place. Furthermore, well-developed institutional structures as they presently exist for EU fisheries management also seem to allow for the establishment of improved deliberative processes, which at least potentially could result in improved analysis of the socio-economic dimensions of the respective domain of marine governance (cf. Linke and Jentoft 2014; Urquhart et al. 2014). However, apart from an incremental âopening upâ of the linear science-policy structures in fisheries, we cannot find such tendencies developed to a similar extent for eutrophication, IAS, chemicals or oil transportation. In the cases of eutrophication, IAS and chemicals, it may also be substantially harder to identify clear groups of actors definable as âlegitimate stakeholdersâ to be included in the policy system than when one particular group of actors, for example, âresource usersâ (fishermen) or oil transporters (shipowners), can be defined as such and often accused of causing problems e.g. by the media. A rather clear identification of legitimate stakeholders, as we see in fisheries management, is not apparent in the cases of eutrophication (where farming only represents one of several important nutrient sources), chemicals (with a complex web of chemical producing and using actors), IAS or oil transportation. Regarding uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements, the observed assessmentmanagement interactions do not seem to adequately address the key challenges posed by the different states of knowledge as described in Fig. 8.2 and the sociopolitical ambiguities involved. With regard to management responses dealing with different forms of uncertainty and stakeholder conflicts, thorough analyses of the specific risk characteristics are not apparent, i.e. of the social and natural knowledge requirements or of the suitability of different management strategies such as a traditional science-based assessment, a precautionary approach, deliberative methods for stakeholder participation or extended peer review, etc. (see Sect. 8.2 and Fig. 8.2). Instead, all the studied assessment-management interactions can be classified as building primarily on traditional science-based assessments, which are then applied to policy- and decision-making (Table 8.1). We see, however, a number of ongoing changes and developments in each of the cases that illustrate adaptive responses to the key management challenges studied here. For example, we detect advancing processes of deliberation and stakeholder inclusion in both the science and management sector in the fisheries case, as an attempt to deal with the principal challenges posed by uncertainty in assessments and management, as well as to address conflicts of interests among the key actors. Concerning eutrophication, we can see similar challenges emerging (i.e. stakeholder"

9,20,0.406,"One Hundred Years of Chemical Warfare : Research, Deployment, Consequences","Abstract In the course of the First World War, scientists who would in peacetime generate new knowledge assumed the role of experts, i.e., professionals who made extant knowledge accessible to non-scientist clients. The deepest conviction of Fritz Haber, the 1918 Chemistry Nobel laureate, was that problems faced by mankind could be solved by means of science and technology. Herein, Haber is interpreted as a personiï¬cation of an early German expert culture. Acting as both mediator and organizer, Haber coaxed politicians, generals, industrial leaders, and scientists to join forces in developing new processes for the mass-production of war-relevant chemicals and in establishing large-scale industries for their manufacture. Among the chemicals produced were poison gasesâthe ï¬rst weapons of mass extermination. Haberâs leadership resulted in a conglomerate of enterprises similar to what we now call âbig scienceâ. In close contact with âbig industryâ, traditional science was transformed into a new type of applied research. With borderlines between the military and civilian use blurred, Fritz Haberâs activities also represent an early example of what we now call âdual useâ. He initiated modern pest control by toxic substances, whereby he made use of a military product for civilian purposes, but went also the other way around: During the Weimar era, he used pest control as a disguise for illegal military research. Having emerged under the stress of war, scientiï¬c expertise would remain ambivalentâa permanent legacy of the First World War."

Another aspect relevant to CIR is the organisational one, as it relates to the organisations and institutions that manage the physical components of the systems, i.e. CI operators or owners. It covers aspects such as culture, people, business continuity, risk, and disaster management at the organisational level. This more business-oriented aspect, which we have observed in the Australian national policy, serves as a way to gather all current business practices under one common goal: the operability of the infrastructure under adverse circumstances. The social dimension encompasses population and community characteristics that render social groups either more vulnerable or more adaptable to hazards and disasters. We observe that national resilience policies recently include, except of economic or even environmental aspects, social aspects in their deï¬nitions of resilience as CI are vital for maintaining key societal functions. These refer to the community and highlight how infrastructures contribute with essential services to it, e.g. as discussed in the aforementioned NIS Directive. Overall, a resilience-based approach for CI is an approach that is gradually adopted by nations in order to face the challenges and costs of achieving maximum protection in an increasingly complex environment and to overcome limitations of the traditional scenario-based risk management approach, where the organisation may lack capabilities to face risk from unknown or unforeseen threats and vulnerabilities."

10,373,0.403,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The interview campaigns held within the DROP project highlighted that the broad public is in general unaware of the risks and challenges water providers are facing due to drought. Users are accustomed to a high quality of service 24 h a day, 7 days a week; service interruption is seen as someone not having done his homework, rather than a possibility that can arise as a result of different natural risks to service provision. In addition, stakeholders highlighted that the broad public is typically unaware of the sources of their drinking water. In the Eifel-Rur region, for instance, the overall public perception is that the reservoirs provide other more visible services than drinking water, such as flood protection or opportunities for sailing and tourism attraction. This lack of awareness is a drawback when trying to communicate drought risks to the broader public (La Jeunesse et al. 2015). Communication on droughts faces additional challenges in these flood-prone regions. These highly visible impacting events convey to the broader public the idea that a certain regionâs problems are related to dealing with too much water, and not too little of it, as far as reservoirs are managed for protection against floods and also sustain stream flows during low-flows periods. Conveying the concept that flood risk does not imply an absence of drought risk is a communicational challenge. Awareness of the topic among stakeholder groups seems not much higher than that of the broader public. Stakeholders, in general, do not consider drought and water scarcity issue as urgent from their perspective, and there is a lot of interest in keeping up business as usual or even in expanding water uses. The exceptions to this rule are the drinking water providers themselvesâsome proof is given by the fact that the water boards IAV and WVER are part of the DROP project, and in Flanders drinking water providers also counted this issue as on their agenda. Beyond drinking water providers, some environmental authorities considered were showing interest in the issue, fundamentally due to the environmental problems that could derive of the low flows. Somewhat surprisingly, environmental NGOs in the"

97,80,0.402,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Nature is the basis for the production of food, clean water and fresh air; natural elements such as trees and other vegetation act as filter for air pollution and can reduce the risk of flooding by runoff retention and infiltration. Also, nature has significant influence on humans, for example by providing restorative settings, for educational purposes, offering inspiration and promoting creativity. The provision of these services to humans by nature has been captured in the concept of ESS. Thus, ESS is basically a categorization of the broad range of âbenefits people obtain from ecosystemsâ (MEA 2005:V). The concept emerged in the late 1970s when ecosystem functions beneficial to humans where termed as âservicesâ in order to raise public awareness for biodiversity conservation (GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. 2010). Since then, the literature on ecosystem services has strongly expanded, which has also led to a rich debate on the concept, with particular emphasis on methods for assessment and valuation of ecosystem services, but also addressing ethical issues and how the concept can be mainstreamed into policy making (e.g., Cowling et al. 2008, Thompson 2008, Norgaard 2010, Vierikko and Niemela 2016). The United Nations led Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report was a milestone with regard to the latter, as it represented the first ever global assessment of ecosystem services to policy makers."

Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable. This is due to various factors: x Production often in more exposed areas, e.g. disadvantaged and mountain regions, marginal land; x Shortage or lack of financial means to invest in risk-reducing measures, e.g. irrigation, drainage, frost prevention; x Limited access to loans; x Limited access to inputs to improve production techniques, which might have risk-reducing effects. The livestock sector is more exposed to epizootic diseases than to climatic risks. There is a high risk of epizootic disease outbreaks being spread over a wide area and consequently causing high economic losses. Prominent examples of such outbreaks are foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the United Kingdom in 20018 and in South Korea in 2010â2011,9 as well as avian influenza in Asia since 2003.10 Though such large loss events have relatively long recurrence periods, the loss potential is huge. In many developing economies,11 farmers retain the risk of crop losses and epizootic diseases irrespective of the size of their farms. Their risk management mainly consists of diversifying their income sources by planting a variety of crops and breeding cattle. They have hardly any risk-transfer tools, which in turn limits the availability and range of agricultural production finance offered by banks. This situation has not changed with the development of microfinance and microinsurance12 over the last decade. Thus, neither microfinance nor microinsurance have made their way into the area of agricultural production. Although"
110,260,0.402,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"x Production risk concerns variations in crop yields and in livestock production due to weather conditions, diseases, and pests; x Market risk is related to the variations in commodity prices and quantities that can be marketed; x Financial risk relates to the ability to pay bills when due, to have money to continue farming, and to avoid bankruptcy; x Legal and environmental risk concerns the possibility of lawsuits initiated by other businesses or individuals, and changes in government regulation related to environment; x Human resources risk concerns the possibility that family or employees will not be available to provide labor or management to the farming business. It is clear from the classification above that not all of the risks are specific to agriculture but that some are rather common to all businesses. This is true for most of the financial, legal, and human resources risks. Among the risks that affect agriculture more specifically are production risks (due to weather, pests, and diseases) as well as market and price risks. In recent years, climate change has appeared as a new phenomenon and risk category. Across the globe, it has a considerable influence on agricultural production and in some parts of the world has led to fundamental changes in production patterns and conditions. For the following discussion it is useful to differentiate between these principal (or common) risks and specific risks. Risks in Agricultural Finance Fundamentally, the risks in lending essentially hinge on the borrowerâs capacity and willingness to repay a loan, with the former depending on the viability of the business and the latter on the borrowerâs character. This is no different in agricultural lending. Here again, it is useful to differentiate between principal and specific risks. The risks in agricultural finance comprise to a considerable extent common risks associated with the viability of the farm business and the farmerâs character, not much different from the risks of micro and small businesses in other economic sectors. In addition, farm businesses are exposed to specific production and market risks that may affect their repayment capacity. Finally, given the strategic importance of agriculture for food security, agricultural finance is subject to political interference in many countries. This poses significant political risks to agricultural lending institutions since political interventions often turn out to be detrimental to lending to farmers. Hence, the following sections discuss these three categories: principal credit risks, specific risks related to agriculture, and political risks. 2.2 Principal Credit Risks Lending to small farmers exposes credit institutions to principal credit risks that are similar to those of micro and small enterprises in general. This is explained by"
38,234,0.402,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Box 6.1. Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) Under the leadership of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) has proposed to develop an integrated framework for sustained ocean observing based on Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs). An EOV, should have by deï¬nition, a high impact in responding to scientiï¬c and societal issues and a high feasibility of sustained observation. These will include biogeochemical and biological variables (ecosystem EOVs), to help understand marine ecosystems, in addition to the existing physical ocean variables. At the same time GEO BON has been developing the Essential Biodiversity Variables (Pereira et al. 2013). GOOS in collaboration with GEO BON, has established the GOOS Panel on Biology and Ecosystems (GOOS BioEco), which is responsible for the development and assessment of ecosystem EOVs. This includes documentation, best practice, readiness, implementation strategies, coordination of activities, and ï¬tness-of-purpose of data and information streams resulting from observations to improve their recommendations to policy-making. GOOS BioEco is also considering societal needs and human pressures affecting marine biodiversity and ecosystems to identify the EOVs. The ï¬rst GOOS Biology technical expert workshop in Townsville, Australia in November 2013, resulted in a preliminary list of 42 candidate ecosystem EOVs. From these, 10 were selected for high impact and feasibility within four major areas identiï¬ed as key for a healthy and productive ocean: (1) Productivity, (2) Biodiversity, (3) Ecosystem Services, and (4) Human activities and pressures. Some of the candidate EOVs that meet these requirements were chlorophyll, harmful algal blooms (HAB), zooplankton biomass and abundance, and the extent and live cover of marine communities such as coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes."
97,188,0.402,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Built and technical infrastructures continue to be viewed by local policy makers as the most important line of defense against hazards and disasters in cities. In much of the developed world, however, urban infrastructure is aging and proving inadequate for protecting city populations (for the US see ASCE 2013). And in much of the developing, rapidly urbanizing world, new infrastructure is being constructed at breath-taking pace, often without the benefit of ecologically based design (McHale et al. 2015; McPhearson et al. 2016b). Urban infrastructure mediates the relationships between human activities and ecosystem processes and may exacerbate or reduce human impact depending on its approach (McPhearson et al. 2016c). We suggest that a fundamental rethinking is urgently needed of what makes both grey and green built infrastructures â as well as human communities with their social, ecological, and technological couplings â resilient to environmental hazards and climate extremes. We argue that urban decision makers need to move beyond traditional engineering approaches and compliment stand-alone ecological interventions to consider how to utilize combined green-grey or hybrid approaches to advance CCA and DRR. Hybrid approaches are fundamentally ecosystem-based and take advantage of ecosystem functions together with the efficacy of more engineered systems to deliver the needed level of service. Examples such as using vegetation, porous surfaces, and temporary water storage in a combined hybrid approach to limit combined sewage overflows in New York City is a useful benchmark on how cities can transmit less water through the grey infrastructure drainage system to often overloaded wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, we suggest that viewing cities as interactive urban SETs can help to keep in mind the need for more combined approaches to dealing with climate driven hazards and improve urban sustainability. The SETs framework offers the fundamental concept that urban systems and all urban services have a combination of all three domains (social, ecological, and technical-infrastructural) as part of their production, dynamics, and efficacy."
73,768,0.401,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Economic growth is considered to be essential to modern societies. Its imperatives permeate political debate, economic development, public and social media, and commerce. Greater wealth drives more resource consumption. This is reï¬ected in the demand for technology, urban water, meat, or exotic plant-based food, all of which have a substantial footprint (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2014), along with food waste and or the expansion of urban areas. Whilst it is argued that with dematerialisation of the economy less natural resources can create greater wealth, the degree to which this is possible is uncertain (Weizsacker et al. 1998). The natural resource governance system drives resource consumption more effectively than it supports conservation and restoration. Nowhere is this more obvious than with the conversion of farmland and undeveloped green spaces into peri-urban uses. Harmful invasive species include plants (âweedsâ), animals, insects, diseases and other living beings that harm human and ecological interests. They invade ecosystem types from oceans to mountains (Global Invasive Species Database, http:// issg.org/database/species/search.asp). Weeds invade domestic gardens and farmlands, and can trigger dangerous allergies. Rodents destroy standing or stored produce, contaminate products or spread disease; wild dogs, feral pigs and other pest animals spread human or animal diseases; marine invasive species contaminate water and damage ï¬sheries; mosquitos spread serious disease â the list of economic, social and environmental impacts of invasive species is daunting. Particularly in urban and peri-urban environments the role of pest animals as vectors of disease adds a health risk to this problem. Adding biodiversity loss caused by pest species to this list, and the problem of harmful invasive species in peri-urban areas comes into focus as signiï¬cant in many parts of the world. Australia reports 166 agricultural invasive species from a total of 409 invasive species. For urban invasive pests, Australia reports 154 with many of these occurring in urban, rural and peri-urban settings. Riverine and marine invasive species also impact on urban interests, such as water quality, marine foods and recreational use. Insects impact upon lifestyle and spread disease. Invasive vertebrate pests, particularly foxes, wild dogs, feral cats, rabbits and feral pigs cause much economic damage. Feral pigs cause losses to sugar cane and bananas in north Queensland while rabbits ring-bark trees and shrubs and prevent regeneration, contributing to poor land condition. These invasive vertebrates collectively generate an agricultural cost exceeding $A1b per year: Rabbits cost $206 million per year, wild dogs, $48.5 million per year, foxes, $21.2 million per year, and feral pigs, $100 million per year (Gong et al. 2008). Invasive animals also have a substantial ecological impact (Roberts et al. 2013). In New South Wales they are implicated in 40 % of the threatened biodiversity, threatening 388 native species that constitute 83 % of endangered animal populations and 38 % of endangered ecological communities. Rabbits impact 156 threatened species, wild dogs and foxes impact 76 threatened species and feral pigs more than 20 threatened species. Feral pigs prey on as much as 70 % of sea turtle nests in north Queensland, foxes are signiï¬cant predators of a wide range of native fauna"

These are âimplementation of new climate diagnostic products, multiple talks and articles for non-scientific audiences, and various tailor-made instructional efforts (e.g., workshops on the fundamentals of decision-making)â. The participants of the projects agree that the intense interdisciplinary collaboration, especially with the involvement of stakeholders (transdisciplinary approach, to be described below), can be very demanding and energyconsuming, starting with the common formulation of a problem, choosing crossdisciplinary methods to be used in research, formation of a team and others. The obstacles stem from differences in âstyles of thought, research traditions, techniques and languageâ of involved actors. However, despite the difficulties, the interdisciplinary approach facilitates in keeping a systemic view and looking at problems from a range of perspectives. moreâhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j. envsci.2012.07.008. Finally, transdisciplinarity broadens a researchâs scope into another study dimension as beside the orientation towards real-life problems; this approach also seeks to integrate lay or non-academic knowledge with scientific one. This understanding is expressed in the definition of Lang et al. (2012, p. 27) where âtransdisciplinarity is a reflexive, integrative, method-driven scientific principle aiming at the solution or transition of societal problems and concurrently of related scientific problems by differentiating and integrating knowledge from various scientific and societal bodies of knowledgeâ."

391,837,0.4,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"Why a chapter on Perspectives and Integration in SOLAS Science in this book? SOLAS science by its nature deals with interactions that occur: across a wide spectrum of time and space scales, involve gases and particles, between the ocean and the atmosphere, across many disciplines including chemistry, biology, optics, physics, mathematics, computing, socio-economics and consequently interactions between many different scientists and across scientific generations. This chapter provides a guide through the remarkable diversity of cross-cutting approaches and tools in the gigantic puzzle of the SOLAS realm. Here we overview the existing prime components of atmospheric and oceanic observing systems, with the acquisition of oceanâatmosphere observables either from in situ or from satellites, the rich hierarchy of models to test our knowledge of Earth System functioning, and the tremendous efforts accomplished over the last decade within the COST Action 735 and SOLAS Integration project frameworks to understand, as best we can, the current physical and biogeochemical state of the atmosphere and ocean commons. A few SOLAS integrative studies illustrate the full meaning of interactions, paving the way for even tighter connections between thematic fields. Ultimately, SOLAS research will also develop with an enhanced consideration of societal demand while preserving fundamental research coherency."
169,792,0.4,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"reasons why ï¬sheries became unproductive and might remain so may originate from a range of sources both natural and social. To identify and explore the barriers and bridges to that integration, a range of social and systems sciences were applied to examine the effectiveness of ârepublican,â e.g., national, based on the French system, and traditional forms of governance and the potential to harmonize them. In addition, exercises in scenario development allowed managers and planners to explore potential paths of policy development. Finally, conceptual modeling afforded a systems analysis of the ecological, economic, and social factors that can individually or by interaction create opportunities or barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries management. The results were used to make recommendations for ï¬sh and water policies, in education (universities and governmental agricultural professional schools), and will have practical relevance for food security and health care (Melcher et al. 2013; Ouedraogo et al. 2014; Sendzimir et al. 2015). This chapter pursues the central question of the SUSFISH project, e.g., what is the long-term potential to establish sustainable ï¬sheries and aquatic ecosystems on which they depend in BF? SUSFISH embraced this question as a challenge wider than simply transferring the technical means to monitor ï¬sheries but in instilling and awakening a culture of healthy ï¬sheries that is broadly supported across Burkinabe society as well as in government policy. We begin by describing the scientiï¬c advances that the project used in application to establish bioindicators and monitoring methods as the technical base of ï¬sheries management. We then consider the many factors, biophysical as well as economic, political, and cultural, which potentially can inï¬uence the trajectory of Burkinabe ï¬sheries toward sustainability. We conclude with recommendations based on lessons learned."
132,275,0.4,AiREAS: Sustainocracy for a Healthy City: Phase 3: Civilian Participation â Including the Global Health Deal Proposition,"Human health and a healthy environment should be the factors steering socio-economic development by government and business. Right now, this is insufï¬ciently the case, with very serious and in essence avoidable consequences for the human being and our natural environment, including the sustainability of our (economic) productivity. In fact, at an executive level, policy choices are being made within the context of a largely obsolete socio-economic agenda that sustains or even produces undesirable situations of degraded health. At the same time, both pollution and illness is being economized through unnecessary and expensive bureaucratic systems. We can determine that there is a vicious circle of ï¬nancial burdens, resulting in the local and global elimination of our environment and health, which has reached unsustainable proportions with extremely destructive consequences for current and future generations. The need for a drastic review of our socio-economic agenda, in which we primarily consider our own initiative and responsibility as civilians in our own society for our core values, is therefore extremely urgent. Through the Global Health Deal, with the precedent of the regional Brabants Health Deal in the Netherlands, together with the local build-up of expertise through iconic initiatives such as AiREAS and others resonating with health, the executive level is offered a choice: become part of the creative solution or remain among those who cause the problems?"
197,41,0.4,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"energy vulnerability itself remains poorly theorized. Recent energy vulnerability scholarshipâwhose detailed consideration would extend beyond the confines of this chapterâhas emphasized the importance of considering the problem through a spatial and temporal framework, while discussing its social construction and the need to consider why and how a given entity may become or be considered vulnerable (Christmann, Ibert, Kilper, & Moss, 2012; Philo, 2012; Waite, Valentine, & Lewis, 2014). Energy vulnerability has been used in a very wide range of contexts, as it can refer to the infrastructural determinants of resource supply and import dependence at a variety of scales, as well as the systemic conditions that allow some entities to become more socially and technically precarious than others (Christie, 2009; Hall et al., 2013; Hiteva, 2013). There is a distinctive literature on household energy vulnerability, understood as a set of circumstances that underpin the risk of falling into fuel and energy poverty. Having applied Spiersâ (2000) understanding of âemicâ vulnerability to utility services such as heating and cooling, Middlemiss and Gillard (2015) suggest that energy vulnerability can also be articulated via a bottom-up perspective that characterizes experiences of deprivation. The material embeddedness of energy vulnerability points to the need for considering the condition though a geographical lens. In the remainder of this book, I consider energy vulnerability as a âsocio-spatial formationâ situated at the nexus of political decisions, economic inequalities, organizational practices, on the one hand, and the physical features of place and space, on the other. It should be noted that socio-spatial formations have been theorized extensively in the geography literature, although this body of work has rarely been considered the agency of infrastructural systems. Initial use of the term was motivated by the need for exploring how the political and economic shifts associated with globalization gave rise to specific development patterns and practices of contestation at the urban scale (Amin, 1994). More recent work on the topic has drawn upon regulation theory approaches to emphasize the institutional and political reconfigurations that have underpinned the emergence of entrepreneurial urbanism and the move from âgovernment to governanceâ (Mcguirk, 2012). At the same time, assemblage thinking has allowed for socio-spatial formations to be considered as heterogeneous and emergent networks involving the interaction of human and non-human entities via a range of distributed agencies (Anderson & McFarlane, 2011; Dittmer, 2013)."

378,5,0.398,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"The twenty-ï¬rst century is an age of radical change. It presents us with challenges of a new dimension, scale and scope. The transformation challenge of the twentieth century was seen as one of primarily socioeconomic dynamics with nation states being the central actors. We are now facing a situation where we are aware of planetary ecological boundaries and the global nature of the transformation ahead. Recognizing the urgency and magnitude of this challenge, the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) argues in its 2011 flagship report that we need a âGreat Transformationâ. Referring to Karl Polanyiâs work, it creates a realistic vision for the twenty-ï¬rst century of a good life for 9 billion people within planetary boundaries, that is, if we manage to accomplish a great transformation. What we need, if we want to make this vision a real option for the future, are concepts that capture the complex nature of intertwined ecological, social, economic and technological transformation processes for sustainable development. The concepts need to offer guidance and orientation to the people that are actually engaged in the transformation process. Over the past 15 years, scientists have developed approaches for âtransition managementâ to meet these challenges. Many of these approaches, originating from a diverse set of scientiï¬c communitiesâas portrayed in this bookâfocus on greening the economy, fostering (technological) innovation, searching for new modes of governance and understanding the dynamic relationship between established âregimesâ and pioneers working towards new system architectures. However, most of the scientiï¬c frameworks for sustainability transitions and transformation research remain limited in one key aspect: not reflecting on how deeply embedded the capitalist economic logic has become in organizing societies. For a more adequate conceptualization of the âGreat Transformationâ, we need a"
143,362,0.398,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"because these are the actors who know about the unique challenges and enablers present in the ecosystem (Isenberg 2010, 2011; Vogel, 2013). As this chapter has shown, taking a holistic and multidimensional ecosystem perspective requires decision-makers to account for hundreds of different factors. This can only be achieved through intense and ongoing exchanges with ecosystem stakeholders from the respective dimensions. The need for such bottom-up information and co-design of policies is especially pivotal in resource-scarce contexts, where a lack of knowledge of approaches that work in such contexts might tempt policymakers to copy generic policy prescriptions that âworked in the West.â In Kenya, many achievements in kickstarting the ecosystem were driven by practitioners themselves, who took the initiative to open technology hubs and other support institutions. Such stakeholders are an invaluable resource because they already have a good overview of the ecosystem. Policymakers therefore need to put processes in place that enable the engagement of practitioners in the design and continuous refinement of their ecosystem-fostering strategy. Examples for such processes include establishing an open-door culture for ecosystem participants to talk with policymakers as well as regular fixed-day meetings and roundtable discussions that bring together experts from all ecosystem dimensions. Once such processes are in place, policymakers can start launching ongoing rounds of intervention and feedback that facilitate the emergence of an environment that breeds high-growth technology entrepreneurship. 5. Anticipate the challenges and prepare to meet them A dynamic perspective acknowledges that ecosystems face different challenges at different phases and enables participants to prepare for what is coming next. Two challenges that nascent ecosystems may encounter on the way to maturation have emerged. First, the suggested early empowerment of a private sector enterprise to build embryonic telecommunication market structures may later lead to the presence of a powerful incumbent that stifles competition and entrepreneurial efforts. Policymakers should address this from the start, when, for example, negotiating licenses with such a corporation, and find ways to encourage the incumbent to interact with the ecosystem at later stages (also see GSMA 2014). Second, the inflow of foreign ecosystem participants leads to a culturally very diverse entrepreneurship scene. The research presented"

192,230,0.397,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"As a researcher, Martin is torn between the profane world of everyday existence and the sacred realm of science. The normal world is depicted in a cynical and sarcastic manner. Only heavy drinking allows the hero to survive the imperfections of love, marriage and human company, where real-life people oftentimes prove disappointing and abusive. Only in the realm of pure science can Martin hope to find purity and precision (integrity), instead of sloppiness and contamination (questionable practices or even misconduct). These two realms compare to one another as newspapers and popular magazines compare to the Journal of Infectious Diseases. But the scientific realm is not an innocent world. For here, the death drive reigns: Martin studies bugs in order to systematically eradicate them (to destroy these âamiableâ pathogenic germs, with their âlovely flagellaâ, p. 41), while staggering numbers of test animals (rabbits and guinea pigs) are âsacrificedâ on behalf of (often quite pointless) research, without any ethical review procedure whatsoever. At a certain point, Martin even starts using chimpanzees for a 2 year project that ends in failure, although âmurdering monkeys proves expensive and grimâ (p. 440).

Adaptation of conservation management means adjustments in management practices, decision-making processes and organisational structures (Welch 2005). Although the adaptation process should be started now, it must be planned as a long term process. It will be successful only if as many institutions and stakeholders as possible are actively involved and are willing to support it. Scientists have an important role to play in the development of adaptation strategies, but to facilitate effective implementation of adaptation actions local communities and decision-makers are essential. Expertise and data provided by research are a basis for a transparent and understandable decision-making process, but scientific results need to be translated and presented in a form that is accessible to professionals and decision-makers and local stakeholders (Welch 2005). The scientific information for local climate adaptation must be relevant for the decision at hand and tailored for the decision context. It should be authorised and trusted by the people affected, and transparent in the process of production. Meeting and addressing the needs, knowledge and language of local communities who have to implement adapted management practices is a major challenge for many scientists in climate impact research. Acknowledging this challenge, the project HABIT-CHANGE initiated a science-management approach to plan jointly for adaptation in protected areas. This kind of collaborative research has already produced beneficial results in other areas (Littell et al. 2012; Lonsdale and Goldthorpe 2012). The science-practice partnership for collaborative research proved to be invaluable for testing useful methods, the identification of applicable solutions and the enhancement of practical conservation management within HABIT-CHANGE. It was built on an intensive dialogue between an interdisciplinary panel of scientists and local management and facilitates the co-production of knowledge. In this process several barriers to the practical implementation of theoretical concepts were identified. Much data and many methods provided by science did not fit with planning reality and the decision context of protected area management. On the other hand, many management practices were lacking a foundation in solid facts and evaluation of their success was often neglected. Furthermore, it seems that much of the available knowledge and guidance on adaptation of conservation management does not reach local management. From the experience gained in the project we could see that climate change is rarely perceived and accepted as a high priority challenge on site level. There is often too little awareness that climate change is already a main driver of biodiversity loss and that its significance will increase even more in the future. Usually, neither management authorities nor land users and stakeholders have enough information, knowledge or incentives to plan and negotiate necessary adaptations to climate change. The adaptive capacity of local institutions like the administrations of National Parks or Biosphere Reserves is a crucial component too. The lack of expertise, methods and tools for climate adaptation as well as limited resources prevents proper management and adaptation (Fig. 20.1). The institutional setting of protected areas influences capacity and willingness to respond to new challenges"

However, resilience has also been used as a concept within planning processes and adaptive management exercises (Roux and Foxcroft 2011; Namoi CMA 2013). Resilience can be understood as a systemâs capacity to â. . . retain its basic function and structure by absorbing the impact of disturbance and/or recovering and rebuilding post-disturbanceâ (Namoi CMA 2013). Such a deï¬nition is too general to measure precisely (Cabell and Oelofse 2012). A very wide diversity of variables has been used not as direct measurements but as indicators of separate factors that individually and collectively contribute to this capacity in different contexts. Social science applications have assessed various human capacities to cope or adapt in the face of shock or stress as indicators of resilience. These capacities have been variously deï¬ned in terms of robustness and vulnerability (Pasteur 2011; Barrett and Constas 2014),"
38,17,0.396,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"remains inadequate to address the emerging challenges to biodiversity, human development and planetary management (Costello et al. 2013d). It is well known that biodiversity is in world-wide decline (Butchart et al. 2010 summarises recent evidence). This impoverishment takes the form of local and global extinctions, but also more pervasive and subtle simpliï¬cation, hollowing-out and dominance by a few species of formerly complex, abundant and equitable ecosystems (e.g., see Pereira et al. 2012). The resources of the Earthâland, oceans, water, primary productivity and nutrientsâare increasingly appropriated by humans and their client species (Haberl et al. 2007). The process of human domination has been underway for nearly ten thousand years, ever since the domestication of crops and livestock, but has accelerated over the past century or two. It has reached such proportions that we have entered the âAnthropoceneââthe era when human actions are the dominant Earth-shaping force (Crutzen 2002). There is little doubt that the current and projected rate of biodiversity loss exceeds its rate of generation. As a result, the world is getting poorer in terms of the biological variation it supports. The loss of biodiversity has well-established immediate causes: the loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat needed for the completion of life histories; over-harvesting of organisms which have commercial value (and the collateral damage to other organisms and ecosystems in the process); pollution of the environment by biocides and the waste products of human activity; and competition, predation or infection by invasive alien species deliberately or inadvertently introduced from other parts of the world are the leading causes (SCBD 2010). Climate change during the 21st century is projected to be high up on this list of the causes for biodiversity loss. The contemporary decline in diversity is not entirely without precedent. On at least ï¬ve previous occasions in the approximately ï¬ve billion year history of this living planet, biodiversity has undergone relatively abrupt decreases (Leakey and Lewin 1995). In some cases, this has been the result of the rise to dominance of a new group of organisms, such as the evolution of oxygen-generating algae three billion years ago, which conï¬ned the previously dominant anaerobic bacteria to low-oxygen niches. In other cases, it is attributed to cataclysmic events such as the impact of an asteroid. Although previous episodes of biodiversity loss have left a lasting imprint on the biota of the world, biodiversity overall has always recovered, often in different forms. Disruption of the old order may even have been the stimulus for biological innovation. For instance, the end of domination by dinosaurs may have allowed a relatively obscure group of proto-mammals to evolve, ultimately, into our own species. Why then are we concerned about the current loss of diversity? First, the current loss of biodiversity is just one element of an interconnected syndrome known as âGlobal Changeâ. Another element is climate change, mostly driven by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and release of other waste gases. A key driver of both climate change and biodiversity loss is the ongoing transformation of the surface of the planet due to human activities, including agriculture, deforestation, settlements, transport infrastructure, ï¬shing and"

In particular, the need to mainstream ecosystem- or nature-based solutions into urban governance and planning is widely advocated by both academic and governmental bodies. Adaptation mainstreaming is the inclusion of climate risk considerations in sector policy and practice. It is motivated by the need to challenge common ideas, attitudes, or activities and change dominant paradigms at multiple levels of governance.

In many cases the omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Martinez-Alier 2001; Nagarajan and Thiyageasan 2006; Varela 2001). The unavoidability of feedbacks between largely structural and technical interventions and the socio-economic systems within which they are embedded, highlights the need for employing more systematic (or ecosystem) approaches to analyse cause and effect relationships and to explore future sustainable, efï¬cient and equitable development scenarios (Hopkins et al. 2011; Belton and Bush 2014). This raises the question, what processes are needed to include issues and concerns that are not currently promoted by active and resourceful stakeholders (Buanes et al. 2004). This is especially important in offshore areas under multi-use conditions, since this is a novel line of resource use which lacks yet experiences on which stakeholder groupâs work well together under which governance and management conditions and what type of socio-economic outcomes can be expected. Indeed, more detailed and context-speciï¬c socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture operations include many important factors which need to be understood: gender, employment and income, nutrition, food security, health, insurance, credit availability, human rights, legal security, privatization, culture/identity, global trade and inequalities, as well as policies, laws and regulations, macro-economic context, political context, customary rules and systems, stakeholders, knowledge and attitudes, ethics, power, markets, capital and ownership (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Certainly, the lack of consensus on the social dimension is striking when compared with the universally accepted general deï¬nitions that exist for the biological and economic dimensions for sustainable ecosystem management (Krause et al. 2015). This is even more so the case of offshore marine management. Based on the existing literature from coastal aquaculture (see references below) we identify these major types of socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture which are universally applicable: (a) Attitudes to and perceptions of aquaculture and its effects (b) Organization of and participation in planning for aquaculture (c) Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution (d) Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests (e) Effects on the wider economic and innovation system (f) Effects on cultural fabric and other social aspects As the list indicates, the social implications of aquaculture are multi-dimensional and affect multiple levels. As a starting point of this analysis, we capture what we account as social dimension by stating what aspects of aquaculture we have excluded: The internal organization and efï¬ciency of the aquaculture production units, and the ecological effects of aquaculture production (including biological,"

An outbreak of bubonic plague in the Lesser Antilles provides him with a perfect opportunity to test his phage in vivo. His motives are scientific rather than medical, however, and he sets off on an expedition which is not meant to save lives, but rather to produce a landmark publication. He wants to use humans instrumentally, in order to understand the phage. For him, human beings (coloured, illiterate inhabitants of a Caribbean island) are living test-tubes as it were. So far, the bacteriophage had been a laboratory artefact. Time had come to test his principle X in an outdoor setting, exposing it to the reality principle as it were. Bacterial viruses were still untried in the real world outside the lab. Will the vaccine work in the messy and complex environment called reality? The inhabitants of St. Hubert are seen as research subjects rather than suffering patients. The population of a remote village (providing optimal conditions for a field trial) is divided into two samples: the experimental condition (receiving the phage vaccine) and the control group (denied the lifeâsaving serum and treated with traditional methods) â a strategy which Pasteur and his followers had successfully adopted in their experiments with cattle (Zwart 2008a, p 175 ff.).22 Indeed, the experiment (purportedly conducted for the benefit of mankind, but primarily designed for the prestige of McGurk) is performed by Americans at the expense of coloured, native human âbodiesâ (Lynch 2000). But as the phage vaccine begins to show results, it becomes increasingly difficult to uphold the experimental design in practice.

Today technologies and the development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow us to easily demonstrate simple geographic spatial relationships and to analyze more complex ones. Mapping and GIS were applied here to illustrate spatial dimensions of marginality at continental and regional levels. We hereby sought to make the marginalized and poor more visible by identifying areas where many poor people live under difficult biophysical and socio-economic conditions. A broad set of variables covering ecological, social and economic dimensions were identified for this purpose and we used existing datasets to describe each variable in the first step of our marginality mapping approach. We focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA), where most of the worldâs poor, and in particular the poorest, live (Ahmed et al. 2007; von Braun et al. 2009). The number of extremely poor and hungry people remains unacceptably high. Being excluded from economic growth and other dimensions of societal development are indications of the extreme poor existing at the margins of society, which may trigger a downward spiral into poverty (Gatzweiler et al. 2011). Marginality is frequently cited as a root cause of poverty (von Braun et al. 2009) and is a complex issue that is not amenable to simple solutions or answers. It may be defined as: an involuntary position and condition of an individual or group at the margins of social, political, economic, ecological and biophysical systems, preventing them from access to resources, assets, services, restraining freedom of choice, preventing the development of capabilities, and eventually causing extreme poverty (Gatzweiler et al. 2011, 3)."

Ultimately, of course, there are limits to the extent that scientific language can shift the boundaries of its own meaning. The difficult course between precision and adaptability is navigated over and over again, as societyâs needs also change. Circumstances alter; culture reinvents itself. The challenge for science is to respond to those changes. History is almost as replete with defunct disciplines, which failed in that task, as ecology is of extinct species. In the long run, perhaps, the arbiter of success is not longevity, but usefulness. To have survived and thrived for over 25 years is of course a remarkable achievement. But what really counts is the light that industrial ecology has shed on some of the most pressing issues of our time. This volume is a fitting testament to that success. Guildford, Surrey, UK"

The chapter highlights the importance of engaging users of research in the development of impact pathways and continuously throughout the life of the program. Results show that partnerships with diverse actors such as the private sector and policy makers are key to achieving change. The chapter concludes that research alone is insufficient to bring about change. However, research does generate knowledge that stakeholders can put to use to generate development outcomes. Chapter 5 by Monika Egger Kissling and Roman Windisch, âLessons from taking stock on 12 years of Swiss international cooperation on climate changeâ highlights the challenges encountered and lessons learned from this assessment where a bilateral donor puts climate change lens on a longstanding development cooperation portfolio. The chapter discusses the need (1) for evaluators to put more effort in identifying best methodological practices amidst a large volume of information, diverse portfolio and absence of reliable data; (2) for practitioners to invest more in strategic project design and monitoring to provide accurate data; and (3) for policy makers to be cognizant of the value that evaluation brings, as it is an important tool that contributes to accountability. Chapter 6 by Michael Carbon discusses the approach, process and lessons from the evaluation of UNEPâs Climate Change Sub-programme. It shows the importance of developing an appropriate analytical framework that is well-suited for the scope and complexity of the object of evaluation, and how the Theory of Change approach helped make a credible assessment of UNEPâs contribution towards impact, sustainability and upscaling. Chapter 7 written by Aryanie Amellina focuses on an assessment of the initial phases of the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) in Indonesia.

Mahr argued that veterinarians should adopt OH. Through building partnerships with public and environmental health professionals, they should assume leading roles in meeting these challengesâand growing the profession along the way.64 Over the following year, he gained the support of his counterpart at the American Medical Association (AMA), public health physician Ronald M. Davis, who had pre-existing concerns about the risks that zoonotic diseases pose to humans. While this alliance resulted in OH being endorsed by the AMA in 2007, Davis died of cancer the following year and the resolution was subsequently dropped, indicating that the US medical profession more widely did not share his enthusiasm for OH.65 Mahr was more successful in persuading his colleagues in the AVMA, who passed their own resolution supporting OH. They also established a One Health Commission to investigate ways of improving veterinarymedical collaborations and moving the agenda forward, chaired by Lonnie King, one of the 2002 Schwabe symposium contributors. In parallel, Laura Kahn, Thomas Monath and Bruce Kaplan formed the One Health Initiative, an unfunded advocacy group dedicated to making the case for OH. Kahn is a physician based at Princeton University who by 2006 was already working on biosecurity and the risks of pandemic disease.66 Kaplan had worked on food-borne illnesses for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before his retirement, and Monath is a physician and consultant working in the pharmaceutical industry.67 The OH Initiative quickly launched a website and organized a series of meetings and publications on OH/OM, including a piece entitled âConfronting Zoonosesâ co-authored by Kahn and Kaplan with veterinary public health pioneer James H.

While authors award animals key roles as transmitters of infectious diseases, they also present them as charismatic wildlife that need to be protected from disease; or, in the case of livestock animals, as potential food for humans whose productivity (like that of the cows discussed in Chapter 4) must be safeguarded and promoted. While the WCS veterinariansâ ultimate priority was (in line with their institutional orientation) the protection and preservation of wildlife, the version of OH that they fashioned argues that this is best pursued through means that jointly protect human, animal and ecological health, for the benefit of all species. While drawing heavily on older ideas about OM, by broadening the scope from medicine to health, and bringing in the idea of care for ecosystems and wildlife alongside livestock and humans, it decentred humans significantly. 6.1.3"
320,124,0.395,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"between the kind of information models can provide and what managers of natural areas need. The perception of models differs between disciplines and between science and practice. Models range from semantic descriptions of assumed interrelations to computer based mathematical models; the term âmodelâ is often used for computer based models only. During recent decades, model-based prediction of biological responses to climate change has become a very active field of research. In the field of climate change modelling, models primarily enable understanding of global climate cycles. The development of models could demonstrate the impact of human activities on the earth climate system. Models serve to structure knowledge, to formulate hypotheses and to illustrate future developments. In the field of nature conservation management, the development of alternative scenarios is of special interest. Different management options may lead to different futures. Ex-ante assessment of the outcome of specific management measures in conjunction with different climate change impact scenarios may support management â but may also lead to deep frustration because of the high degree of uncertainty about future developments. Especially the necessary combination of different model types, such as climate models, vegetation models, and hydrological models, including all their underlying assumptions and uncertainties, renders it difficult for managers to identify useful options for decision making. Even though there have been extensive studies to model the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, the results are still sobering. In 2002 the IPCC found that âmost models of ecosystem changes are not well suited to projecting changes in regional biodiversityâ (IPCC 2002: 15). More and more authors have picked up this critical attitude towards the modelling of climate effects (e.g. Biesbroek et al. 2009; Opdam et al. 2009; Pyke et al. 2007). After a far-reaching survey of literature on conservation issues, Heller and Zavaleta (2009) concluded that âmany articles based on concrete modeling work or empirical studies of species responses to climate change tended either to not elaborate their results to management directives, or to present recommendations in vague terms such as, ârestoration should be consideredââ (Heller and Zavaleta 2009: 17). Therefore, Heller and Zavaleta highlighted the need to pay more attention of transferring modelling results into the decision context of management issues (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). This problem is not only limited to conservation management but to adaptation to climate change in general (Millner 2012). In this chapter we are describing concrete model approaches used to support decision-making within the HABIT-CHANGE project context. Facing climate change, climate impact models are currently seen as a big support for the development of alternative management scenarios. Handling uncertainties and understanding the âmodel cascadeâ will help in judging where models will supply useful information. A short overview of model approaches and their assumptions is presented as a basis for adaptive management and their benefits as well as limitations are discussed."
198,6,0.395,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Climate change is one of the preeminent challenges facing the world today. The consequences of climate change manifest themselves in multiple ways, including increased variability and intensity of extreme weather events and sea level rise. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and the first ones to feel them tend to be poor people and poor countries that are most vulnerable and have the least capacities to cope with them. The search for solutions to mitigate climate change and to adapt to its consequences is urgent. Rigorous evaluation of policies, programs, and projects can help the international community to identify technical solutions, economic strategies, and social innovations that improve our ability to deal with climate change. This is the focus of the present book. The book has its genesis in the Climate-Eval Community of Practice hosted by the Independent Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility. Its overarching goal is to establish standards and norms, support capacity development, and share good practices in evaluations of climate change and development. In November 2014, Climate-Eval with its partners organized the Second International Conference on Evaluating Climate Change and Development in Washington, D.C. The aim of this event was to promote an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and methods to evaluate climate change and sustainable development. This 3-day event brought together some 300 leading experts and policymakers in the field and included sessions on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and policy, as well as special sessions such as panel discussions and roundtables. Topics discussed ranged from theory of change approaches to evaluation and institutional capacity; to disaster risk reduction, resilience, and tracking adaptation; to monitoring and evaluation of ecosystem-based and natural resource management interventions and climate change funds. Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development builds upon a selection of the most relevant and practical papers and presentations given at the 2014 conference. Following the conference, the editors and the authors worked closely together to develop the presentations into a coherent set of articles organized around the three main themes of climate change evaluation: policy,"

370,133,0.395,Investigating the Body in the Victorian Asylum,"would in any case be turned out in the event that they became unruly.32 The excitement, delusions, or physical inï¬rmities of asylum patients, on the other hand, could account for a wide range of events, with apparently inexplicable injuries rationalised by attributing them to dysfunctional behaviour. Though an accident traditionally implied no human agency, changing understandings of the accident blurred the boundaries between accident and intentional act. âAccidentsâ coalesced to form a body of cases that were explained in the press as events neatly attributable to an inefï¬cient and immoral asylum system. The broken rib scandal occurred at a time when âaccidents went public,â both in terms of the arena in which they occurred and in terms of rising public concern for safety.33 Both Roger Cooter and Jamie Bronstein have emphasised the penchant of the Victorian press for the large-scale accident such as the mining disaster.34 Generally âit was the somewhat atypical âsingle event catastropheâ that captured newspaper attention,â or shock epidemic diseases like cholera.35 However, in the case of factories and workshops, individual cases could also be crucial in raising public awareness of the need for preventative measures such as safety railings or breathing respirators. Stories of individual asylum deaths like Rees Priceâs carried within them a distinct thread of humanitarian concern and tapped into contemporary fears about the medical profession. The broken rib scandal was reminiscent, for example, of fears surrounding âchloroform deathsâ (patients dying whilst under sedation) in the 1840s and 1850s.36 Whilst it was not until 1885 that the BMJ felt it appropriate to comment on factory accidentsâ and even then in a manner which suggested such things were private mattersâit published a lengthy list of stories from the 1870s that dealt with the âasylum problem.â37 Yet ofï¬cial statistics suggested that broken ribs in asylums were not as common as many supposed: the Blue Book of 1896 recorded 7182 deaths in English and Welsh asylums that year, 11 of which were a result of fractures or dislocations.38 Some speculated that incidences of fracture were less common in asylums due to extra precautionary measures, whilst others cited increased inspection as the reason for deaths coming to public attention.39 The recording of accidental injury was indeed increasing at this time and just as we may read slightly sensationalist accounts of broken ribs as evidence of a widespread phenomenon, we may also read the reports as representative of a few isolated casesâas Edward Baines observed of the cotton industry in the 1830s, where singular cases of injury led to condemnation of the industry as a whole.40 Leonard Smith has noted that the âmythology of crueltyâ emphasised by lunacy reformers"
302,388,0.395,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"6 Conclusion Increased research on (micro)plastics has developed the picture that (micro)plastic pollution is ubiquitous. Microplastics have been detected in rivers in Europe (e.g., Danube, [70]), as well as in lakes in Mongolia [50] and the USA [59]. They cross state boarders, passing from rivers into lakes, and finally into the global common, the ocean. They also cross the boundaries between single organisms, accumulating in the food web. From a social-ecological perspective, the risk induces a vibrancy and resonance in socioeconomic, political, and public spheres. Thus, the theses we have presented and their corresponding data clearly identify microplastics as a global risk, leading to the following conclusions regarding further research areas: Based on an understanding of the risks posed by microplastics as an unintended side effect of the everyday mode of societies, the global dimensions of production and distribution patterns need to be researched in more depth. In many countries of the Global South, a new middle income class with a high demand for plastic products is growing. Relations between the Global North and the Global South need to be addressed more adequately, regarding the production, distribution, consumption, disposal, and leakage into the environment of plastic-packaged products like fast-moving consumer goods. Due to the complexity of the microplastics phenomenon, its assessment is difficult and requires further scientific investigations to establish the evidence in order to properly address the environmental risk. The same holds true for the assessment of the human health risks. This uncertainty impedes risk management decisions, but nevertheless action is required despite a lack of clear evidence, because microplastics are perceived as a threat by society. Therefore, as the complexity of the phenomenon may never be entirely resolved, future research should also focus on the question of how to handle uncertainty and manage complex global risks. Although it is common sense that plastics should not be allowed to accumulate in the environment, much less consensus exists regarding the strategies needed to achieve this. As Shaxson [58] points out, the question âHow can we make plastics sustainable?â is just too broad and unstructured to enable all the interest groups to speak with one voice. Strategies to combat pollution range from reuse, green chemistry, designs for recycling, improved waste management, standardized labeling, education, cleaning programs, and sustainable consumption. Not a single strategy is required, but each sector needs to be active. However, current debates show that responsibilities are often shifted elsewhere. Thus, identifying the risk producers is not straightforward, as some voices do not regard plastics as the source of the problem but rather their improper disposal; other voices emphasize the design of the plastic material, and yet others target consumer behavior. Risk management is about the negotiation of evidence and values. We should not stop at symbolic goals, like the G7 Action Plan [71], but move on to binding regulations. Research should focus on developing and testing mechanisms to call risk producers to account, for example, with the integration of costs in the benefits, extended producersâ responsibility, cost of inaction analysis, etc."
302,354,0.395,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"5 Citizen Science as Concept Science as a paid profession started in the later part of the nineteenth century [4]. Up until then scientific data were produced by people who collected the data due to interest. Some famous examples of citizen scientists were Benjamin Franklin and Charles Darwin [4]. Todayâs citizen science (CS) is most commonly conducted when projects are specifically designed to combine knowledge and expertise from scientists at research institutions with the work of the skilled amateurs, often within conservation biology and monitoring studies [40]. Silvertown [4] proposed that the expanding use of CS is driven by three factors: (1) greater access to the technical tools needed, (2) bringing in additional qualified labor, and (3) a greater demand for outreach within academia. In a historical context, CS has most commonly been used with conservation biology and nature monitoring programs. Examples such as the Atlas Project in Australia, where BirdLife Australia has used CS to obtain more than seven million bird observations for their âAtlas of Australian Birdâ [41], and Herbaria@home, where museum collections of wild plants are analyzed by citizens in the UK for more than a decade [42], serve as illustrations of such classic CS projects. CS has however also been used to monitor pollution. The Air Quality Egg Project in the USA and Europe is a CS project that aims at monitoring air quality. It is based on a sensor system designed to allow citizens to collect data on NO2 and"
302,488,0.394,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"9 Conclusion An environmental movement may be defined as a loose, noninstitutionalized network of organizations of varying degrees of formality, as well as individuals and groups with no organizational affiliation, who are engaged in collective action motivated by shared identity or concern about environmental issues [117]. In July of 2016, the American Chemistry Council published âPlastics and Sustainability: A valuation of environmental benefits, costs and opportunities for continuous improvement,â largely a comparison of life cycle analyses putting plastic in a positive light against alternative materials (glass, metal, paper). At the same time, the Plastic Pollution Policy Project convened 18 organizations focused on zero waste initiatives to align on policy and campaigns and to create common messaging to counter industry-dominated narratives. A movement has emerged, while stakeholder positions have dug in their heels. Here we have discussed solutions to microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, which largely form in terrestrial environments from primary or secondary microplastics. We know that microplastics are global, increasingly toxic over time, and impacts to wildlife are pervasive, leading to the collective conclusion that plastic in the environment causes harm. We also know that capturing microplastic downstream is extremely difficult and requires upstream intervention."
97,94,0.394,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Human activities have generated major environmental changes, which have accelerated from the 1950s onwards. Consequences, e.g., in terms of a changed climate with increasing stormwater events, as well as larger and increased soil and air pollution rates, are eminent today (e.g., NASA 2015). Both evidence and a general understanding exist for the fact that nature is both impacted by environmental changes and offers opportunities to solve a number of the challenges modern urban populations experience in their daily life."
183,341,0.394,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"18.1 Introduction The poor face different levels of impact when exposed to natural hazards than the nonpoor (Hallegatte et al. 2016). In addition, data on the risks poor and vulnerable face and the actual impact they experience is often lacking. The digital divide plays an important role in this as developing countries and within these developing countries, the poor and vulnerable have less access to digital technologies (Leidig and Teeuw 2015). Apart from technological reasons, there are also political and social reasons. For example, the poor often get their income through the informal economy, and their land and resource rights are usually not registered. This lack of data affects the actions of different actors in the preparedness and response phase. Three main actors can be distinguished in the response and preparedness phase (van den Homberg and Neef 2015). The affected community are the people directly and indirectly adversely affected and in need of urgent (humanitarian) assistance. The responding community consists of local or outside community members that support in relief or recovery but are not trained in crisis response. The responding professionals are part of the professional community in the field of disaster management, such as national and local governments, NGOs, and national crisis coordination centers. All these three groups have to decide based on the data and information available to themâin the period just before the disaster hitsâwhich"

These three international publications are integrated and scheduled to provide the coherency essential for nonduplicative and current progress in a field as dynamic and complex as environmental contamination and toxicology. This series is reserved exclusively for the diversified literature on âtoxicâ chemicals in our food, our feeds, our homes, recreational and working surroundings, our domestic animals, our wildlife, and ourselves. Tremendous efforts worldwide have been mobilized to evaluate the nature, presence, magnitude, fate, and toxicology of the chemicals loosed upon the Earth. Among the sequelae of this broad new emphasis is an undeniable need for an articulated set of authoritative publications, where one can find the latest important world literature produced by these emerging areas of science together with documentation of pertinent ancillary legislation. Research directors and legislative or administrative advisers do not have the time to scan the escalating number of technical publications that may contain articles important to current responsibility. Rather, these individuals need the background provided by detailed reviews and the assurance that the latest information is made available to them, all with minimal literature searching. Similarly, the scientist assigned or attracted to a new problem is required to glean all literature pertinent to the task, to publish new developments or important new experimental details quickly, to inform others of findings that might alter their own efforts, and eventually to publish all his/her supporting data and conclusions for archival purposes. In the fields of environmental contamination and toxicology, the sum of these concerns and responsibilities is decisively addressed by the uniform, encompassing, and timely publication format of the Springer triumvirate: Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology [Vol. 1 through 97 (1962â1986) as Residue Reviews] for detailed review articles concerned with"
187,13,0.394,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"Indeed as outlined above as well as noted in [7], many economic, social, political and technological reasons have caused a rapid change in the organisational, operational and technical aspects of infrastructures. These infrastructures, that in the past could be considered as autonomous vertically integrated systems with very few points of contact with respect to other infrastructures, are now tightly coupled and show large numbers of dependencies. This has generated many positive effects to our society and the well-being of populations, but has increased the complexity, the vulnerability of infrastructures and the related risk to our societies at the same time. Several episodes emphasised such fragility. TNO has collected more than 9,550 CI disruption events which caused the failure of 12,400 infrastructure services through cascading between 2005 and now. Some example events are described in Table 1. Even if the example incidents illustrated in Table 1 are very different in terms of primary causes, extension and consequences, all of them are characterised by non-intuitive dependencies and, especially, by inadequate protection measures to manage the crisis. This is mainly due to the incomplete understanding of an event and especially of its direct and indirect consequences [8, 9]. This is, unfortunately, an effect of the increased complexity of the socio-technical scenario largely characterised by the presence of dependencies among different CI."

201,29,0.393,The Pathologisation of Homosexuality in Fascist Italy,"Segregation is identified as a crucial issue of the law. From the midnineteenth century the European bourgeoisie had tried to tackle the increase of social problems created by massive urbanisation. Criminality, prostitution, alcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis and mental alienation, all linked with impoverishment of urban working classes, were among the many tangible social threats that modern life brought. To define these worrying and constantly increasing social phenomena a term came in use, degeneration, that could explain moral decay and the connected tendency to commit crimes.8 As a response to these new impending social threats, scientists started formulating the basic principles of eugenics, a utopian theory whose aim was to identify ways in which human-kind and societies could be improved. Founded in Great Britain by Francis Galton, nephew of Charles Darwin, it spread successfully across Europe, and found in Italy very fertile ground in the second half of the nineteenth century.9 An improved human race would ideally have to rely on reproduction by its best and fittest elements, the ones who had successfully fought and won the battle for survival, according to Darwinian theories. However, after World War I, it became painfully evident that also the fittest and best young men perished. Consequently, the following generation would bear the genes of those who did not fight: the sick, the old, the disabled. Research found a new impulse in trying to avert this natural decay of society. The theoretical debate gradually came to two main positions: the so-called ânegativeâ eugenics, that developed in Protestant Northern European countries, theorised the need to eliminate unfit members of society to improve the âstockâ. This had extreme consequences as it led to compulsive sterilisation programmes in Sweden and Germany, and to the suppression of disabled people during the Nazi regime. Catholic-inspired âpositiveâ eugenics concentrated on ways to cure the unfit, to isolate them and transform them into âbetterâ human beings. How to cure, modify and prevent, therefore, became the most important aspect of the debate in Italy, which involved criminal anthropologists, criminologists, psychiatrists and politicians. Apart from a few voices of dissent, at the beginning of the twentieth century the Italian answer to questions of degeneration was a vigorous demographic campaign that aimed at inverting falling birth rates trends, together with a firm focus on preventative medicine, pre-maternal and"
378,87,0.393,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"prioritize two key points. These were âthe concept of âneeds,â in particular the essential needs of the worldâs poor,â to whom, it argued, âoverriding priority should be givenâ and âthe idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environmentâs ability to meet present and future needsâ (WCED 1987: 41). To reach these goals the Brundtland Commission urged that: âHuman laws must be reformulated to keep human activities in harmony with the unchanging and universal laws of natureâ (WCED 1987: 271). We will see that mainstream economic theory does not provide much understanding as to how to do this but rather offers concepts that keep us blind to these key points. The urge to âintegrateâ environmental, social and economic concerns led to the expansion of the economic mind-set into the governance of ever more areas of life. This effect has been called the âeconomizationâ of societies and its ongoing trending reiï¬es unsustainable path dependencies instead of helping to unlock them. So it is at least as important to limit the realm of issues to which economics are applied as it is to update the entire discipline. So to what questions do economists claim to provide answers? Perhaps the most widely used and accepted deï¬nition was coined by Lionel Robbins, the famous London School of Economics professor who wrote in 1932 that âEconomics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative usesâ (Robbins 1932: 15). Such alternative uses are also called âcompeting endsâ and Robbins argues that the only situations that fall under economic consideration are those in which choices between ends (going to the opera, sleeping or baking bread) need to be taken because the means (time or resources) are limited. Hence, economic situations are those in which some wants need to be relinquished. This means that economics can explain choice making, but cannot shed light on either ends or means. In fact, it was the aim of Robbinsâ essay to limit the concerns addressed by economics. This focus is reflected in the key ideas and concepts that it puts forward and that I have summarized in Table 3.1. All the ideas in the left column clearly ï¬t into the overarching Enlightenment movement that started in the seventeenth century. Its ambition to free humanity from superstitious, theological, and natural limitations to progress generated a rather mechanistic-additive view of systems and the world. Each of the economic"

A common analytical framework guided all five case studies ensuring the comparability of the cases, which were performed using similar research designs (cf. Gilek et al. 2011). All case studies employed an explorativeinterpretative approach of qualitative social research, and their results have been derived from three main sources: document analysis, semi-structured qualitative interviews and a series of round-table events. This allows us to draw conclusions about communicative aspects of environmental governance of BSR, whereas we will also when possible use the case of BSR to discuss regional and marine environmental governance more generally. In the next section, we will introduce our main theoretical perspectives that focus on risk communication in environmental governance, risk communication with and to the public and the role of the news media. We will then turn to our analysis of the empirical material and start with a discussion about existing institutional arrangements and procedures of risk communication and the forms of communication that can be identified. Thereafter we address the topic of risk communication with the public and how this communication can be understood and characterised with a special focus on arenas for communication and the role of the media. Finally, we conclude the chapter with a discussion on the role of public risk communication in (regional) environmental risk governance and possible ways forward."

234,17,0.392,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"FROM âAIDâ TO GLOBAL HEALTH These kinds of anxieties, about the effectiveness of AID, fuelled by political correctness about the use of the term âdevelopmentâ have led to new concepts to capture the investment dimension and focus on longer-term systemic change. The Tropical Health and Education Trust is one of a growing number of intermediaries funded by the UKâs DFID and focusing on âcapacity buildingâ and âsustainabilityâ. Locating itself within the âglobal healthâ agenda, THET describes its mission as building long-term resilient health systems to promote improved access to essential health care as a basic human right (THET 2015). At the centre of this strategy is the concept of âhuman resources for healthâ or âHRHâ. The global health agenda has usefully shifted attention from the havesâhave nots and donorârecipient binaries referred to before, talking instead, somewhat hopefully, of partnerships and âwinâwinâ relationships. Lord (Nigel) Crisp has pushed this agenda forward arguing quite forcefully that the UKâs National Health Service has as much to learn from low-resource settings as vice versa. Focusing again on health systems (rather than poor people per se), Crisp suggests that the concept of global health âembraces everything that we share in health terms globallyâ (2010: 9). Crispâs approach rest on two ideas. First, that health systems in high-resource settings are facing (growing) challenges in terms of resources and sustainability and, second, that globalisation is itself creating complex mobilities (both human and microbial) and interdependencies that effectively challenge the autonomy and resilience of nation states: we are all increasingly connected, whether we like it or not. The growing mobility of health workers or the spread of Ebola are prime examples. It is interesting also to see how Crisp and THET have started to slip the word âinnovationâ alongside development, although they shy away from the language of competition in this ï¬uffy consensual world. In the context of global health, at least the growing emphasis on human resources has usefully shifted the debate from one about providing âtop-downâ cash injections in the form of national or international"

73,659,0.391,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"In the planning phase of adaptation it is important to undertake a whole-of-business approach to drive a deeper and shared understanding of the issues. This ensures that potential climate change risks, exposure and vulnerability, opportunities and adaptation options were identified for all Macedon Ranges directorates. This included Community Wellbeing, Assets and Operations, Corporate Services, Planning and Environment and Organisational Development. Translating and communicating climate change information and scientific data in a meaningful way ensures that the issues are made real and relevant (CRED 2009; TrÃ¼ck et al. 2010). Much of this comes back to understanding the target audience within local government. Using trusted and authoritative knowledge brokers to deliver climate change and scientific data assists in buy-in and builds greater understanding. The technique of âbackcastingâ, or learned experience from recent extreme events, neutralises climate sceptics to focus on real events and data, and in-house lessons. Significant capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment is built in undertaking the steps in the development and planning phases. The process also enables further clarification of roles and responsibilities, which is important in adaptation planning (NCCARF 2012). This includes defining local government, directorate and personnel area of operation, influence and responsibility in regards to adaptation actions, and the role of other external stakeholders. Risk assessments and vulnerability assessment are two quite different processes in determining the possible impact of climate change (Fig. 24.3). Although risk assessments take into account preventative measures and corrective actions from outside the system to reduce the risk, they generally do not explicitly consider any intrinsic capacity from within a system to adapt to the impacts. As a result, the risk assessment may identify a system as at high risk of impact when in fact it may actually adapt quite well without external support, while others that appeared to be at low risk but do not have the internal capacity to adapt on their own are overlooked (Jacqueline Balston and Associates 2012). While the risk assessment approach governed the process for Macedon Ranges, elements of the vulnerability assessment were also used to assess internal council and external capacity to respond to the impacts of changes in climate variables."

169,18,0.391,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(Kagalou et al. 2012). Gari et al. (2015) conclude that two factors explain the widespread use of DPSIR, especially in the realm of policy-related science: â. . .it structures the indicators with reference to the political objectives related to the environmental problem addressed; and . . . it focuses on supposed causal relationships in a clear way that appeals to policy actors (Smeets and Weterings 1999).â However, the use of DPSIR has been complicated by discrepancies in its application, such as the placement of the same variables in different categories (Gari et al. 2015). As applied by the EEA (2003), the categories of the DPSIR framework are described as follows. Driving forces are created by the patterns of production and consumption that emerge from the intertwined social, demographic, and economic developments of society. These forces of societyâs metabolism drive the pressures that impact SES, e.g., emissions of chemical, physical, and biological substances and agents and shifts in land use and land cover. In response to these pressures, the state of an SES can shift physically (temperature), biologically (ï¬sh stocks), and/or chemically (atmospheric CO2, water column nitrogen). Impacts resulting from shifts in ecosystem state are reï¬ected in diminished functioning of the environment, e.g., lower human or ecosystem health, resource availability, and/or biodiversity. Any or all such impacts can precipitate responses to mitigate or adapt, which can emerge at the level of individuals and groups at different levels of organizations (Gari et al. 2015). Management decisions to hold steady or change course beneï¬t from precise measurements, but such choices grow out of many critical decisions that come beforehand. What should be measured, how, to answer what questions or policy dictates, and whose perspective should be included in the discussion? These are among a plethora of decisions that face river managers. With regard to measurements, who decides how to deï¬ne the space and time dimensions of the reference condition? What is the baseline in time against which one measures change (degradation or progress) in ecosystem properties? For example, radically different conclusions can be drawn from the number of salmon found in 2002 in the Northwestern US Columbia River basin depending on when one sets the baseline. The baselineâs date can inspire optimism (200% increase since 1930) or pessimism (90% decline since 1866) (Olson 2002). To shape sound research as well as policy, management must account for the false optimism inherent in such a shifting baseline syndrome (Pauly 1995), which can be reversed if management can integrate ecological restoration within the larger social context, restoring habitat connectivity, local ï¬sh populations, as well as local ï¬sheries (McClenachan et al. 2015). Constructive and effective engagement with these questions can help build a comprehensive overview and a ï¬exible approach that managers need to deal with uncertainty. However, the global decline of river socio-ecosystems reï¬ects a history of management that did not meet these challenges but defaulted to convention and tradition based on previous knowledge and historical relationships. Historically, river management regimes have evolved as complex webs of relationships that reinforce each other and create a momentum carrying them down a development path. In this way, a river system advances along a trajectory determined by complex feedbacks of interacting actors, policies, technologies, and concepts (Sendzimir et al. 2007)."

At the system-level, improved risk coping measures include the design and implementation of disaster risk management plans at various government scales, rapid repair of damaged infrastructure, and, development of insurance instruments targeted for national and municipal governments. Reducing household vulnerability and increasing system resilience can be accomplished through expansion and promotion of ex ante risk management strategies and/or ex post coping strategies. At the household level, ex ante risk management strategies include adopting SLM techniques; irrigation; drought, heat and/or flood resistant crop varieties and livestock breeds; and, diversifying land and labor activities. Measures that can be undertaken to improve the capacity of farm households to cope with shocks when they do occur include access to social safety net programs, access to attractive insurance instruments, and access to information and infrastructure to re-allocate labor to less affected areas. With respect to actions that affect farmersâ incentives, potential actions include payment for environmental services programs; direct subsidies for adoption of certain investments and/or practices such as irrigation or SLM practices; and subsidies for inputs or participation in insurance schemes. The social planner can also undertake actions to increase adaptive capacity and to pursue least-cost strategies of adaptation under an uncertain future climate, including the possibility of âweather migrationâ. Adaptive capacity is a function of available risk management and risk coping mechanisms, but also includes broader measures to improve decision-making under uncertainty. Uncertainty increases the value of putting in place sophisticated monitoring and evaluation systems and continual learning (IPCC 2012) Greater adaptive capacity is associated with increasing the range of options to manage climate extremes and potentially changed climate patterns, and increasing the ability to exercise those options when needed. It should be stressed that the ability to exercise options when needed is often as critical as having options to begin with. For instance, many researchers find that it is precisely wealthier farmers who are more able to diversify their income sources, reconfirming longstanding findings in most sub-Saharan African countries (Davis et al. 2014; Arslan et al. 2015). So, allocating labor off-farm in response to a weather shock means not only that there are labor opportunities somewhere in the country, but also that farmers know where those opportunities are, can afford transportation, and have sufficient skills to be hired. Resilience and adaptive capacity are complementary traits. Greater adaptive capacity can increase a systemâs capacity to recover from swings in climatic and biophysical conditions. But when the pressures exceed some threshold, adaptive"

232,41,0.39,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"1 Introduction The French word dommage (damage) has several translations into English. Two are of particular interest: ï¬rst, it is the partial or total physical destruction of a living being (ranging from physical injury to death) or an object, due to an accident; second, it represents loss, as in the expression âitâs a pityâ or âwhat a pityâ. This polysemy makes it difï¬cult to create an empirical concept in the sense of a class of objects that can be characterized by the elements that compose it. But why even try? Because a deeper understanding of the anthropological meaning of damage can help to identify social dynamics that receive little attention in classical risk prevention studies [1]. In practice, the word appears to designate both the consequences of a disaster, and the losses suffered by humans and non-humans which are serious enough for it to be asserted that the disaster must not happen again. In this case, taking damage and its dynamics into account can help to go beyond the simple issue of loss. D. Pecaud UniversitÃ© de Nantes, Nantes, France D.

224,227,0.39,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"modern lifestyles as they integrate their production systems into a global division of labour. In other words, the prevalent development model promotes the integration of remote communities into the market economy through industrial development approaches based on the use of fossil fuels, either directly (through the industrialisation of agricultural production) or indirectly (through specialised machinery). This appears to be the only means of escaping poverty.2 The ecological crisis of our current times cannot be understated. The crisis is global: 60 % of our ecosystems have been degraded (MEA 2005; Steffen et al. 2004), and in many respects, we have exceeded the safe operating space of the planet. The distortion of the nitrogen cycle is primarily attributed to industrial agriculture and the use of fertilisers (RockstrÃ¶m et al. 2009). As we head towards the erosion of our own natural resource base on a global level, these current development trends run counter to the increasingly accepted notion of sustainable development. A more sustainable global future therefore requires a broader search for pathways where short- and long-term benefits for people come at the lowest possible environmental cost and the lowest possible burden and stress on individuals in terms of working time (Haberl et al. 2004, 2011). Guided by this focus on sustainable development, our primary aim is to gain a better understanding of these transition processes âat the peripheryâ along with the transformative potential and impacts that are generated at the society-nature interface thereof. The conceptual framework of sociometabolic transitions (Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007) is an attempt in this direction. In this context, local rural subsistence communities have been empirically investigated to understand the systemic interrelations between food production systems and the resulting environmental pressures. Comparing and contrasting these cases in terms of their demographic, sociometabolic, and agro-ecological profiles has aided the modelling of development trajectories for larger regions. A variable that is often left out from such analysis is âtime useâ and its link to sociometabolic transitions. While we have previously illustrated our findings on the environmental pressures triggered by the specific material, energy and land use activities in the different communities (see Fischer-Kowalski et al. 2011), the focus of this chapter is the social pressure on individuals in terms of working time and how the burden of labour changes with agricultural development. To this end, we revisit Boserupâs (1965, 1981) theory of agricultural change in subsistence systems and, in particular, her hypothesis on increasing area productivity at the expense of labour productivity as a consequence of technological intensification in traditional farming systems. Boserupâs theory provides a framework for comparing the burden of labour among four contemporary subsistence communities in the global south that are in different stages of agricultural development. We will first provide a brief overview of Boserupâs hypothesis, followed by our sociometabolic concept of human time as a (limited) biophysical resource. What follows is a brief description of the four case studies and methods used for data collection. We then present the main findings and conclude with a brief reassessment of our hypothesis."
365,111,0.39,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"a mechanism to address risk associated with climate change. Like trade, the capacity of aid to address climate change depends on the availability of efficient transportation as well as accurate detection and response systems (Donaldson 2010). Both aid and trade could serve as substitutes to migration as a response to climate change. Research and development may lead to innovations that enable trade or to mechanisms that facilitate provision of aid in times of crisis while maintaining overall social welfare. Innovative approaches that reduce the cost of implementation and increase the effectiveness of aid mechanisms is especially important given financial constraints on such efforts. Movement of water resources (management and conflict resolution) Climate change may drastically change precipitation patterns, as well as lead to significant melting of snow packs, and thus lead to changes in water availability over space and time, water movement and storage patterns. These changes will occur both within and between countries. It will raise issues of property rights that have to be sought and solved before they lead to conflicts. Furthermore, the institutions that currently own and distribute water will lose capacity, and some of them will get into severe financial troubles, as they would not be able to meet their obligations. At the same time, there will be a need to design and develop new water facilities and water distribution organizations that will be able to address the new reality. Addressing these challenges require significant institutional innovations. There will be a need to develop insurance mechanisms for water districts and other water suppliers against the hydrological risks faced, as well as the resulting financial losses. As the knowledge about the changes in water supply and storage patterns emerge, there will be a need to rethink water infrastructure and supply. Designing water systems is a lengthy process and an early start may provide significant edge. The work of Xie and Zilberman (2016) shows that the investment in water project capacity is affected both by changes in water availability as well as the investment in water technology and thus regional planning of water systems is needed prior to the investment in water system modification. One of the most challenging aspects of water resource management is the assignment of water rights. Traditional water rights systems, established during periods of water abundance and under colonial arrangements, can be an obstacle to efficient development of water resources (Schoengold and Zilberman 2007), and water right reform is essential for improvement to allocation. Legal and policy research that lead to innovative water right reform will be an important step in designing and implementing strategies to address water supply implications of climate change. Insurance regulations Risk and uncertainty are the most challenging aspects of climate change. New designs of institutions to address these two facets are a major challenge. It is especially important to develop mechanisms that ensure farmers have insurance against extreme events. Much of the literature on crop insurance argues that it serves frequently as a subsidy rather than insurance per se, and farmers tend to undersubscribe to insurance schemes that are self-supporting. Furthermore, subsidized insurance may lead to engaging in risky and environmentally damaging behavior (see survey by Smith and Goodwin 2013). There are new forms of"
180,502,0.389,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"doctors, nurses, and rehydration packs proved inadequate. The epidemic exploded across Haiti. Since cholera was not endemic, the population lacked immunity. Within months, thousands of people had died and hundreds of thousands had been sickened. NGOs and some international donor agencies, including from the U.N., who were already in Haiti dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake, diverted resources to combat cholera. They distributed medical supplies, organized educational campaigns on cholera prevention, trucked clean drinking water and water purification tablets across the country, and worked with local hospitals to institute rigorous infection control measures. The Haitian and international response to the cholera outbreak rapidly brought the case fatality rate from around 9 % to less than 1 %. Although the outbreak died down, the aid efforts failed to rectify the dire state of Haitiâs water and sanitation infrastructure. During the rainy season, cases would spike again, exposing the difficulty of improving the Haitian health care system so that it could respond to new outbreaks without external assistance. Haiti had been cholera-free for more than a centuryâso how had cholera got there? Almost as soon as the outbreak started, rumors circulated blaming U.N. peacekeepers. A contingent of soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, had arrived in October 2010. They were stationed at a camp on a tributary of the Artibonite River near where the outbreak began. Waste management at the base was rumored to be inadequate and had allowed sewage to flow into the river. Initially, U.N. officials denied responsibility for bringing cholera to Haiti. But rumors and public protest persisted, fueled by independent investigations suggesting the camp as the source (Piarroux et al. 2011). Finally, the U.N. Secretary General convened an independent panel of experts charged with determining the source of the cholera outbreak. The panel completed its report in May 2011. It argued that the evidence from the Artibonite Riverâs tributary system, the epidemiological timeline, and genetic analyses of Haitian V. cholerae bacteria indicated that the outbreak resulted from contamination of the river with feces carrying a strain of the current South Asian bacterium. Moreover, the report noted that the âhaphazardâ plumbing construction in the main toilet and showering area offered significant potential for cross-contamination, and that heavy rains could cause the open septic pit into which black water was deposited to overflow into the tributary (Cravioto et al. 2011). The report offered a series of recommendations to prevent similar occurrences and concluded The introduction of this cholera strain as a result of environmental contamination with feces could not have been the source of such an outbreak without simultaneous water and sanitation and health care system deficiencies. These deficiencies, coupled with conducive environmental and epidemiological conditions, allowed the spread of the Vibrio cholerae organism in the environment, from which a large number of people became infected. The independent panel concludes that the Haiti cholera outbreak was caused by the confluence of circumstances as described above and was not the fault of, or deliberate action of, a group or individual (Cravioto et al. 2011)."
302,202,0.389,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The role of the general public through awareness and active involvement (i.e., citizen science) is discussed in detail elsewhere in this book, both with an historical overview and specifics related to MP pollution (see Syberg et al. this volume [62]). Briefly it could be suggested that in comparison to other environmental issues, the public has been invaluable in assessing the magnitude of plastics and MP pollution through volunteer beach cleanups and surveys that provide data for monitoring programmers, as well as carrying out the practical task of removing beach litter. In the USA most information regarding the abundance and distribution of beach debris has been derived from volunteer beach cleaning efforts [63], and such public involvement is also occurring elsewhere. Public collaboration with scientific research has taken place in a number of locations worldwide, for instance, the collection of marine litter in the Firth of Forth, Scotland [64], collection of beach debris along the coast of southeast Chile [65], and many volunteers mobilized for beach surveys in South Africa [66]. However, to the best of our knowledge, such public-involving initiatives have not been attempted in areas surrounding African freshwaters. Part of this problem may be, as has been discussed, a scarcity of information regarding the scale of potential MP pollution, which results in a lack of funding and a lack of awareness. As discussed, funding for environmental issues may not be the highest priority in most African countries, but NGOs which could collaboratively work with various public sectors have paid little or no attention in raising public awareness in the issue of plastic waste management [67]. Similarly, the opportunities for 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) are not well explored and advocated in developing countries [68]. It has been suggested that improved education on the issues of waste management in developing countries, and the preparation and training of environmental professionals and technicians, could be the way forward. Some developing countries have reported positive effects from investing in education, such as citizens assuming responsibility and higher status of waste workers, which have resulted in cleaner cities [68]. Such programs would potentially have similar results in urbanized regions around African freshwaters, and the downstream effect of cleaner cities would be less urban waste from which to produce MPs. But as mentioned earlier in this section, the increase of awareness and education of the population must be coupled with an increase in effective waste management and ultimately coherent regional political action."

It is intended to be a thought-provoking look at insights gained in communicating biodiversity science for policy purposes over the last several years. With a particular focus on indicators, one of the most common forms in which observations are used by decision-makers, the chapter considers the context in which indicators are used and how they are developed. It explores the realities of indicator development and use, including some of the key challenges and ways around them.

A social-ecologicaltechnological systems (SETs) approach (illustrated in Fig. 6.1) can be a useful framework to understand the dynamic interactions between social, ecological, and technical-infrastructural domains of urban systems. The SETs approach aims at overcoming the limitation of a purely socio-technological approach which tends to exclude ecological functions, or of a social-ecological approach inclined to overlook critical roles of technology and infrastructure as fundamental constituents, and drivers of urban system dynamics (McPhearson et al. 2016a). As the SETs approach, can broaden the spectrum of the options available for intervention (Grimm et al. 2016), it is therefore a suitable framework to explore the range of options available and needed to adapt to climate impacts in the urban context. Using this framework, we investigate the pros and cons of adapting to climate change through grey infrastructures (i.e. hard or engineering approaches), âgreenâ and âblueâ approaches (i.e. the restoration of ecosystems, various types of"

This event horizonâthe next Big Oneâprovides an important perspective on a set of operations that happen each and every day in this area, and which, from residential choices to seismic-mapping activities, from memorialization to projection, deï¬ne and help bring the potential consequences of a major earthquake into existenceâinto visibility. This ethnography is built on my own research in the Bay Area of San Francisco, where I have identiï¬ed the network of scientists and experts who connect science with their own experience of living in a seismic place and help making the Bay Area resilient [82]. As discussed above, when it come to evaluating a risk or thinking about a disaster, âknowingâ is a complex operation. In the academic context, it is often taken for granted that scientiï¬c and expert knowledge surpasses lay knowledge, and that risk would be better prevented if only residents could think more as scientists do. Here, I want to show that, in the Bay Area, scientists and experts have also learned to think as residents do; re-deï¬ning their hierarchical categories, comparing and discussing everyday risks to re-situate the earthquake threat in a time frame and context of an individualâs life span. As discussed by one respondent living in San Francisco, involved in risk prevention and the development of building codes, With earthquakes, theyâre so rare and extreme that to understand them, you have to think of them in the spectrum of everyday risks, monthly risks, and yearly risks. These all get compiled together and, most people, whether they articulate it or not, theyâre aware of that difference. You rarely ï¬nd people that dumb that they donât understand risk in their daily life. [It] doesnât mean they always make the informed decisions, but they have an innate understanding of the rarity of things.10"
38,431,0.388,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"10.2.2 Modelling Across Space and Time, Present to Future Other applications of modelling to policy development, planning and management require explanatory and/or predictive modelling to be performed not only across space, but also across time. The use of modelling to predict potential changes in biodiversity into the future, often referred to as âforecastsâ or âprojectionsâ (Coreau et al. 2009), as a function of ongoing impacts of environmental drivers (e.g., climate and land-use change), has gained particular prominence in recent years (Pereira et al. 2010; Cook et al. 2014). Such modelling poses special challenges, as there is usually considerable uncertainty associated with the future trajectories of relevant environmental drivers, which themselves will be affected by socio-economic events and decisions that are yet to occur, and are therefore highly unpredictable. These uncertainties are often addressed through the use of scenariosâi.e., multiple plausible trajectories for environmental drivers, that account for the reality that not just one, but many, futures are possible (van Vuuren et al. 2012). Model-based biodiversity projections under plausible scenarios of change in key drivers can contribute signiï¬cantly to policy agenda setting, by helping to characterise and communicate the potential magnitude of ongoing change in biodiversity, and therefore the need for action. By extending scenarios to further consider the effects of alternative policy or management interventions, such projections can also play an important role in decision supportâi.e., helping policy-makers, planners and managers to choose between possible actions for addressing the problem at hand, by modelling the difference that each of these alternatives is expected to make to projected outcomes for biodiversity (Cook et al. 2014). As for predictive modelling across geographical space, projections of biodiversity change into the future can be based on either inductive or deductive modelling (Pereira et al. 2010). When inductive models are employed for future projection, these are most often derived from correlative data analysis (i.e., explanatory modelling) of relationships between biodiversity and environmental drivers observed across space alone, rather than across time. Using such models to project changes across time involves space-for-time substitution. This assumes that"

Devising such approaches for any wildlife host of a livestock disease will depend upon studies at the landscape scale and population level to understand such issues as: seasonal movements between feeding areas; joining-and-leaving behavior of contagious individuals moving between social groups; use of habitats at key times for disease transmission; effects of climate on the dynamics of populations and the aggregation and dispersal of groups and individuals; and responses to fear induced by hunting and predation. In addition, there are calls for trade policy reforms to relax stringent veterinary regulations such as those responsible for veterinary cordon fences in southern Africa (Fynn and Bonyongo 2011; McGahey 2011; Thomson et al. 2013). There, the fences have decimated migratory wildlife populations that, in the longer term, could be more valuable to local communities than export-quality beef. At a minimum, certain wildlife species should be destigmatized as disease vectors, such as bison in North America and buffalo in South Africa, because disease-free herds can be established and used to restock areas where they can safely comingle with cattle."

Moreover, it takes into account the multiple conceptualizations of and claims over nature as part of a contested sphere, which we denominate âenvironmental governanceâ. The three parts of this book address the changing context, social interactions and institutional adaptations in contemporary natureâsociety relations in Latin America. Part I introduces the socioenvironmental context through a focus on the historical legacy of Latin American environmentalist thinking, the increasing pressure on the regionâs environment due to the global demand for its natural resources, and the rich ecological knowledge within local communities. These chapters set the stage to analyse the recent transformations of natureâsociety relations in the region. Part II addresses the politics of nature, raising issues related to the role of powerful actors â the state, elite and corporations â and their interactions in shaping discourses and practices regarding natural resource use. These processes are explored through the analysis of new policy models deployed by post-neoliberal governments, the role of new and old elites and their interactions, the narratives around the waterâenergyâmining nexus by contesting actors, and strategies for poverty alleviation. In Part III, new and emerging forms of environmental governance that tackle issues of participation, autonomy and environmental security are examined. The analysis of the implementation of REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), the controversial international compensatory scheme to prevent climate change, addresses how participatory mechanisms have become invited spaces of selected legitimized groups while the bottom-up initiatives of community-based autonomous economies and local consultations to mining projects that address the struggles for effective inclusion, wellbeing and justice emerged from resistance movements. In general, this volume aims to understand environmental governance in Latin America by looking into the ways in which historical legacies and current socioenvironmental contexts are driving new social interactions and institutional adaptations among multiple actors. The chapters cover a range of Latin American countries, mostly based on empirical data from multiple contexts, actors and production systems, and focus on transnational, national or subnational processes. Together they provide an overview of current regionwide trends, and a variety of themes and approaches to environmental governance, which feeds lively and sometimes heated debates in academia as well as in civil society and policy-making circles."
232,581,0.388,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The attention toward examining the multiple impacts of disasters, and the challenges they make visible for large metropolitan areas, is not recent. One of the most famous historical examples is the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which had a considerable influence on the emergence of scientiï¬c knowledge. The Great Lisbon Earthquake, estimated at M.8.5 to 9.0 on the Richter scale, is credited with transforming the social, philosophical, and metaphysical paradigms of the time. Some have gone so far as to state that this moment marked the beginning of the era of European Enlightenment [3â9]. Discussing the importance of the Great Lisbon Earthquake for continental philosophy, Gilles Deleuze argues that the event had an intellectual and metaphysical impact equivalent to the one of Holocaust in the twentieth century: It is very curious that in the eighteenth century, it is the Lisbon earthquake which assumes something like that, when across Europe people said: how is it still possible to maintain a certain optimism founded on God? You see, after Auschwitz raised the question: how it is possible to maintain a fading optimism about human reason. After the Lisbon earthquake, how is it possible to maintain the fading belief of rationality in divine origin?3 (My translation, [10])."

Engineering approaches largely ignore or supplant the functions of biophysical systems. Through the SETs lens these approaches tend to be located fully within the technological domain with little input from ecological domains. Grey infrastructures provide an important means of adapting to biophysical challenges including hazards and climate driven extreme events, but are often costly to install and maintain, have long-term effects on ecosystems, tend to have low flexibility, and when they fail can generate catastrophic impacts on social and ecological domains of urban SETs. Despite this, in some cases grey infrastructures might still be needed. For instance, Khazai et al. (2007) reviewed the role and effectiveness of coastal structures in reducing damage to coastal communities from tsunamis and storm surges caused by cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons, finding that concrete seawalls are the most durable protection against various types of storm surges. Still the he SETs framework helps elucidate the need to recognize that grey infrastructures are not isolated systems but embedded in and affect social and ecological components of the urban system. In urban systems, habitat loss is often a direct consequence of the hardening of coastal and inland water systems. Grey infrastructures for coastal defence have also been criticized for inhibiting normal coastal processes (Khazai et al. 2007). Social and ecological systems are co-evolutionary (Norgaard 1994; Kallis 2007) in the sense that they evolve while influencing eachother thus creating sharp contrast with fixed, long-lasting grey infrastructures that lack flexibility to be. For these and other reasons tied to the long term impacts engineered infrastructures, such as sea walls or wastewater treatment plants, have on neighbouring social communities, these projects increasingly encounter high resistance by residents especially those concerned with the environment, health and sustainability. Though engineered systems can have enormous benefits (clean water, sanitation, etc.) they can also lead to undesirable system lock-ins and path dependency which make their negative impacts, and even the infrastructure itself, difficult to reverse (Dawson 2007). Expanding cities increasingly rely on grey infrastructures for their protection with sprawling areas and informal settlements are often located in hazardprone areas. A false sense of security generated by these protective infrastructures can in fact lead populations to further expand in unsafe areas increasing their exposure to hazards and further aggravating risk (Mitchell 2003). Grey infrastructures can fail, especially when confronted with climate driven extreme events. Ready examples include the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in New York City in 2012. These types of weather-related hazards overtopped levees, sea walls, and storm barriers engineered to protect people and ecosystems from hurricanes and storm surges, and ultimately failed with disastrous consequences. Climate change creates uncertainty and system non-stationarity. Thus future risk is not easily taken into account in planning and building of infrastructures (Hallegatte 2009). For example, a levee designed to accommodate a certain future level storm"

For example, artiï¬cial aquatic ecosystems like reservoirs are novel landscape elements that alter the social, cultural, and economic features of local communities and their approaches to natural resources management. In Burkina resource users pursue ï¬sh conservation with little governmental support (Butterworth et al. 2010), but little is known as to how far local people can assume responsibility to manage waters and ï¬sh (Ouedraogo 2010).

In addition, development research in Africa has a tragic history of narrowly focusing on technical methods whose use terminates with the end of each project and never become integrated into the policy and practice of society (Raynaut 1997; Batterbury and Warren 2001).

CGIAR itself has long recognized these weaknesses and embarked on a far-reaching reform process in 2010. The challenges of demonstrating wide-reaching impact through R4D are compounded by a rapidly growing human population, climate change and other complexities of our time. The human population has almost doubled from 3.8 billion in 1971 to 7.3 billion in 2014 (UN 2015b). With an expected extra two to three billion people to feed over the next 40 years, this will require targeted research efforts to achieve not just growing 70 % more food but making 70 % more food available on the plate to keep up with rapidly rising demand (WWAP 2012). Climate change is already affecting agriculture in many developing countries, and the effects will become increasingly challenging in the future. Higher temperatures, shifting disease and pest pressures, and more frequent and severe droughts and flooding will affect agricultural production and place increasing pressure on water and other natural resources (IPCC 2013). Climate change impacts are increasing the vulnerabilities of populations that are already struggling with food insecurity and poverty, even in the relatively conservative scenario of a global 2-degree temperature rise (Thornton et al. 2014a)."

From the point of view of an observant social scientist, the situation after the 2004 reformation at the UTNEM was just an âadditionâ of the social scientific part, appropriately suggested by the prospectus cited above. This addition model was not a totally meaningless change, of course, but it was not sufficient to cope with contemporary difficult issues centering around nuclear utilization in a so-called post-industrial society. This process of âintegrationâ seems to require a long-term effort to be accomplished. The Fukushima Daiichi accident clearly exposed the incompleteness of the past efforts at âintegration,â as various chapters of this book discuss in detail; even in 2014, three years after the accident, it seems to be still on going. The abilities required of leading engineers in this post-industrial era are not just to pursue technological development as prescribed (typically by governmental long-term plans or other national programs), but to grasp multi-dimensional needs for technology, to develop technology in collaboration with different stakeholders under a more open societal process, and to fulfill their social responsibility in compliance with values shared within society."
10,293,0.387,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"intensity of âproblem perspectives and goal ambitionsâ are the only restrictive contextual factors. Regarding the assessment criteria, extent is the most supportive criterion, since three of the governance dimensions are assessed as supportive, while a neutral level is observed for two dimensions. Coherence is identiï¬ed as the relatively weaker criterion compared to other three criteria, since it is assessed as neutral on four dimensions and as restrictive on one dimension. Regarding coherence, the restrictiveness is mainly attributed to the fact that drought measures are not integrated into the existing water use, management and governance systems, partly due to the long-term competition that exists among different water user sectors (agriculture versus industry versus nature) and among different regions (east versus west). Nevertheless, the collaborative and trust-based atmosphere, which is developed through different projects and initiatives, is seen as a solid basis to reach coherent problem and system perspectives as well as collaborative and participatory mechanisms. The increasing understanding on the risks of drought for all water users creates a collaborative environment for all the stakeholders. Regarding the restrictiveness of the intensity, the historically grounded concern on âtoo much waterâ and thus the dominance of managing the flood risk plays a major role. This historical context makes it difï¬cult to diversify the priorities towards combating with âtoo little waterâ. The water authorities invest time and money in improving their monitoring and enforcement systems towards better managing the system. However, actors such as NMO and LTO put relatively lower effort in such initiatives, due to a lack of ï¬nancial resources and technical knowledge, respectively."

Policymakers in cities and at the sub-national level can lead the way in making the transition towards increasing resilience and integrating ecological concerns within urban planning and decision-making. Instead of an infrastructure agenda in which nature is a problem, a cost, and a political risk, nature can become part of the solution. Cities around Europe have already shown a commitment to integrating nature into their urban planning and management, and thereby demonstrated awareness of the importance of protecting natural capital. The Regional Climate Plan for Paris, for example, highlights the importance of protecting ecosystems in order to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Conseil Regional DâÃle-De-France 2011). The city also recognises that forest management practices which optimise their capacity for adaptation and resilience can lead to multiple benefits for biodiversity, people and the city (Natureparif 2015).

However, they were not the only ones. Many farmers believed that their shepherds knew more about sick sheep and so summoned vets infrequently to their farms.26 They also consulted country medical practitioners about the health of their stock.27 Wider medical interest is revealed by commentaries on sheep diseases that appeared in the medical press.28 Doctors investigated these diseases in private farmbased research programmes, in their capacities as appointees to government committees of enquiry, and as public health doctors who worked to prevent animal challenges to human health.29 for example, Dr David Hamilton, the key medical participant in braxy and louping ill research, studied sick sheep during hiking holidays in the Highlands. Reportedly âon the news of an animal dying from braxy he would take to the hill with the shepherdsâ. He also conducted enquiries into cattle diseases on behalf of the HAS.30 Other expert participants in sheep disease investigations included amateur natural historians, and professional life scientists who occupied recently established university posts in biology and agriculture. Their involvement reflected the importance that the farmers who sponsored and promoted these investigations placed on the environment as a contributor to sheep disease. farming discussions frequently referred to the health implications of geology, soil, vegetation, season, temperature, wind direction, the lie of the land, and the presence of parasitic ticks and flukes that fed off sheep bodies and whose existence was, in turn, shaped by the characteristics of the soil, season and vegetation.31 Similar factors were commonly invoked in discussions of human health, particularly within colonial contexts.32 However, they had special 26 Armatage (1894). 27 Tellor (1879). 28 for example: Hutchinson (1877), âThe Report of the Departmental Committeeâ (1906), âThe Pathology of Louping-Ill and Braxyâ (1906).

The Latin American concept of âecological debtâ has been very fruitful and has provoked important debates, as has the emphasis on the human right to water, supported by Bolivia on the experience of the Cochabamba âwater warsâ of 2000. Latin America is at a crossroads where various critical political and economic theories are seeking a point of convergence with environmentalism, which will give it the opportunity to present a real alternative to extractivism. One of the crucial challenges will be to transfer these debates to the new circles of politicians and policy-makers. This has been a permanent challenge in Latin American environmental history, but today it has a renewed intensity."

On the other hand, economic modelling is often criticized by political practitioners as a purely academic exercise that fails to provide practical tools for understanding or designing optimal real-life economic processes (Geurts and Joldersma 2001). Accordingly, scholars promote participatory policy analysis that is characterized by an interaction between economic theory and political praxis to combine the âobjectiveâ knowledge derived from economic theories and empirical data with the âsubjectiveâ knowledge of stakeholder organizations as political practitioners (Durning 1993; Joldersma 1997; Geurts and Joldersma 2001). Moreover, inadequate communication between scientific policy analysts and political actors is proposed to be a principal cause of the limited impact of research on policymaking. For example, the âutilization of knowledge schoolâ emphasizes the fact that policy analysts and policymakers live in two separate communities (Geurts and Joldersma 2001). Hence, to become more efficient, the relationship between scientific experts and policy actors must be redefined. For example, Duke (1974) discusses the role of the interaction between scientific experts and political practitioners within the theoretical perspective of policy learning. In this context, we suggest the evolutionary Computable General Political Economy Equilibrium Model (eCGPE) as a quantitative approach to modeling and evaluating policy processes. In contrast to standard political economy approaches that focus on political incentive problems and have primarily ignored imperfect political knowledge as a source of inefficient development policies (for example, see Persson and Tabellini 2000), the CGPE approach explicitly allows a quantitative assessment of the impact of both imperfect political incentives and imperfect political knowledge. While the theoretical CGPE approach has already been introduced in the chapter âModeling and Evaluation of Political Processes: A New Quantitative Approachâ this chapter provides an empirical application of the CGPE approach to the case of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) reform in Malawi. CAADP reform in Malawi is a good case in point. First, despite some positive trends, high levels of poverty, poor health, malnutrition and hunger continue to plague Malawi. Second, while it is commonly agreed that these disappointing outcomes are caused in large part by suboptimal public policies, the causes of the continuing failure of the Malawi government to provide optimal public policies remain unknown. Is the Malawi government unwilling to implement the right policies due to biased political incentives or is the government simply unable to implement effective policies due to inadequate political knowledge? For example, by adopting CAADP, the Malawian government, in agreement with the governments of 21 other African countries, committed to a strong role of agriculture in economic development. The pursuit of a 6% annual growth rate in agriculture via the allocation of at least 10% of public resources to the agricultural sector is one of the main principles of CAADP. However, although there is a general agreement among African development specialists that any poverty reduction strategy in Africa must consider rural development and incomes, the role of agriculture in African development is controversial (Brzeska et al. 2012). First, the optimal allocation of public"

Suddenly, one or more of the pupils get a flu. We expect that the flu may spread quite effectively or die out. The question is how many of the pupils and the schoolâs staff will be affected. Some quite simple mathematics can help us to achieve insight into the dynamics of how the disease spreads. Let the mathematical function S.t/ count how many individuals, at time t, that have the possibility to get infected. Here, t may count hours or days, for instance. These individuals make up a category called susceptibles, labeled as S. Another category, I, consists of the individuals that are infected. Let I.t/ count how many there are in category I at time t. An individual having recovered from the disease is assumed to gain immunity. There is also a small possibility that an infected will die. In either case, the individual is moved from the I category to a category we call the removed category, labeled with R. We let R.t/ count the number of individuals in the R category at time t. Those who enter the R category, cannot leave this category. To summarize, the spreading of this disease is essentially the dynamics of moving individuals from the S to the I and then to the R category:"

As a result, major parts of the global society are not able to participate in an improved food supply or in increased standards of living. In the coming decades an improved food supply will not only rely on linear perpetuation of current exploitation of natural resources but also on intelligent and new approaches to solve existing problems. Many of these solutions are very simple and easy to implement such as using underutilized raw materials and food resources and initiating small-holder farmers in developing countries to grow biofuel crops such as Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) or Pongam (Pongamia pinnata). Some of this production can occur on underutilized land to improve their ï¬nancial situation by generating cash income. Other more sophisticated solutions are waiting in the Silicon Valleys around the globe for their utilization, solutions like in vitro-meat or fruit-based vaccines and similar approaches. Although rational thinking and reliance on science are essential for solutions, social distortions and imbalances coupled with religious and ideological intolerance, hate, and lack of education and insight must be addressed and resolved. Thus the solutions require not only science but also fundamental changes in the social dimensions."

Nevertheless, research partnerships between both regions need to be diversified and strengthened, while the priorities and mutual benefit of bi-regional health research cooperation partnerships must be continuously assessed. Partnerships could not only gain prominence in future programmes but also have an impact going much beyond health issues, touching on agriculture, food security, climate change and biotechnologyâand these fields could be broadly integrated in research for health. Major challenges remain ahead, however. Few European businesses have yet engaged or expressed interest in engagement in bi-regional health R&I cooperation: so should initiatives such as the IMI call on Ebola be encouraged and involve African partners. Similarly, funding for cooperation in health research between Africa and Europe should not only focus on EU policy instruments and financing mechanisms but also develop new models like those used by ERAfrica and the ERA-Net co-fund for Africa on FNSSA (LEAP-AGRI). Last but not least, should the RFI become a mainstream instrument, it would provide a valuable global tool that can be used to systematically improve research collaborations involving collaborators from Africa and Europe."

The ï¬rst two discourse models have a technical bias (hard technologies and management technologies); the third and fourth discourse models have ideological-political biases, the last being traversed by ecological worldviews. From the perspective of environmental governance, the positions behind the models point at disagreement. They will be a great source of conï¬ict to the extent that some defend the thesis of economic growth, taking ecological factors into account only as secondary externalities (positions found in the ï¬rst model). Others take an alternative stance, proposing an ecological perspective that focuses on avoiding economic growth and overconsumption in the neo-extractivist Third World (positions found in the fourth model). The analysed discourses, with few exceptions, do not take long-term environmental risks into account. The central grid of this discursive logic is the capacity to control and intervene in water and energy consumption in mining, through technocratic (ï¬rst model), normative and institutional (models two and three), or political-environmental (models three and four) means. The abstraction of the accumulative and latent effects of the long-term environmental impacts of the abovementioned consumption is proof that the autonomized effects of sociotechnical processes as a result of the increased extractive economy in the region are unknown. Our study of discourses conï¬rms that most of the stakeholders who are more likely to defend the expanded reproduction of the waterenergy-mining complex â as the basis of the socioeconomic development of the region â do not take responsibility for the international and global implications of local environmental behaviour. The majority of these actors do not think in terms of a long-term global horizon. Consequently, the problems of climate change and the decisions that they implicate in terms of energy and water policy are considered without taking into account the reï¬exivity of local social processes in overall environmental risks. The structural positions of these stakeholders in developing countries, in the periphery of the world system, thus condition discourses with respect to these global implications. In this chapter we ï¬rst presented the problem of water and energy consumption in the mining sector, situated within the water-energymining complex. We sought to clarify linear, sectorial and reductionist perspectives and to approach a perspective that integrates synergies among discourses, rules, technologies, institutions and interpretations"

364,244,0.384,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Farmers and fishermen perceive the risks associated with environmental degradation and its long-term negative consequences as affecting not only themselves but the community as a whole. The risks are of both natural and anthropogenic origins. Those of natural origin include typhoons, strong winds, El NiÃ±o, and seasonal variations brought about by climate and/or weather disturbances. In Silang-Santa Rosa, these have the effects of altering the crop cycle, and reducing crop productivity and income. Other types of risks include outbreaks of pests and diseases, crop losses from toxic chemicals, soil erosion and acidity, depressed market prices, and land use conversion. Farmers and fishermen have faced these risks to some degree for years. However, in the upstream, 46 % claimed that their level of exposure to such risks is low. A low level of exposure was also cited by 25 % in the midstream, 100 % in the upper downstream, and 50 % in the lower downstream. This can be attributed to the respondentsâ resiliency and the measures they have adopted to address the risks. Factors affecting their level of resiliency include their earning capacity, family assets, and asset management, as well as support from family and relatives that provide financial assistance in times of need. One specific adaptive measure taken in Silang-Santa Rosa is to immediately replant to replace damaged crops. Otherwise farmers simply wait for crops to recover naturally, or go and seek off-farm or nonfarm employment. However, these adaptive measures are generally makeshift and do little to reduce the impacts of climatic events and other forms of risks. They are also very dependent"

Meanwhile, the challenge with complex systems is that they often have delays in their feedback structures, depending on the available stocks of resources that can be used, like credit, for a certain amount of time. In addition, the effects on one resource or biophysical process are typically linked with other natural cycles and may lead to accelerated feedback loops that have nothing to do with the original human activities. This means that problems often only become visible or tangible when it is no longer easy to put a halt to the damage they are causing. The linear causality image of a kettle removed from a stove when it whistles is utterly misleading. MIT professor John Sterman and Harvard education expert Linda Booth-Sweeney explain this âwrong mental modelâ in the context of climate change. It assumes, they argue, that it will only require short delays in all the links in a long causal chain, stretching from the detection of adverse climate impacts to the decision to implement mitigation policies to emissions reductions to changes in atmospheric GHG [Greenhouse Gas] concentrations to radiative forcing to surface warming and ï¬nally to climate impacts, including changes in ice cover, sea level, weather patterns, agricultural productivity, the distribution of species, extinction rates, and the incidence of diseases, among others. None of these conditions hold: there are long delays in every link of the chain (Sterman/Sweeney 2007: 214)."
118,619,0.383,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"scientific analyses of radiation, reactors, and regulations. Starting off the program with these lectures implicitly communicated its priority to the students; it was important to know this information first. Throughout the day, the discussions considered how this kind of scientific information was and was not communicated to the public. Many engineers felt that it was their responsibility to do some of this public communicating and also to act as information gatekeepers. One student, for example, remarked that it was irresponsible to risk panic by releasing data to the public before professionals were able to act on it.3 Students also expressed that their role was to model and measure the available data in order to bound problems, but also expressed concerns about how and what to measure. The second day included lectures on the future of reactor design and on the ethics and âsafety cultureâ of nuclear power plants, which fueled a discussion about engineeringâs reliance on utilitarian reasoning. The first presentations from social scientists began midweek, in which new ways of thinking about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident were introduced. Students were asked to reconsider the challenges of building interdisciplinary awareness across engineering and the social sciences, but also across the more specialized fields within engineering and science (e.g., between nuclear engineers and climate scientists). The social scientists provided students with examples of how to study the institutional and organizational factors that are shaping the ongoing events at Fukushima, including the arrangements between regulatory bodies, industry, government, and academia. Instead of framing the accident in terms that are familiar to engineers, such as safety culture, students were encouraged to consider how social conditions and institutions had shaped the definition of safety. A historical perspective, for example, shows us that nuclear power is judged with great severity, in part because of the public fear of radiation. For this reason, analyses that compare the risks of nuclear power with those of motor vehicles or airplane crashes are not always meaningful. Looking back on the events surrounding 3 Mile Island reminds engineers that severe accidents will happen and that it is important to communicate about them openly and critically. After a day of social science immersion, students had an opportunity to begin in depth discussions with one another. This provided an important space for students to identify issues beyond their professorsâ gaze. For engineering students, this is a necessary exercise to facilitate a pedagogical shift away from lecturestyle learning, and to allow each student to develop a perspective and voice that is different than their professorsâ. A recent study of the undergraduate experience of engineers as compared to students in computer science, science, technology, math, arts and humanities, social sciences, business, and other majors determined that engineering students spend considerably more time preparing for class and have the highest number of credit hours, many of which are spent in lecture [21]. Engineering students quickly learn how to intake and apply the information from lectures wherein the focus is on finding the most efficient way to complete problem sets rather than critically engaging each professorâs views. 3 To protect the privacy of the Summer Schoolâs participants, comments are not linked with individuals."
36,381,0.383,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.1 Introduction Over the past decades, the emergence of zoonotic viruses (those that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans) from bats has been the subject of increasing attention from both scientists and the general public (e.g. Quammen 2013). During outbreaks of diseases in humans and livestock, bats are now often the primary focus of searches for a reservoir host (Chua et al. 2002a; Leroy et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Halpin et al. 2007; Towner et al. 2007; Lau et al. 2010; Wibbelt et al. 2010; Memish et al. 2013). Identification of bats as natural hosts for emerging viruses has important implications for bat conservation. We review the current state of research of four important families of emerging zoonotic viruses for which bats are natural reservoir hosts and discuss direct and indirect conservation implications."

118,357,0.383,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"than that of science, or of technology, or of society is worthy of attention to understand the development of my argument. For example, if nuclear physics is completely successful in understanding a chain reaction, technology such as nuclear engineering could fail in controlling the reaction as in the case of Chernobyl.1 Or if nuclear engineering is almost completely successful in containing radioactive materials within reactors, social decision-making could fail as in the case of Three Mile Island (TMI).2 Or if society is completely successful in setting goals for the development of renewable energy technologies, science and/or technology could fail as in the case of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC).3 In a word, the success or failure of science, of technology, and of society cannot be overlapped automatically [9, 10]. In particular, there seems to be something missing in-between, which has unique characteristics of its own. The concept of âstructural disasterâ is intended to explore this state. What is in-between could be institutional arrangements, organizational routines, tacit interpretations of a formal code of ethics, invisible customs, or the networks of interests of different organizations. The âstructural disasterâ consists of one or more of the following elements [11]: 1. Adherence to erroneous precedents causes problems to be carried over and reproduced. 2. The complexity of a system under consideration and the interdependence of its units aggravate problems. 3. The invisible norms of informal groups essentially hollow out formal norms. 4. Quick fixes for problems at hand lead to further such fixes for temporary counter measures. 5. Secrecy develops across different sectors and blurs the locus of agents responsible for the problems to be addressed. This chapter focuses on, among other things, the interdependence of heterogeneous agents, which come into play in the science-technology-society interface and give rise to secrecy in a specific social condition. This chapter will make clear the interdependence by tracing it back to the hidden prewar accident, which will give us an important clue to the understanding of the Fukushima Daiichi accident from the perspective of âstructural disasterâ as defined above. To understand the social context of this hidden prewar accident, it is necessary to move away from the current social condition of the post-Fukushima situation to the prewar wartime mobilization of science and technology, within which the clarification of this hidden accident can be properly pursued. After the clarification, we will move back to the current situation surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi accident, to present the sociological implications of the hidden accident for the Fukushima Daiichi accident and for potential future extreme events. 1 For a sociological investigation into the relationships between the Chernobyl and Wind scale"
224,219,0.382,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"of socio-ecological change lies the relationship between the population and natural resources, although they understood the relationship between the two variables differently. This reconciliation must be founded on the acknowledgement that both the population and the stock of resources are mutually dependent. The arguments proposed by Boserup should be expanded with two decisive contributions of the Malthusian tradition: on the one hand, the acknowledgement that natural resources are finite and that the possibilities for transformation are limited; and on the other hand, that social systems have not stopped growing since they first appeared. Precisely for that reason, reconciliation would entail assuming a more complex vision of population growth that does not only consider demographic components but also their level of consumption and the ways in which they relate to one another. Ultimately, the intensification of production can lead to the generalisation of unsustainable management practices and, therefore, to soil degradation. However, this is not a linear process; instead, it responds to the conditions established in each metabolic regime. In this respect, the case study examined here allows us to identify two key phases in this process. The first phase was in the late nineteenth century, when erosion reached high levels, and nutrients were mined, which would have ensured sustainability in the medium term. The second phase was in the final few decades of the twentieth century, when soil losses were greatest and over-fertilisation appeared as one of the most serious environmental problems in the history of agriculture. The first phase was the result of the exhaustion of productive possibilities within a still organic or solar agrarian metabolic regime, which was therefore incapable of meeting the needs of the entire population, especially the poorest peasants. The agrarian liberal reforms favoured access to land for a very large group of peasants, and thus fostered population growth. Both factors, in the context of a solar energybased economy (Sieferle 2001), forced productive intensity14 to unsustainable levels. Although the development of a Boserupian strategy can be perceived over the course of the nineteenth century through the intensification of farming land, for example, by reducing fallow, this did not prevent the situation from later bordering on a Malthusian crisis, which resulted in sharp declines in biological standards of living and emigration (CÃ¡mara 2007). In the late twentieth century, in contrast, within the context of an industrial metabolic regime and with a declining population, the pressure on the agro-ecosystem of MontefrÃ­o increased to levels hitherto unseen. The current economic situation of the sector, in which farmers are losing purchasing power, has been an incentive to opt for more invasive technologies, which in theory would allow them to multiply yields whilst saving on labour (Beaufoy 2001), following a pattern repeated elsewhere (Ananda and Herath 2003). The lack of adequate compensation for the costs derived from introducing plant cover also explains why the use of weed killers and the overuse of nitrogenous fertilisers continue to occur in spite of the negative effects on the soil."

182,266,0.382,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"During the first two decades of his career, Schwabe tracked E. granulosus across multiple boundaries. Where the parasite wentâfrom host to host, environment to environment, continent to continent and discipline to disciplineâso too did Schwabe, creating professional connections that brought the tapewormâs movements and exchanges into relief. When Schwabe made the leap from studying parasites in the context of nonhuman bodies and the laboratory to studying parasites in human bodies and human cultural niches, it was not so much a leap, in fact, but a transition guided by the parasitic animal itself, and an extension of its biological autonomy. The network of scientists and medical practitioners that collaborated with Schwabe, engaging in the global effort to investigate human and animal health, can also be seen as an extension of the interactive biological networks forged by the parasite. Schwabeâs graduate students and collaborators would become vital additions to those organizations that strove to track and prevent the spread of disease, from the Centres for Disease Control to the Pan American Health Organization.73"
164,39,0.382,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Of course the marginality framework developed and explored here should ultimately help reduce marginality and enhance the opportunities of marginalized people, be they women, ethnic minorities, the disabled, or some otherwise excluded group. At intermediate stages it should help frame action and assist pertinent actors (i.e., marginalized communities to gain more recognition and voice, or policy advisors, program designers and researchers to facilitate focused initiatives). This book not only provides evidence and insights of promising and innovative concepts and approaches, but also provides examples for revitalizing the poverty discourse and triggering action for change. Focusing merely on the income dimensions of poverty will not address its root causes shaped by marginality. Marginalization appears to be very difficult to reverse once complex systems have produced such a state, but the âpoverty trapâ concept offers limited insights for action, compared to human-environmental interrelationships as conceptualized in socio-ecological systems (SESs). One way to overcome marginalization is to increase the resilience and adaptability of SESs, however, multiple needs must be considered simultaneously, mainly: food security, income generation, and ecosystem services. Creating incentives for economic growth works well mostly for those who already have access to assets or have been reached by employment creation and service expansion efforts, but not for those excluded from them, whether for reasons"
284,61,0.381,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"A Latin American ecosocialism? In the 1980s, new ideas about socioecological politics in Latin America emerged. Authors such as Victor Toledo, Enrique Leff, JosÃ© Augusto PÃ¡dua and Ivan Restrepo formulated more radical ideas about the political context of environmental governance. Augusto Angel Mayaâs explicit message (1996, 2002) was to avoid interpreting environmental problems as exclusively ecological or technological. He understood the environment as an object of study in all the scientiï¬c disciplines, from the natural sciences and technologies to sciences that study human behaviour. Beginning in the 1980s, activist groups such as the Political Ecology Institute (Instituto de EcologÃ­a PolÃ­tica) in Chile, Censat in Colombia, Ecological Action (AcciÃ³n Ecologica) in Ecuador (composed of young female biologists), REDES (Amigos de la Tierra Uruguay/Friends of the Earth) in Uruguay, FASE (FederaÃ§Ã£o de ÃrgÃ£os para AssistÃªncia Social e Educacional/ Federation of Organizations for Social and Educational Assistance) in Brazil with Julianna Malerba, and others have emerged. There is a strong Latin American environmental thinking that enumerates, and denounces the multitude of environmental conï¬icts that the growth of the social metabolism brings with it. Some 20 years later, these views have not only been expressed in writings and manifestos of social actors and alternative thinkers of post-developmentalism, of agroecology and of popular environmentalism, but also in some national constitutions, in the discourses of government ofï¬cials and even by some ministers. After the defeat in 2005 of the US plans to promote the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), new leftwing, progressive governments emerged with the electoral victories of Evo Morales in Bolivia (2005) and Rafael Correa in Ecuador (2006). In the following years it even seemed that an international âofï¬cialâ environmental leadership could arise from South America. The Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008, for example, has been a very important symbol of environmental thinking in Latin America, with the presence of Alberto Acosta â ex-president of the Constituent Assembly â in a multitude of forums. Another example was the radical speech of Ecuador representative FÃ¡nder FalconÃ­, at the failed climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009, when he made reference to the ecological debt or climate debt of the North with the South. He compared the poor countries with âpassive smokersâ and he defended the Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) initiative to âleave the oil below groundâ in front of more than 150 presidents of state and leaders of government.8"
169,19,0.381,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Sometimes such feedbacks reinforce one another in ways difï¬cult to change. When such histories of relations eliminate novelty based on new information or innovation, then management becomes path dependent (David 1988; Arthur 1994; Page 2006), i.e., locked into previous decisions, and it loses the initiative to adapt to changes (Barnett et al. 2015). For example, if the history of investment in the science and technology of dam and dike infrastructure makes it unthinkable to open such barriers as part of managing for droughts or ï¬oods, this constricts the range of options for research and policy. It is as if the way forward for science or managers can only proceed along a narrow set of rails. These constraints hamper our attempts to experiment by moving laterally. This inertia from path dependence can be especially challenging for managers who seek to experimentally develop policies to address uncertainty arising from the dynamism of nature and/or society. In response to such challenges, decades of experimentation have produced a range of tools to engage these twin challenges and make decision-making and policy formulation more ï¬exible and comprehensive (Gunderson et al. 1995). This book reports on the opportunities afforded by these new approaches under the general rubric of adaptive management and governance."

365,340,0.38,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Together these pieces of evidence in turn provoke the question: Can insurance costeffectively mitigate the increasingly deleterious impacts of climate risk on poverty and food insecurity? Two inter-related claims suggest an affirmative answer to this question: 1. After a shock is realized (ex post), insurance payments should help families maintain their economic assets (physical and human) and their long-term economic viability. In simpler terms, insurance should help families avoid a (potentially inter-generational) poverty trap. 2. Because it increases ex post security, insurance should also have an ex ante effect through increasing the expected level and certainty of returns to investment. This ex ante ârisk reduction dividendâ should allow more families to escape poverty and food insecurity. Taken together these two arguments suggest that insurance can be a cost-effective instrument to address food insecurity in the face of climate change. As opposed to a policy that simply treats the casualties of climate shocks with, say, food aid transfers, an integrated policy that includes an insurance element may reduce the total required social protection expenditures by addressing the causes, not just the symptoms, of food insecurity. Such an integrated policy cost effective if it allows more more households to maintain and achieve economic viability so that they can take care of their own needs. The goal of this paper is to interrogate these claims and reflect on obstacles that may limit the efficacy of insurance as an instrument to manage climate risk. To do this, we proceed in several stages. First, in Sect. 1, we use recent theoretical modeling to explore the relative cost effectiveness of insurance as a device to manage the food insecurity induced by climate change. This modeling exercise assumes that: â¢ A contract can be designed that offers quality protection to inured individuals (i.e., insurance payouts correlate well with household losses) and avoids the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection that can undercut the commercial sustainability of insurance; â¢ Households understand and trust the insurance and make purchase decisions based on a standard model of economic rationality; and, â¢ Insurance is commercially priced at the same proportionate levels observed in US crop insurance markets (128% of the actuarially fair price). Under these assumptions, we find that while the logic outlined above holds and that integrated social protection, which employs an insurance element, can be a part of smart public policy, especially in the face or climate change. We do find that the relative benefits of an integrated social protection begins to weaken as climate change worsens and insurance itself becomes increasingly expensive. While the theoretical case for insurance-augmented integrated social protection is clear, can it work in practiceâthat is, can the three conditions assumed by the theoretical analysis be met in practice? To provide insight into this question, we then turn to a specific case studyâlivestock insurance in the pastoral regions of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopiaâto consider the practical barriers that limit"
223,106,0.38,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"To the budding geographer the time-bound message could not be misunderstood: Capture the power of social relations in a net of scientific laws and then, like your friends in physics, chemistry, and medicine, you too will have acquired the means not merely for understanding the world but for changing it as well. If the natural scientists know how to construct rockets that take them to the moon, if they know how to generate energy by enriching uranium, if they know how to save lives by transplanting hearts, then your duty as a social scientist is to discover similar techniques for eradicating poverty! Before you accept that challenge, though, be sure to ask yourself first why no one now reads Plato and Aristotle for what they had to say about physics or medicine, then why so many continue to return to the plays of Sophocles and Shakespeare for their insights into the human condition of hopes and fears, love and hate. How does the circumstance that we have accumulated knowledge in some areas and not in others relate to Aristotleâs remark that we should look for precision in each class of things just as far as the nature of the subject admits and that it would be equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician as to demand scientific proofs from a rhetorician? No small order given to a young man inexperienced in the actions that occur in life and therefore prone to pursue each object as passion directs. And yet, how could I possibly have ignored the challenge? GO ON, GO ON. The list of required readings included the classics of location theory, cognitive science, decision theory, systems analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, spatial statistics, and a sprinkle of historical geography, all of it somehow yoked together in Walter Isardâs conception of Regional Science and its extension into Peace Science, the latter firmly anchored in the Quaker-thin interface of scientific knowledge and political action, John Deweyâs pragmatism and the collections of the Barnes Foundation never far away. A formative experience it was, the handsome fellowship that in 1963â1964 took me to North Armorica and the intellectual hubs of the Wharton School, Berkeley, and Northwestern. Great. Yet, in hindsight, the seeds might well have been planted 10 years earlier by the odd gymnasium teacher who did whatever he could to introduce his rowdy pupils to the concentric rings of von ThÃ¼nenâs isolated state and the cost curves of Alfred Weberâs isodapanes. Perhaps I was the only one to pay attention, but the truth is that I can still feel in my body the boyâs excitement when he literally saw why there were so many gauchos on the Pampas and so many steel mills along the Ruhr. The rhetorical power of geometric construction on the high wire, von ThÃ¼nenâs agricultural landscape depicted as an archerâs target with the bullâs eye as the central city on a homogeneous plain (more correctly the Junkerâs own estate), Weberâs factory finding its place of least cost, the Archimedean point that is located at the center of a Euclidean triangle whose corners are the concepts of transportation, labor, and agglomeration. Deep roots it has, the subsequent definition of geography as a geometry with names, essentially an exercise in the drawing and baptizing of points, lines, and planes.

Finding a balance between the needs for bat conservation, sustainable harvesting and public health management is an important approach in the regions where regulated bat hunting is a goal (Halstead 1977). Change in perceptions and attitudes towards conservation and wildlife in general require an effective outreach approach. Thus, education and public awareness projects should be designed to engage the audience as has been demonstrated to be effective in Madagascar (Racey 2013) and Latin America (Navarro 2013). The involvement of all stakeholders and policy makers in conservation outreach projects is crucial to the effectiveness of education programs by facilitating the enactment and enforcement of protective legislation (Robinson et al. 2010)."

The factors involved in other legislation and policy development are ordinarily rather different (South Africa is a key exception here, because of its unique circumstances at the end of the apartheid era), and it is therefore more difficult to interpret the relationship between the two elements of governance. A systematic review of policy development and correlative legal frameworks has not been done in relation to ecosystem services, and making firm inferences from such a study would be problematic as there are a multitude of factors that might have influence. Existing legislation may be adequate to support policy innovations or require merely a change in interpretation that can be manifested through operational guidelines (which would be invisible to such a study). Policy on the other hand may not require legislative intervention in order to achieve its objectives. There is also a question of breadth or scope. If principles of human behaviour can be established that are generally adhered to, for example, in national Constitutions (e.g. with respect to human rights in the case of Bangladesh and the adherence to international standards in law at least), it may be that no further change is needed. This is not the case with respect to the management of resources, for instance, where changing management practices are driven in part by increased understanding through science, the application of technology, involvement of broader swathes of stakeholders and potentially also changing resource availability (as a result, for instance, of demographic changes or the impacts of climate change). One consequence of this is that it becomes increasingly difficult for legal practice to keep up with societal change. Furthermore, the development of legislation is in some ways intrinsically more contentious than the development of policy simply because of the power structures inherent in legislatures. Policy puts objectives in place that are generally non-enforceable, while law (at least in theory) puts obligations and rights in place that are supposed to be backed by official sanction."
192,200,0.379,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"During his (initially quite unsuccessful) research there, he coincidentally discovers a strange invisible âsomethingâ, a mysterious âprinciple Xâ which destroys bacteria, and he decides to study it meticulously, in accordance with the rigorous methods of his mentor. Unfortunately, while Martin is still engrossed in his analyses, experiencing serious inhibitions when it comes to putting his findings to paper, Felix dâHerelle of the Pasteur Institute announces his discovery of what he refers to as the âbacteriumâeatingâ virus, the bacteriophage. After recovering from this serious drawback (the loss of priority), Martin is urged by Gottlieb to continue his phage research, but to focus on practical applications instead, using these predators of bacteria as âalliesâ in the war against disease. When the fictitious Caribbean island of St. Hubert is struck with bubonic plague, and McGurk is called upon for help, Martin is sent there (accompanied by his wife Leora and a drinking companion, the public health specialist Sondelius) to conduct a field trial designed to determine whether âphageâ can effectively be employed in fighting lethal pathogens. The result is a moral clash between the islandâs administrators (who had expected a lifeâsaving doctor) and Martinâs own objective as a scientist, intent on using the population as âmaterialâ for his trial. Thus, he finds himself confronted with an ethical dilemma: as a physician, it is his duty to vaccinate as many inhabitants as possible, but as a researcher, he is in need of an (untreated) control group to demonstrate the effectiveness of his vaccine. This means: dividing the coloured, illiterate population of a village into two equal halves: the saved and the doomed. Initially, he remains loyal to the experimental rigour instilled in him by Gottlieb, but after the tragic death of both Sondelius and his wife the physician in him gains the upper hand and he contaminates the experiment that was supposed to bring him everlasting fame. He still manages to publish his results, but tampers with his sloppy data so as to make his story sufficiently convincing. He becomes married again, this time to an affluent socialite widow who kindly provides him with a lavishly equipped laboratory of his own. Yet, utter dislike of the social life of the New York elite, in combination with marital unease, presses him to leave both wife and child behind and to escape to the wilderness of Vermont, where, together with another disgruntled colleague, he lives out his mania for âpureâ research, virtually undisturbed, in an isolated forest cabin. In the following sections, key dimensions of the novel will be subjected to a Lacanian reading, treating Martin Arrowsmith as a case study (Fallgeschichte). Successively, I will focus on: (a) the organisational and occupational hazards of a biomedical career; (b) the cupido sciendi of pure science as a âdivine madnessâ; (c) Martinâs grand moment of discovery (the bacteriophage as the intrusion of the ârealâ); (d) the core medicalâethical dilemma (the bacteriologist as a physician and as a researcher) and (e) cabin science: Martinâs escape to a reclusive, scientific Walden, the novelâs final act."

Lessening the impacts of future drought events typically requires the development of drought risk policies that emphasize a wide range of water conservation and early warning measures. Drought management techniques are often conditional on the severity of the drought. Identifying the actions to take and the thresholds indicating when to take them are best accomplished prior to a drought, as agreements among stakeholders are easier to obtain when individuals are not having to deal with the impacts of an ongoing drought. Drought impacts can be economic, environmental, and social. Economic impacts can include direct losses to agricultural and industrial users, losses in recreation, transportation, and energy sectors. Other indirect economic impacts can include resulting unemployment and loss of tax revenue to local, state, and federal governments. Environmental losses include damages to plant and animal species in natural habitats, and reduced air and water quality; an increase in forest and range ï¬res; the degradation of landscape quality; and possible soil erosion. These losses are difï¬cult to quantify, but growing public awareness and concern for environmental quality has forced public ofï¬cials to focus greater attention on them. Social impacts can involve public safety, health, conflicts among water users, and inequities in the distribution of impacts and disaster relief programs. As with all natural hazards, the economic impacts of drought are highly variable within and among economic sectors and geographic regions, producing a complex assortment of winners and losers with the occurrence of each disaster."
222,5,0.379,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The idea that preserving the environment as an asset, rather than an impediment to economic and social development, is both very old and very new. For most of human history, at least until the start of the Industrial Revolution, the benefits humans derived from the rest of nature were well recognised and embedded in various cultural rules and norms. Parts of forests, lakes, wetlands or mountains were often deemed sacred and off limits. But it is no coincidence that these sacred natural assets also supplied essential life-support services for the communities involved. This is in stark contrast to the post-industrial view in much of the Western world that nature is merely a pretty pictureânice to enjoy if you can afford it but not essential to the more important business of âgrowing the economyâ. Too often, when the issue of conservation of the environment has entered public or political discussions, it has been purported to come at a cost, and the discussion has been framed as âthe environment versus the economyâ. Probably the most important contribution of the widespread recognition of ecosystem services is that it reframes the relationship between humans and the rest of nature to be more consistent with what we know. A better understanding of the role of ecosystem services emphasises our natural assets as critical ingredients to inclusive wealth, well-being and sustainability. Sustaining and enhancing human well-being requires a balance of all of our assetsâindividual people, society, the built economy and ecosystems. This reframing of the way we look at ânatureâ is essential to solving the problem of how to build a sustainable and desirable future for humanityâa goal that we all share. The ecosystem services concept makes it abundantly clear that the choice of âthe environment versus the economyâ is a false choice. If the environment contributes significantly to human well-being, then it is a major contributor to the real economy and the choice becomes how to manage all our assets, including natural and human-made capital, more effectively and sustainably (Costanza et al. 2000). Interest in ecosystem services in both the research and policy communities has grown rapidly (Braat and de Groot 2012). As of this writing, over 18,000 journal articles have been published on this topic, according to SCOPUS, and the number is growing exponentially. The most highly cited of these (with over 7,000 citations in SCOPUS as of this writing) is one that I and 12 co-authors published in Nature in 1997 that estimated"
78,44,0.379,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"4. Though we cannot deny that this attempt has yielded unprecedented results, we must also acknowledge that at some point the processed information must be reintegrated in what Stiegler (pace Husserl) has called our own primary retention (individual memory), to acquire meaning and to be part of our lifeworld (Stiegler 2013). 5. It is important, then, to note that the computational era is rooted in the most extreme type of dichotomous thinking: that of constructing discrete, machine readable bits. To be human, here, means to remember that life is continuous and plural and experienced rather than calculated. 6. The second problem with a dichotomy is that it assumes jointly exhaustive alternatives, which entails that the pairs forming the dichotomy cover all there is to be said about whatever they aim to describe. In his pivotal âThe duality of risk assessmentâ, Ciborra (2004) has elucidated how the hidden presumption that e.g. a risk analysis exhaustively describes a developing reality endangers the resilience of whoever depends on that analysis to remain safe. 7. Smart Grids, policing, medical treatment or the food industry should never assume that the data derivatives that inform their risk analyses cover all that is relevant. To prevent the kind of havoc that plagues our financial system we must instead keep an open mind, assuming that the computational decision systems that feed such critical infrastructure are as biased and fallible as any smart system necessarily must be. To be human, here, means to admit such fallibility as core to the wondrous fragility of life. 8. An interesting example of a dichotomy that confuses instead of clarifies what it means to be human in the computational era, is the dualism that pervades the domain of the philosophy of mind. The cartesian idea of a separate res extensa and a separate res cogitans that together describe reality has given rise to a series of interrelated problems that still haunt much of our understanding of e.g. responsibility and accountability in a world of distributed causation. To overcome the confusion that results from this kind of dualism I believe that we should not merely turn to overlapping instead of mutually exclusive dual pairs, but take leave of the idea that reality should necessarily be described in pairs altogether. 9. Whether it makes sense to think in pairs or in other types of distinctions should depend on the context and the aim of our thinking, not on a propensity to keep things simple. I would, therefore, rearticulate the heading and speak of: Beyond dualities. Long live plurality.

198,305,0.379,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"acknowledging that processes affecting climate change take place in various interlinked scales, it is important to identify the relevant system boundaries pertinent to the evaluation. For this evaluation the targeted market/technology was the unit of the analysis and the system boundaries were set at the national scale. Attention was given to identifying various components, and to the interactions among these components or segments of the market targeted by the project. Special attention was given to identifying market barriers to change and how these barriers affect the functioning of the system and the systems likely emergent properties. orlen and Consults (n.d.), have analyzed changes in the status orlen (2014) and Wâ¬ of market barriers addressed by climate change mitigation projects, including those supported by the GEF. The evaluation built on their work to assess changes in targeted market barriers and factors contributing to change. Subsequent steps focused on assessing the extent and the way in which specific elements of the interventionâs theory of change interacted with elements of the system (Mayne 2008). The focus of enquiry was on how the intervention became part of the system and the changes (intended or unintended) which this brought about (Garcia and Zazueta 2015). This perspective seeks to emphasize the interconnectedness of the intervention and elements of the system unlike other contextual perspectives that emphasize the effects of context on the intervention (Pawson et al. 2004; Blamey and Mackenzie 2007). This approach was woven into the instruments, which were designed to gather information on the GEF activities and on the links of these activities to support provided by other actors that were relevant to the targeted market. The instruments also took into account the extent the activities undertaken by the other actors were influenced by the GEF support and vice-versa. The decision to restrict the system boundaries at the national scale was influenced by the fact that flow of information and learning is easier, and policy framework more consistent, within the national boundaries. Similarly, barriers related to suppliers, finance and expertise are more consistent within a country than among countries. GEF projects too are generally geared towards influencing the targeted markets at the national scale (Eberhard and Tokle 2004). This, however, does not mean that the systems at the national scale are insular and may not be affected by factors that have origins in other countries. The evaluation itself documented three instances â ILUMEX (GEF 575), BRT (GEF 1155) and Landfill (GEF 784) in Mexico which had been replicated/scaled up in other Latin-American countries."

In this section we consider the key drivers and objectives for the STI partnership, their relative importance, as well as the differences on the African and European sides. The Global Consensus on Science and Technology We referred in the previous section to an emerging global consensus in the first decade of the twenty-first century on the role of STI in development, and to the explicit inclusion in the Treaty of Lisbon to an objective of building the EUâs scientific and technological bases. In short, the widespread acceptance that capacity in scientific and technological research, and in innovation, offered a route to industrial competitiveness, to economic growth, to sustainable development and to poverty alleviation provided a robust and timely argument to the architects of JAES for a chapter on science for sustainable development that was hard to refute. Thus, despite a shortage of resources, S&T together with space, and information and communication technologies found their place in the JAES as instruments of sustainable development alongside traditional domains for international political relations such as democracy, governance, human rights, peace and security."

Small scale hydroelectric and solar systems can reduce emissions, enable adaptation and help local livelihoods although there are numerous problems that limit the success of projects including poor design, inequitable distribution of benefits, negative user perceptions, and poorly designed or non-existent governance and maintenance structures. Although the design of some case study projects did not allow for the triple objective to be currently met, this does not preclude the projects from meeting it in the future. In some projects, a proper PAR analysis wasnât carried out as there were no extreme weather events reported or any other emergency that showed the usefulness, robustness or vulnerability of the technology or of the population thanks to the infrastructure. Indeed, some DRE projects can be more robust, and some have already been rebuilt after specific extreme weather events. Some users indicated that their systems could still be working had the local donor or implementing NGO been more aware and visited more often and not disappeared. This points to the need for greater and better monitoring as well as evaluation, which hadnât been carried out in some of the projects visited, despite their being implemented for more than 5 years. Table 11.5 gives a summary of the results of all the case studies, according to each major category of indicators. The notes below explain in greater detail the concept of each column."
214,486,0.378,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"One way of describing the philosophy of a climate model is that a global climate model bounds each and every process by physical laws, starting from the conservation of energy and mass. From this constrained set of budget equations, combined with different representations of the processes (like condensation in clouds), complex results emerge. But these results have to be compatible with the physical laws (like conservation of mass, or the equations governing fluid flow on a rotating sphere). The emergent complexity is a reflection of reality. The physical laws behind climate models are well known and observed. The most recent ânewâ theories are well over 100 years old. They are also the same physical laws that govern many other ï¬elds of science and engineering. The description of the motion of fluids in the atmosphere and ocean are the same equations used to build numerical models of how an airplane will perform. The equations that govern the flow of energy in the climate system from the sun, through the atmosphere to the earth, and then back are the same equations describing how cellular phones and radios work."
164,558,0.378,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were being set in 2000â2001 social protection was barely mentioned. Ten years later in 2010 at the United Nations âMDGs + 10 Summit,â sessions on every one of the eight goals referenced social protection programs as a means of achieving poverty reduction targets.2 In the short term, well-designed social protection programs reduce poverty levels and ameliorate related suffering, particularly among the poorest (Barrientos and Hulme 2008). In the mid-term they allow many poor people to exercise their agency and pursue micro-level plans to increase their productivity and income. In the longer term, they create a generation of healthier and better educated people who can seize economic opportunities and contribute to broad-based economic growth. Additionally, when sudden crises spread across the worldâas with the 2008 triple whammy of global food, fuel and financial crisesâthese programs help poor families cope with the unpredicted consequences of globalization. Expanding across the Global South is a heterodox analysis that sees welldesigned social protection schemes as contributing to several goals at the same time. Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, Indonesia, and China are paving the way, but the idea is spreading via a genuinely southern revolution.3 The focus is on trusting the poor to use money wisely and to pursue objectives that poor people already want to doâsend their children to school, improve their diet, and make small investments to increase their income. Cash transfers work especially well when money is targeted at a relatively large group of people and is perceived as social assistance. Aid donors from developed nations, now calling themselves development partners, have responded after seeing that cash transfers have become an important part of social protection and increasingly recognize them as a legitimate development strategy. Aid donors and some elites in developing countries (especially ministers of finance and business elites), however, have much less trust in the poor. They tend to use terms like âsafety nets,â âhandouts,â and âdolesâ derogatorily, and to view transfers as temporary or short-term solutions, rather than strategic elements that can help raise agricultural productivity, support micro-enterprise, and foster economic activity in marginalized regions. From the USA, where the poor are often blamed for their poverty, the tendency is to emphasize the centrality of conditionsâsuch as school attendance for recipientsâ children or engaging in public serviceârather than to recognize conditionality as one design element of a program. Some programs work better with conditionality while others do not. Schady, one of the authors of the World Bank report Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) is a strong advocate of conditions because he is convinced that the problem is the âpersistently misguided beliefsâ of the poor (Fizbein and Schady 2009, 9).4 Indeed in the USA, many specialists are not aware that unconditional cash transfers are a major element of social Hulme attended the MDGs + 10 Summit and witnessed this by agencies keen to incorporate social protection, social floors, and conditional cash transfers into future strategies. During the preparation of this manuscript Hulme was working with the government of Bangladesh on a national social protection strategy and the Asian Development Bank reviewing the âsilent revolutionâ of social protection policy that has swept across Asia.

Such options include second-generation technologies and the use of by-products and waste products for bioenergy production. Both energy and food prices fell considerably after 2010, and they also became more volatile as compared to the 1990s (Kalkuhl et al. 2016). The development of the oil price remains difficult to project (Baumeister and Kilian 2016), but in view of the prevailing low oil prices, scarcity of oil was no longer a prominent argument for the resource substitution perspective (Table 3.1). Climate protection became the major argument for substituting fossil-based resources. While this argument was not new (e.g. WBGU 2011), the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change became a major rationale for resource substitution (see Table 3.1). While resource substitution, thus, remains important, the emphasis has shifted to the biotechnology innovation perspective of the bioeconomy. Accordingly, the opportunity to make economic use of innovations in biotechnology and, more generally, in the life sciences has become a major rationale for the bioeconomy in recent years. An example for this shift in perspective is a Strategy Paper published by the German Federal Bioeconomy Council in May 2014, which includes the following section: Originally, the concept of a biobased economy was promoted in the light of expected rapidly depleting petrol, gas and coal reserves. However, the move into bioeconomy is no longer driven predominantly by expectations of rising prices of fossil fuels. In view of the exploitation of new fossil reserves and due to energy efficiency improvements, this argument has become less pressing but it nevertheless remains strategically essential. Without major adjustments, the continued emission of greenhouse gases and the related changes in climate conditions will irreversibly damage the global ecosystem and will involve incalculable economic risks.

The idea that âcivilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable directionâ also was incorporated into major segments of the social sciences (Ross 2001). Their core assumption is that we can recast the social world in line with our values and ambitions. Thus, according to Keynesian economics, if one correctly sets interest rates and the rates at which people spend and save, one can achieve high economic growth. Sociologists in the post-World War II era held that Head Start, Medicaid, negative income tax, Social Security, and half a dozen other such federal programs will allow us to close the gap between the races and the classes. These were indeed heady, optimistic ages, captured in such mottos as âwhere there is a will there is a wayâ and in assertions that âthe richest nation of the world should be ableâ to accomplish whatever was needed."

The above lessons have been derived and documented by working with the communities in the region which brings out a clear need for a robust disaster risk reduction mechanism having a potential to minimize disaster risk for the communities living at the frontlines. The Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)2 promotes such a people-centred approach to early warning as one of the priority areas for communities to avoid risks. The objective of people-centred early warning systems is to empower individuals and communities threatened by hazards to act in sufficient time and in an appropriate manner so as to reduce the possibility of personal injury, loss of life, damage to property and the environment and loss of livelihoods The underpinning assumption is that this requires strong community participation on the ground and enabling environment for greater cooperation across various stakeholders including the government authorities in India and Nepal across levels on knowledge and information sharing. As it is known that the resilience agenda could also move to become a more integral part of ongoing local development processes, so it would be appropriate to look into the above processes and policies in the mainstream development planning."

A CIsâ disruptions scenario is simply a sequence of random events following a well-deï¬ned chronological order. Generally, each identiï¬ed scenario produces a set of consequences which is a function of: the initiating event, the concerned CIs and the geo-organizational context of the disrupted CIs. Formal sciences represent the reality of our surrounding world. But formal sciences are imperfect and what we call ârealityâ is the projection of the inaccessible âRealityâ on our world. This projection is the only reality we are talking about in formal sciences. Subsequently, formal sciences construct objects in which small parts of the sensible reality are grasped and formalized. These objects can be called âmodelsâ. We are limiting our interest here to formal sciences and engineering activities that cover both conceptual and phenomenological modelling processes. Models are ï¬rst validated before being admitted in the construction of a global model of the sensible reality. Regarding our focus on crisis scenarios modelling, simulation and analysis (MS&A), engineersâ ambition is to simulate not only independent isolated phenomenon but also interacting multi-physic multi-scale phenomenon."

284,14,0.377,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Environmental governance as a ï¬eld of inquiry Environmental governance offers an analytical perspective that combines socioenvironmental research with development-oriented governance research (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006). Socioenvironmental research addresses the interplay between environmental and social change. In this context, as in this introductory chapter, the social dimension is broadly deï¬ned, also encompassing cultural, economic, political and institutional relations. Governance research addresses the way in which society organizes itself in order to solve its dilemmas and create new opportunities. Until the 1980s, social scientists working in Latin American countries focused on concepts of governability as the region faced unstable political conditions and structural challenges such as inequality, violence, corruption and limited citizenship. However, the growing emphasis on formal institutions and market-driven mechanisms of neoliberal governance quickly attracted the attention of social scientists to a perspective of governance as a social process that inï¬uences the level of governability (Kooiman, 2003). This perspective criticized the normative perspective of âgood governanceâ introduced by the World Bank in the seminal report Governance and Development (1992). According to this document, the solution to overcome underdevelopment should be self-governance. The World Bank proposed a roadmap to achieve so-called good governance based on three pillars: a âsmall stateâ through deregulation; âmarket incentivesâ though privatization and liberalization; and âparticipationâ through decentralization and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Subsequent World Bank reports further elaborated this international agenda, stressing in a rather technocratic approach, the need for effective state institutions to achieve development in a global context of liberalized markets (Demmers, FernÃ¡ndez Jilberto and Hogenboom, 2004). Alternatively, social science scholars use (environmental) governance to emphasize social relations and, in particular, the tension between conservation and development goals in order to understand the interplay among social, institutional and environmental change. The environmental governance research builds on a range of theoretical schools, including new institutionalism (Ostrom, 1990; Young, 1999; Biermann and Pattberg, 2008), sociopolitical studies (Kooiman et al., 2005; Lemos and Agrawal, 2006) and sociocultural approaches (Cleaver, 2002; Alimonda and GandÃ¡segui, 2006; Castro, 2008; Gudynas, 2011). Despite their different theoretical and methodological stands (see Castro, 2013), they all address social behaviour towards natural"
273,51,0.377,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"First and foremost, the traditional economic development pattern focusing solely on economic growth is the immediate cause of environmental issues. History shows that after the Industrial Revolution, countries like UK, USA and Germany have created miracles of rapid economic development, but accompanied with the global environmental issues that threaten human development. This is because the traditional economic development pattern focused more on the achievements made in economic sphere with primary target at pursuit of growth in total output value and economic profit and increase of material wealth. Under such traditional pattern, people sacrificed resource consumption and environment damage in return for economic growth, regardless of resource utilization efficiency; ecosystem is exposed to destruction because of lack of rational resource development and utilization. On one hand, development and utilization of renewable resources went beyond the limit of regeneration rate of resources and even beyond the development level of their substitutes, with ever increasing consumption of non-renewable resources. On the other hand, owing to weak awareness of ecological environment protection and pursuit of economic interest maximization, low-cost production methods that are harmful were adopted, having no regard for pollution-free technologies and scientific environmental resource management. Such development pattern has directly led to increasingly severe environmental problems worldwide. Just as Engels pointed out in Dialectics of Nature, âLet us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such conquest takes its revenge on us. Each of them, it is true, has in the first place the consequences on which we counted, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel out the first.â8 Secondly, capitalist system in developed countries and the inequitable international order under that system are the root causes for global environmental problems. Under capitalism, environment does not exist as a natural domain where humankind must coexist with other species, but as a domain to be developed in the"
34,1293,0.376,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","14.1 INTRODUCTION How could the environmental health of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf or GoM) be described in regard to fish kills, diseases, and parasitic infections before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? This might seem like a simple question, but the answer is complex and difficult to report. Nevertheless, reporting some of that complexity is the aim of this chapter. Many people consider the GoM to be restricted to the offshore waters, but studies on diseases in offshore water deeper than 200 meters [m] (656 feet [ft]) are few, not very detailed, incomplete, and not necessarily representative of the entire Gulf. Looking at offshore fishes in the Gulf, one should also consider the nursery grounds for those species. These grounds are usually the estuaries of the Gulf. Moreover, these estuaries are independent habitats that provide important aspects of understanding mortality and diseases of animals throughout the entire Gulf. This chapter treats the entire GoM. Several factors have been impediments to research on this topic. An important reason for not being able to fully understand disease and its importance to the GoM involves the fact that when fishes become ill or otherwise stressed, they usually get preyed upon by predators and microbial consumers. Moreover, many diseases primarily affect the larval stages of the hosts, and individuals of these stages are so small that they are usually overlooked and seldom critically examined. When someone sees infected individuals, disease conditions may not necessarily be apparent. Infections in larval fishes by one or few individuals of a parasite species can have a role in disease epidemics. Observations of such cases can be supported by experimental laboratory studies. One critical reason that diseases in the Gulf of Mexico prior to the oil spill are not well-known is because some cutting-edge molecular diagnostic tools have been developed only recently and have not been widely applied for diagnosis of marine animal diseases. Another reason why diseases of offshore fishes as well as shellfishes, other invertebrates, marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds have not been studied relates to the high expense of collecting and studying the material. For example, charges for daily rental of large research ships can be as much as $50,000; the 29.7 m (97.4 ft) USM-GCRL R/V Tommy Munro, on which research involving the continental shelf is conducted, presently costs $7,200 plus the cost of fuel. Some of our past research has avoided high collecting costs because we took advantage of various inshore and offshore studies of fishes conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) by partaking in its cruises, by accompanying other biologists on their trips, by obtaining parasites from some fishes collected by others, by conducting numerous inshore and offshore collection activities from our own small vessels, by assessing diseases, and most importantly, by utilizing the vast array of literature reflecting research conducted by others."

284,5,0.376,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Preface This book is the result of the collaborative research project Environmental Governance in Latin America (ENGOV) funded by the European Union (EU). For four years, a team of experts from ten Latin American and European academic institutions investigated how environmental governance is currently being shaped in Latin America. In this joint effort, we were driven by our concerns about widespread ecological degradation, poverty and injustice, as well as by our curiosity about the ways in which the emergence of new political regimes and elites, and innovative steps by communities and social organizations, affects governance practices and natureâsociety relations. To understand the possibilities and obstacles for sustainable and equitable natural resource use, a range of case-studies were carried out in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico. Although some of the research topics and cases are not included in this volume, their ï¬ndings have contributed to the discussions and theoretical reï¬ections in the overall analysis. The ENGOV project has been simultaneously challenging and inspiring. The theme of environmental governance is a huge academic enterprise because it addresses complex social relations, practices and views inï¬uencing how societies perceive nature and use natural resources. Combining methods and theories from different ï¬elds of the social sciences is a prerequisite which in practice is fairly demanding. Furthermore, by encompassing political, economic, cultural and environmental changes, formal as well as informal arrangements, and cross-scale connections, the study of environmental governance can easily become a âmission impossibleâ. Arguably this is even more the case for contemporary Latin America, with its variety of local and national conditions facing rapid-paced changes. Finally, collaborating in an international research consortium of ten institutional partners and more than 25 researchers from different disciplines, schools of thought and generations has also proved to be both daring and rewarding. The fact that we spoke in different academic languages and idiom accents was not only a hurdle to tackle during our group discussions, but also forced us to learn from each otherâs approaches and convictions, and the foundations on which these are based. As a typical governance process, next"

365,105,0.375,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Local collective action for improved input use and management Management practices like IPM, SLM and improved input use efficiency require a knowledge base that is shared by many farmers. For example, both IPM and improved water use efficiency rely on weather information that may be collected by regional weather stations. Developing strategies to address crop diseases as well as controlling buildup of resistance to pest control will require collective action. Effective land use management should take into account externalities among crops and other production activities within a region. Therefore, development of regional institutions for collaboration that will allow for the provision of public goods and capturing economies of scale among small producers will be of high value. Poteete, Janssen, and Ostrom (2010) provide multiple forms of institutions to address various collective action challenges in the development context, but different situations may require different solutions and there are many opportunities for innovative institutional designs to address emerging climate change challenges. Insurance Products The decreased stability of weather due to climate change raises the value of risk management strategies. For example, Mendelsohn (2006) suggests that crop insurance can be a good strategy to cope with increased risk. Golden et al. (2007) suggest that using weather derivatives and similar financial instruments can be an effective mechanism to address climate change related risk. The story of Joseph in the Bible illustrates the role of inventory as mitigating weather variability; similarly, there is a large literature on the economics of storage management in agriculture (Williams and Wright 2005) that applies to increased weather instability."

222,86,0.375,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The approach adopted in this research to understanding povertyenvironment linkages is novel in four key ways. First, it takes an integrated, systems approach that considers interactions, feedbacks and trade-offs, which is missing in most analyses (Dempsey and Robertson 2012). Second, the research considers many different epistemic approaches including the consideration of poverty-environment linkages from multiple methodological and theoretical standpoints (Nicholls et al. 2016). Some of these are integrated within the modelling framework, while others provide richness and understanding to the findings. Third, the analysis is future oriented. It is not sufficient to understand present ecological determinants of well-being, without understanding the capacity for these systems or services to continue to generate wellbeing into the future under various political, social-economic and environmental scenarios. Finally, the outcome of the analysis is not an answer to a single question, but rather a process which provides key insights concerning associative and causal linkages that have the potential to untangle and answer a wide range of questions on poverty and the environment (Chap. 28). The research also describes a range of plausible future trajectories derived in a participatory manner. Hence, while the individual components of the analysis are interesting, the integration of these components is ground-breakingâfor example, the integration of social differentiation in rural settlements with biophysical outputs to model poverty through time based on changes in the natural environment."
180,307,0.374,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"considered to be a âtest caseâ in the discussion about the paternalism of âcollective decisionsâ (Dworkin 1988), appeals to paternalism point to water fluoridationâs benefits for entire communities (e.g., health needs of children, reduction in health risks and health inequalities). However, those who prioritize autonomy point out that water fluoridation intervenes in an important area of personal life without the consent of those affected, essentially coercing adults to lead healthy lives (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007). Despite the controversy, water fluoridation is âthe most celebrated exampleâ of âcollective action/efficiencyâ to justify public health programs and policies (Faden and Shebaya 2010). In deliberative democracies, governments tend to address the conflict between paternalism and autonomy by focusing on elements of procedural justiceârational explanations, transparency of the decision-making process, and involvement of individuals and stakeholder groups in decision making (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007). Greece, a coastal Mediterranean country in southeastern Europe, has nearly 11 million people. Among 12-year-olds, the average number of dental cariesâmeasured as the number of decayed, missing, or filled teethâis 2.07 per child (Kravitz and Treasure 2009). Public institutions such as universities, hospitals, and health centers of the National Health System provide limited oral health care. Most oral health care takes place in private clinics, where dental patients pay the entire cost of care. Oral health care constitutes an estimated one-third of the total expenditure on private health care in Greece (Kravitz and Treasure 2009). Since 2009, Greece has faced a severe fiscal crisis. In providing health care, public health authorities have to deal with severe budget limitations. The financial crisis is also straining the ability of individuals to pay for private sector dental treatment. The Greek central government regulates many public health programs, including oral disease prevention and oral health promotion policies, but implementation is local. Although the government mandated water fluoridation in 1974, as of 2013 the program had not been implemented because of diffuse public resistance to such interventions. In 2008, a special commission proposed to the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity to include water fluoridation in the national strategy for public health (Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity 2008). Given the long hiatus in implementing the program, reasonable questions could be raised about its justification, political legitimization, and social acceptance. A two-part study on these questions was carried out (Aspradaki 2012). It included interviews with key figures in the dental community from academia, the professions, and trade unions. It also included a systematic content analysis of all mentions of water fluoridation by the involved actors (e.g., dental professionals, policy makers) reported in the Journal of the Hellenic Dental Association for 1983 through 2011. The results showed strong skepticism among professionals about the programâs feasibilityâreflecting the publicâs concerns over this issue. Significant concerns were about a lack of technical infrastructure and organizational problems in the institutions that would implement water fluoridation. The vigorousness of the opposing arguments in the autonomy/paternalism debate in terms of justice, procedural justice, and public interest added to the skepticism. Concerns were also raised about the overall"

Globally, the freshwater that can be utilized by humankind only accounts for 0.325 % of the total water volume on Earth.

Discharge of household wastewater and industrial wastewater as well as surface runoff of agricultural pollutants like fertilizer and pesticide, is the leading cause for water pollution.

10,175,0.374,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"seen to be highly political and highly insensitive to the lived experiences of flooding recovery (Medd et al. 2014). After all, water is materially and socially a highly emotive subjectâwhether through its overabundance, its lack, or when polluted (Sultana 2011). As can be seen in the Somerset case, the use, control and conflicts around water shape peoples everyday experiences with water (Sultana 2011). Water in complex landscapes such as Somerset have substantial emotive aspects, as discussion of its control and use intersects with experiences of place, livelihoods, and social, economic, political and environmental futures. It is these futures that are directly being intervened with in both longer term planning (such as water resource management plans, drought plans), and emergency management and policies that emerge during and after periods of crisis. Whittle et al. (2012) have captured strongly the emotional work that occurs simultaneously to the practical work in restoring built and natural environments after a flooding event. Clearly then the discussion of the future of water scarcity for an area such as Somerset at a time when the whole region is concentrating on recovering from a period of water abundance is an emotive and contested conversation. Nonetheless, it is a fundamentally important one. Despite these restrictions in this broader governance system, the pilot measures initiated by a number of stakeholders in the Somerset region (cp. Sect. 5.3) demonstrate a positive example of the sorts of water management activities that can bridge across the policy silos of flood and drought even in a period of âdisaster recoveryâ. Far from just satisfying certain WFD requirements for participation and catchment management, these initiatives reflect concrete attempts to change the experiences of stakeholders and engagements with the breadth of water management issues facing their region now and into the future. These are highly politicised and emotive processesâthey tap into conversations about âwhat the Somerset Levels and Moors are forâ; highlighting conflicts between protection of people, agriculture and nature; and arguably reflect the ongoing entrenchment of neoliberal and meta-governance failures in relations to drought and water scarcity across England (Walker 2014). As Clout (2014) reflects, such conversations about the purpose of the Levelsâwhether to maintain agriculture or support nature conservationâare not new and they have probably been happening since the middle ages, when the area was ï¬rst drained and developed. Within this project and chapter, we can neither prescribe what the future of the Levels should be or what activities need to take place in order to continue opening up conversations about ways to bridge silos within water management activities within the region. However, we do call on leaders and stakeholders in the Somerset region to continue collaborative processes of water governance across the widest possible range of stakeholders. This will ensure that a diversity of views from these stakeholders are catalogued, when adaptation policies are developed across water policy domains. Hopefully, in this way broader meta-governance failuresâwhich often entrench siloed"

Finally these reports focussed on one of the key issues that arose in CSD-17 discussions â how to finance the transformative changes needed. The CSA work focused on the potential for linking the emerging and potentially huge new sources of climate finance â including but not limited to carbon markets â to support the transition to sustainable agriculture. However, important barriers such as high transactions costs for smallholder agricultural producers to access and benefit from climate finance were clearly identified as major issues (FAO 2011). The CSA concept sparked considerable attention and debate in international and national agricultural and climate change policy arenas, and it was quickly taken up as a rallying point for mobilizing actions on climate change and agriculture. In the wake of the Hague conference, two parallel global processes related to policy and science of CSA were established. The policy process involved follow up conferences in 2012 in Hanoi Vietnam and 2014 in Johannesburg South Africa. The global CSA science process was initiated with a global CSA science conference at Wageningen in 2011, with subsequent CSA science conferences held at University of California at Davis in 2013 and at CIRAD Montpelier in 2015. One of the main outcomes of these processes was the proposal to establish a global alliance on climate smart agriculture (GACSA) which would bridge the policy and science aspects by focussing on three key action areas: (1) knowledge; (2) enabling environment and (3) investments. After considerable debate, the GACSA was launched in September 2014 at the UN Climate Summit. Memberships in GACSA may include governments, civil society member/non-government organizations, farmers, fishers and forester organizations, intergovernmental organization (including UN entities), research/extension/education organizations, financing institutions and private sector organizations. As of January 2016 the GACSA has 122 members, including 22 countries. CSA developments were not only at international level however, with CSA projects initiated at country and regional levels, generally in partnership with international organizations such as FAO, World Bank, local and international NGOs and the Climate Change and Food Security program of the CGIAR. The rapid and widespread uptake of the CSA concept took place in advance of a clearly defined methodology and definition of CSA, and thus differences in meanings and application of the concept have arisen, and given rise to controversies, which further clarification and development of the CSA concept could ostensibly resolve. However much of the controversy around the CSA concept is related to more fundamental disagreements in global policy debates on climate change and sustainable agriculture."
182,142,0.373,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Working with the Edinburgh zoologist, Theodore Rettie, McGowan began in 1912 to investigate louping ill, which he saw as analogous to poliomyelitis in humans. He moved on to braxy (which he attributed to the same bacteria as louping ill), a type of jaundice he thought analogous to human cholera, and the obscure disease known as scrapie which was reportedly increasing in prevalence. His enquiries proceeded along established lines. Continuing to view diseased sheep as problems of place, he considered the local influences of season, pasture, weather patterns and landscape on their bodies. Working at the Edinburgh Lunacy Boardâs farm in Linlithgowshire, on private farms and in his laboratory at the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, he examined sheep clinically in life and by post-mortem after death, and conducted bacteriological experiments on their bodily tissues and fluids. Sheep both facilitated and impeded his enquiries in the ways outlined above. Landowners and farmers provided crucial assistance âin obtaining information regarding the occurrence of the disease, in procuring diseased animals for observation, and in other waysâ.90 His recommendations focused on the improvement of pasture, and the management of sheep grazing and breeding.91 In contrast, this approach was rarely adopted by the beneficiaries of BA and DC funding. Departing from the received view of sick sheep as products and shapers of unhealthy environments, they focused instead on sheep relationships with other infected and infective bodies. Believing that environments were unimportant, they sidelined the farmers and natural historians who knew about them, ignored the local specificities of vegetation, topography and sheep, and considered climate only in its effects on bacteria and parasites. They pursued their enquiries by extracting sheep and their infective agents, physically and conceptually from their specific farms of origin, and refashioning them within laboratories into generic subjects of investigation, which they hoped would produce universal knowledge of disease more readily than the locally specific sheep of the field. Zoologists and entomologists investigated different stages in the life cycles of parasitic mites and ticks by âfarmingâ them in glass tubes and incubators, and working out how changes in temperature and moisture"

36,413,0.373,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.6 Conclusion Bats harbour viruses that may become zoonotic. Circumstances facilitating spillover include direct contact with bats (bites, scratches, consumption of bats), contact with material contaminated by bat saliva, faeces or urine and amplification via intermediate hosts such as domestic animals or other wildlife species. Conservational actions are not only important to prevent spillovers, but also because emerging zoonotic viruses often lead to persecution of bats. In order to reduce the transmission risk of viruses from bats to human and livestock and to protect bat species at threat, educational efforts are needed. However, entrenched cultural and social components often act as barriers to efficient changes on how people think about and respond to bats. Whenever possible, educational efforts should be done in an informative, non-lurid way, presenting the facts rather than provoking additional fears to the already bad reputation of bats. Wherever possible, solutions should be found to enable the existence of bats in anthropogenic landscape, including the development of more affordable and readily available vaccinations (e.g. against rabies), and the reduction of potential contact between bats and humans and livestock. This however also includes that the natural habitats of bats need to be better protected to provide bat populations with sufficient space and to prevent range expansion into urban and suburban areas, where contact with humans and livestock may increase the risk of spillover events. Bat-borne viruses should be considered during bat conservation efforts, and it should be equally noticed that appropriate conservation measures may even reduce the risk of viral spillover from bat populations into human populations."
302,351,0.373,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"4 Risk Perception of Plastic Pollution and Political Actions Since the 2000s Plastic pollution research declined during the 1990s, only to drastically increase after it was verified during the 2000s that plastic was a ubiquitous marine pollutant [17]. Among several important publications, Thompson et al. [26] published a famous paper in science entitled âLost at sea: Where is all the plastic?â which is being recognized as a major driver for the elevated scientific interest [17]. The significant increase in scientific publications on the topic was followed with increased international media attention and political measures being enforced. Reports about the plastic pollution problem have thus been broadcasted in international media such as Reuters [27], and political measures have been taken in different regions of the world. In 2008 Rwanda banned the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags throughout the country [28]. This ban followed a"
183,343,0.373,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"early actions are the best to prevent loss of lives and to protect livelihoods andâafter the disaster has hitâwhich response actions to take. Decision-making in the preparedness and response phase should be based on factual data about the needs on the ground, but is in reality a highly political process. For example, damage and needs assessments are competitive and difficult processes as agencies continue to see information on the impact of a disaster as something to be âownedâ in order to leverage resources and influence rather than as something to be shared (Walton-Ellery and Rashid 2012). Responders also face âhigh levels of uncertainty, extreme stress with significant consequences of actions, compressed timelines and significant lack of information available initially followed by extreme information overloadâ (Preece et al. 2013). In the case of Typhoon Haiyan, for example, those responding considered the multitude of different information sources and formats generally as an information overload (Comes et al. 2013). Responders will have different degrees of data literacy and cognitive abilities to deal with these circumstances and to make sense of the data and information that is available and accessible to them. The degree of collective sensemaking that is reached among responders is another important factor in decision-making between and within organizations (Wolbers and Boersma 2013). Important in sensemaking is having reliable, accurate, and timely data. Getting such data right after a sudden onset disaster is challenging given the chaotic and disrupted situation. In the case of floods in Bangladesh, the working group on Disaster Emergency Response (part of the Local Consultative Group that coordinates between the Government of Bangladesh and the different development partners) established a Joint Needs Assessment project in 2014. The Joint Needs Assessment project started a large survey to collect data in the field given the absence of consistent, comparable information across the affected area, whereby they had to trade-off between time, quality, granularity, and available resources (Wahed et al. 2014). Harmonizing and coordinating the different assessments organizations are doing is a difficult task and heterogeneity issues in the data sets that come out of the assessments are most commonly unavoidable. Given these data-related challenges, it is evident that responders face information gaps. Whether it is not having enough information at the very onset of a disaster or whether it is having too much information later in the disaster; in both cases, their information needs are not adequately covered. These gaps will be more articulate in developing countriesâoften data poor and low techâthan in developed countries."
75,379,0.373,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","Research Dissemination: The Narrative A typical empirical scientific workflow goes something like this: a research experiment is designed to answer a question; data are collected, filtered, and readied for analysis; models are fit, hypotheses tested, and results interpreted; findings are written up in a manuscript which is submitted for publication. Although highly simplified, this vignette illustrates the integral nature of narrative, data, and code in modern scientific research.

In fact, they are one system, with critical feedbacks across temporal and spatial scalesâ (Ostrom 2007, p. 15181). SES frameworks are built around the analysis of action situations similar to those defined by Parsons (Sect. 4.3.3). They have been developed in order âto clarify the structure of an SES so we understand the niche involved and how a particular solution may help to improve outcomes or make them worse. Also, solutions may not work the same way over time. As structural variables change, participants need to have ways of learning and adapting to these changesâ (Ostrom 2007, p. 15181). Figure 4.6 summarises the influencing factors at a very high level of aggregation into an analytical framework that seeks to define common characteristics of SES and to draw on both social sciences as well as natural sciences. Similar to the farming systems research framework, the generic SES framework (1) relies on systems thinking appropriate to address complex governance problems and (2) makes use of a range of disciplinary expertise that is interdisciplinary combined.

378,132,0.372,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"None of this can be captured by exchange value or market prices. The governance of nature requires multidimensional evidence instead of the typical monetized costâbeneï¬t analyses that are popular in policymaking. In those natural protection measures, investment in education, extent of social welfare, etc., are judged by quantifying their value in monetary terms. Equipped with those numbers one can calculate when it is âeconomicâ to implement them. There are no general standards as to how this conversion should be done, so it is down to the ethical judgments and mind-set of theâoften economics-trainedâpolicy advisor: what is the monetary value of a human life? How much should saving thousands of lives a year through tougher pollution standards therefore be allowed to cost? When is it too expensive? Whose competitiveness might be impacted by the higher costs of production? When it comes to presenting the âevidence,â numerical equations radiate the aura of objectivity. But digging into what twenty-ï¬rst century science tells us about nature renders equations unsuitable for sound economic governance. Ecological economists like Daly therefore demand a precautionary approach that starts from the premise that certain functions of natureâsome of its lawsâcannot be duplicated by humans but are essential to the continuation of human prosperity on this planet, at least for the foreseeable future. They determine the quantity of and rate at which nature develops the low entropy resources that humans use. For example, the humus in fertile soil that takes up to 2000 years to form, and the fossil fuels that started forming 300 to 400 million year ago. Likewise the way that high entropy waste in the form of emissions, chemicals and heat can be absorbed by plants, soil, water, and so on. Sustainability economics will need to embed the exchange value loop model in the real world, argues Daly. During his time from 1988 to 1994 as a senior"
378,62,0.372,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"â¢ Evolutionists foresee conventional worlds because they are convinced that the dominant patterns of the modern era can be adjusted to deliver prosperity, stability and ecological health. â¢ Catastrophists foresee a future of barbarization because they predict that environmental, social and economic crises will lead to a perfect storm. â¢ Transformationists share these concerns but still believe that a Great Transition toward sustainable solutions is possible. The authors describe two development scenarios for each of the three worldviews in the event that each type of thinkingâevolutionist, catastrophist, transformationistâguides peopleâs actions and decisions in consumption, production and policymaking. Examples include whether or not societies will elaborate policies aiming to decouple resource use from economic growth or if they might, at the same time, aim to reduce overall resource use. Other paradigmatic crossroads look at what might happen if we continue to pursue more GDP per capita as a means for better living or, by contrast, if the consumption-based welfare idea is challenged. Still others examine whether the ï¬nancial markets are perceived as efï¬cient drivers of economic development or not, and so on. In a massive modeling endeavor, the study substantiates the narratives with quantiï¬ed estimates on resource use and availability, economic output numbers and some social criteria in each scenario. This is done by estimating how selected indicator developmentsâe.g., emission or resource extraction patternsâwould be impacted by the combined consumption, production and policy choices described as likely for each of the different worldviews.

Every discourse or effort to reinvent journalism regarding media economics (e.g. crowdfunding), investigation methods (e.g. data-driven journalism in the deep web), formats (e.g. slide casts), and distribution (e.g. content curation) almost inevitably seems to circle around interactive online media. Obviously the web is not only seen as the main cause of the crisis, but also as the main opportunity for innovations to solve it. On the other hand, one could also argue that due to an increasing number of popular science formats on television, science journalism now reaches a much wider audience as compared to print publications which have always merely"

We can, but it will take discipline. As modelers or researchers, we must discipline ourselves to work more closely with our clientsâ the planners, managers, and other specialists who are responsible for the development and operation of our water resource systems. We must study their systems and their problems, and we must identify their information needs. We must develop better tools that they themselves can use to model their water resource systems and obtain an improved understandingâa shared visionâof how their system functions and of their available management options and associated impacts or consequences. We must be willing to be multidisciplinary and capable of including all relevant data in our analyses. We must appreciate and see the perspectives of the agronomists, ecologists, economists, engineers, hydrologists, lawyers, or political and regional scientistsâyou name itâas appropriate. Viewing a water resource system from a single-discipline perspective is rarely sufï¬cient to meet todayâs water resource systems planning challenges. Even if we have successfully incorporated all relevant disciplines and data in our analyses, we should have a healthy skepticism about our resulting information. We must admit that this information, especially concerning what might happen in the future, is uncertain. If we are looking into the future (whether using crystal balls or mathematical models), we must admit that many of our assumptions, e.g., parameter values, cannot even be calibrated let alone veriï¬ed. Our conclusions or estimates can be very sensitive to our assumptions. One of our major challenges is to communicate this uncertainty in understandable ways to those who ask for our predictions."

Like VPH, PD took human health to be a goal of primary importance. However, Schwabeâs persistently broad interest in the lives of parasites in general, and the fact that E. granulosus infection in animals did not immediately threaten human health, made PD a better fit for his work. It offered him the opportunity to keep the parasite at the very centre of enquiry. He helped to track infection rates and run prevention programmes for a number of parasites, from soil-transmitted helminths such as hookworm to fungi that caused animal disease. He combined this pursuit of human health with investigations into a variety of aspects of parasitology, such as taxonomy and evolutionary history, which some medical researchers might have regarded as somewhat esoteric and ancillary to medical concerns. for Schwabe, then, working for PD enabled him, in large part, to follow parasites where they led him.51 This was true also in a geographical sense. In 1965 alone, Schwabe visited eight countries during the months of July and August.52 And while his time at the WHO was a whirlwind of consulting on a range of parasitic infections, coordinating international meetings, and producing technical reports and bulletins, he also continued to focus on E. granulosus in these travels and draw conclusions about the array of human social and cultural niches into which the parasite could insert itself. Through Schwabeâs efforts to correlate findings in a vast array of different environments and human cultural contexts, E. granulosus built increasingly elaborate and transnational connectionsâfor example, bringing Nelson in Kenya into collaboration with a prominent American E. granulosus researcher, Robert Rausch, to compare the parasite in the wild hyenas of Kenya with the sylvatic transmission cycles of wolves and moose in Alaska. Enabling such connections inspired Schwabe, and he later recalled that this was âwhat I first visualized trying to do for WHOâ.53 Nevertheless, despite his enthusiasm for some aspects of the job, Schwabe was not long for the WHO, and in his memoir he suggests that"
320,485,0.37,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Since 2007, it has been widely accepted that the global climate is warming and that human-induced increases in greenhouse gas emissions are mostly the cause (Kerr 2007). Global warming has been recognised to have profound impact on physical and biological systems. Of particular concern is the effect of global warming on biological diversity. Predictions of extinction have estimated that 20â30 % of species might face increasingly high risk of extinction. However, mechanisms of species persistence could lower the estimated extinction rate, while taking into consideration other human impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, landscape fragmentation or alien species introduction) could account for additional biodiversity loss (Botkin et al. 2007). Invasive species have been recognised as one of the most salient threats to biodiversity. Non-native species occurring in habitats where they were not present before the introduction are termed invaders or alien species. Rapidly increasing problems caused by invasive alien species worldwide demand the effective implementation of various policies aimed at reducing the impact of potentially or currently problematic non-native species (Richardson and PysÌek 2004). To understand changes in biodiversity, we must take into consideration at least the effects of global warming and the possibility that alien species might benefit from them. The future impact of global climate warming will vary from region to region. The most striking variation will involve changes in precipitation, and drought is expected in some areas like the Mediterranean (Kerr 2007). To these changes local species might respond with forced migrations. On the other hand, the alien invasive species already found in the Mediterranean might respond"

Starting in the 1960s and during the following decades, conservation-focussed Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) also became involved in monitoring schemes, such as the Common Bird Census of the British Trust for Ornithology. Since the 1990s, the Habitats and Birds directives further stimulated species monitoring in European countries, although even today major gaps remain (Schmeller 2008; Henle et al. 2013). The global change discourse has increased the demand for biological monitoring. The Aichi Targets for 2020 by Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity afï¬rm an international desire to curb the rate of biodiversity loss (Leadley et al. 2014) and their assessment requires an expansion of current species monitoring efforts (Pereira et al. 2012; Tittensor et al. 2014). Ecological monitoring in the early 20th century was largely organised around estimating population sizes of speciï¬c species. Capture-recapture methods were developed for ï¬sh by the Danish biologist Carl Petersen in the 1890s. In the mid-20th century, technologies developed in the world wars, including radioisotopes and radio-tracking collars, revolutionised ecological monitoring, and broadened the scope of monitoring from individual populations to ecosystem level processes. Part of this trend was reflected in the development of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network (Aronova et al. 2010). In the last few decades, the development of extensive monitoring schemes based on trained volunteers or citizen scientists has allowed for the tracking of entire taxonomic groups over national and continental scales, for example, the Breeding Bird Survey in the USA or the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (Pereira and Cooper 2006). At the same time, remote sensing technology has started to make incursions into species level monitoring (see Chap. 8), including population counts of birds and mammals or the detection of invasive species (Pettorelli et al. 2014). In the last decade, the development of websites, such as ebird.org, ispot.org, inaturalist.org and observado.org, which allow for the global recording and sharing of species observations, has led to a new wave of citizen science engagement (see Chap. 9). Studies of biodiversity remain unevenly distributed across the globe. One review of papers published in ten leading journals from 2004 to 2009 found that approximately 75 % of studies are conducted in protected areas (Martin et al. 2012). Studies were also disproportionately conducted in temperate, wealthy countries. Similarly, Amano and Sutherland (2013) found that a countryâs wealth, language, geographical location, and security explain variation in data availability in four different types of biodiversity databases. At a global scale, biodiversity monitoring is also biased towards consideration of certain taxa. For example, systematic IUCN Red List assessments have been carried out for only a few taxonomic groups, and the proportion of species assessed in each group is unrelated to its representation in global diversity (Pereira et al. 2012). Such geographical biases and historical contingencies have led to mismatches between prioritisation and protection (Jenkins et al. 2013). In the past, gathering data for biodiversity management involved querying colleagues and conducting extensive literature reviews. But in the past two decades,"

In approaching risk communication and learning, we test different ways and methods from 2004 to nowadays. Here we describe two cases study we develop in the last four years in which students and experts have collaborated in preparing (1) a participated exhibition on the 2011 flood that severely hit the land of La Spezia and surrounding, and (2) a flipped-up learning tool. The participated exhibition is Piovono Idee! (Cloudy with a Chance of ideas!) and it is the result of expertsâ interaction directly in school, focus groups and hands on activities. Students involved had experience the disaster and could put their emotion into their products. Exhibits of the interactive path tell us their own history. Primary and secondary schools in areas strongly affected by the flood of the 25th October 2011âBorghetto Vara, Brugnato, Monterosso, Vernazza, Riomaggiore, Pignone, RiccÃ² del Golfo, Aulla and Ragnaia (Aulla)âand secondary schools from the city of La Spezia were directly involved in the participatory action. Planning, creation and exhibition were the three main phases of the action to improve their speciï¬c scientiï¬c knowledge with hands-on activities, while exploring feelings and emotions triggered by the experience of a flood. The learn-by playing approach is also used to instil appropriate behaviours and the awareness that every actions we take derives from a choice: we can chose whether or not be respectful towards nature. Even little actions can turn into negative or positive consequences as it is sudden evident in Piovono idee!. Indeed the learning path starts with the question: âIs nature scary?â shows a colored and smiling Nature full of gifts, which can became angry simply poking on it. The discovery of hydrogeological risk continues focusing on the importance to respect territory and on the correct land use with different totems, exhibits, experiments, scientiï¬c games. It emotionally involves the participants to favor reflective learning (Piangiamore et al. 2014, 2015). The latest activities are two role games to enforce eco-friendly behaviors for hydrological risk mitigation. A few years later, Piovono idee! was updated and the exhibition got fully portable since 2015 and ready to travel the schools of the country to involve as many citizens as possible. The second edition of Piovono idee! (Fig. 4) is also an example of peer-education activity as students of the High School of La Spezia and of the Secondary school of Lerici, that were not directly and emotionally involved in the disaster, have played the role of the guides for general public (BernhardsdÃ³ttir et al. 2012; Piangiamore et al. 2016). The flipped-up learning tool is the EAS Floods: what to do?, an application of the Episodes of Situated Learning (EAS) method to natural hazard education (Rivoltella 2014; Piangiamore et al. 2015). The EAS method acts on problem solving abilities that the classroom shared among peer and"

Responding participants conï¬rmed that they could address social innovation through their daily decision-making processes. Lifestyle is largely seen as the responsibility of the individual him or herself, often greatly influenced by the surrounding culture. A lot of exposure to pollution is caused by the socio-economic structure of society, in which one needs to participate to sustain an income. Many executive decisions are still made within this old socio-economic context, contributing to and even rewarding polluting and illness-producing behavior. Lifestyle is largely personal, but the socio-economic context is a regional leadership issue. Health hence needs to be a common innovative commitment between leadership and society."
118,343,0.37,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"geographically global (a malicious human act), imperceptible in time either manifesting very quickly (on the Internet) or very slowly (high level radioactive waste disposal), or irreversible (release of radioactivity due to a core-melt accident). We are like the driver of a modern automobile, cruising along on the Interstate (in a linear world), and now suddenly, we are faced with âblack iceâ! The impacts we have described above lead to unprecedented ethical issues as reflected in the three questions above. Moreover, questions such as: âWhat constitutes an acceptable risk and why?â take on new meaning in the face of challenges to the ecology of life. There is a growing belief, as noted by Donald Rumsfeldâs quote above, that not only is the future unknown, it is unknowable. Moreover, because these complex ethical issues are arising so much faster than ever before, and because there has been little time to develop normative processes for decisionmaking, there is even greater ambiguity. The unknown-unknown looms large in the domain of Risk as feelings. What we are pointing to, for lack of a better description, is a Cultural Risk Analysis. This would entail making explicit the implicit cultural conditioning of individuals, and organizations/institutions, and their relationship to the society in which they abide. Such a Cultural Risk Analysis would illuminate cases where the underlying societal culture runs counter to the demands of safety culture, such as for nuclear power. If aspects of the societal culture are left implicit, they just donât underlie the safety culture, they will undermine it. If made explicit, it becomes possible for the safety culture to be designed and constructed in a way that accounts for, accommodates or even overcomes the conflicts between the two cultures. Such a Cultural Risk Analysis would then require an analysis of cultural conditioning, much the same way we analyze the machine. This would mean understanding how underlying assumptions, values, and beliefs come from culturally defined sources and not âobjective factsâ.20 However, there is one major difference; people are âcomplexâ emotional, mental, physical and spiritual human beings. Humans are not âcomplicatedâ machines and so are not amenable to a linear reductionist approach. Human beings have emergent properties, namely feelings and thoughts that do not reside in any one part of the body. Humans may respond differently to the same stimulus on any given day. And there are no âclosed formâ analytical solutions to describe human behavior; it is, for the most part subjective. Coincidentally with the development of these new complex technologies, there has been growing empirical evidence that in the realm of human decision-making, the emotional precedes the cognitive [29], and that motivation and intention derive from the unconsciousâ emotive and subconscious-mental [30]. These findings have found their way into such fields as Behavioral Economics [31] and Risk Perception [32], among others (An extensive literature review can be found in [33]). And a number of consulting companies have developed analytical methods in an attempt to quantify the âRisk Cultureâ of Business Organizations. In this case, the focus is on comparing the âselfinterestâ of the individual employees versus the corporate interest. 20 By âobjective factsâ, I mean empirical observation and data.

Indeed, âgood governance is crucial for researchâ¦ Absence of regulation is not beneficial for researchâ¦ Regulatory oversight adds another layer to the web of quality control in researchâ (Gottweis and Triendl 2006). In other words, in this third round of comments, the ethical infrastructure was suddenly regarded as an integral part of excellence in science: âHave your ethics in place!â In dialectical terms: on a more advanced level of comprehension, science and ethics became reconciled again. Both were acknowledged as complementary dimensions of good scientific practice (academic Sittlichkeit). Hwang still functioned as a foil, but now for highlighting the (self-perceived) ethical robustness of Western research practices. From a macro-perspective, the Hwang case must be regarded as symptomatic for a broader, even global development. Frank Miedema (2012) professor of immunology and Dean of the Medical Faculty of Utrecht University, distinguishes three stages in the recent history of science. Science 1.0 (M1, dialectically speaking) was a type of research that was autonomous and curiosity driven. Increasingly however, a different type of research seems called for (Science 2.0: M2), producing knowledge that is relevant for societal stakeholders and entailing economic value (Miedema 2012, p. 24). This implies new (post-classical) quality criteria, but also growing tensions and contradictions between the inherent dynamics of academic work and the societal and economic expectations involved. But eventually, according to the author, a situation of co-creation is evolving (â M3), in which the questions and interests of science and society become more adequately aligned and knowledge production becomes coproduction: Science 3.0 (M3) (cf. Gibbons et al. 1994; Nowotny et al. 2001; Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 2001)."

The rapid spread and extensive mortality associated with WNS raise serious concerns about population viability for species that are being impacted by this disease. In this chapter, we review what is currently known about WNS, focusing on mechanisms of disease, disease ecology, global distribution patterns and conservation and management. We first explain why WNS belongs in a volume addressing bats in the Anthropocene.

38,564,0.37,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.2.2 France To a large extent, biodiversity monitoring in France depends on Citizen Science and thus its success depends on the efï¬cacy of project implementation at a national scale. France has many small national NGOs (e.g., French Bird Life group Ligue de Protection des Oiseaux with about 40,000 members), and these NGOs alone were not able to launch an ambitious national monitoring initiatives. Thus, success of the national effort required a larger institution that could lead and coordinate these smaller efforts. Fortunately, the French National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) was and is able to perform this role. In addition, this research institution is under Ministries who are ofï¬cially designated role to document the state of biodiversity in France. Therefore, the success of the national monitoring effort in France required both building capacity among the smaller NGOs, as well as a government institution with stable funding and staff to provide a common monitoring framework. Integrating the individual Citizen Science-driven monitoring programs started with MNHN hosting the bird ringing project, a very successful a partnership between professional researchers and volunteers. The MNHN also launched a classical Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), again using the Citizen Science provided by the smaller NGOs [together, these formed the STOC (Le Suivi Temporel des Oiseaux Communs â Vigie Nature = Temporal Survey of Common Birds) program]. Several factors facilitated the success of these schemes: (1) coupling the BBS to the already-existing ringing efforts; (2) focusing on common birds, thus avoiding an overlap with other projects concerned with all species (and thus proportionally more rare species); (3) the concomitant emergence of biodiversity indicator based monitoring schemes, based on Mean Species Abundance, (e.g., the Breeding Bird Survey), ensuring considerable political interest in these schemes, and (4) this effort coincided with citizen science becoming fashionable in France. With the success of the national bird monitoring effort, two new schemes were put in place to develop capacity for monitoring other taxa. The ï¬rst was based on the same logic as the Breeding Bird Survey: training and motivating skilled amateurs to collect data following a protocol and a sampling design for butterflies, bats plants, and dragonflies. The second program was developed to train and coordinate efforts of the general public to monitor garden butterflies and snails, bumblebees, birds, flower-dwelling insects, and wild plants in cities. All these schemes are coordinated by the same scientiï¬c team based at the MNHN, but each also relies on a speciï¬c NGO partner, which is dedicated to the success of the (speciï¬c) participant network. The NGO partner trains participants, ensures that each new scheme capitalises directly on preceding experience to maximise the chance for joint data analysis, and coordinates all efforts with MNHN. Several characteristics have made this effort an outstanding success: (1) different monitoring schemes for different species groups were integrated from the beginning, (2) the same research group was involved in citizen science schemes for both skilled amateurs and the general public, (3) strong involvement of researchers in designing citizen science projects"

IUGG and its Associations operate through more than 110 scientiï¬c divisions, commissions, committees, working groups, and services. IUGG holds general and scientiï¬c assemblies, during which policies governing the union are discussed and adopted, and research programs requiring international participation are formulated, coordinated, and planned. At the assemblies, national delegates of IUGG Member countries pass resolutions on important scientiï¬c and science policy issues, particularly related to natural hazards and reduction of risks (Ismail-Zadeh 2016). IUGG Associations work to set global standards for research, such as the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF 2014), the Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice (Bormann 2012), and the Guidelines for Professional Interaction during Volcanic Crises (IAVCEI Subcommittee for Crisis Protocols 1999). In particular, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame provides a realization (i.e., a set of coordinates of some points located on the Earthâs surface) to the International Terrestrial Reference System, a world spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth in its diurnal motion in space. World navigation systems are referenced either to a speciï¬c ITRF realization or to their own coordinate systems, which are then referenced to an ITRF realization. Precise navigation assists in monitoring natural hazards, particularly movements of landslides, lavas, lahar, and debris flows. IUGG Associations oversee eighteen geodetic and geophysical services, particularly those related to monitoring natural hazards. For example, IAG established an observing system â the Global Geodetic Observing Systemâwhich works with IAGâs international services to provide the geodetic infrastructure necessary for monitoring the Earth system including hazards and disasters and for global change research (Plag and Pearlman 2009)."

We treat it separately because of its relationship with health. Since parasites comprise about half the Earthâs biota, they form a critical component of biodiversity of the Gulf. An abundance of parasites, with an emphasis on helminths, indicates a healthy ecosystem or a healthy host species. This method provides an especially powerful marker because most helminths have three, plus or minus two hosts, in a specific cycle. Consequently, the presence of that specific helminth in a habitat indicates that all members of the cycle are or had recently been present in the habitat. Because of this cycle, the absence of helminths provides indicators of disruption. The reason for the indication is that adverse impacts on the corresponding intermediate host (or final host) for the species or the population result in fewer species or smaller parasite populations. Fewer parasite species or parasite populations show there was a disruption, even if it was not otherwise apparent."
10,331,0.369,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Following Contextual Interaction Theory such a generally supportive governance context is expected to have positive consequences for the motivation, cognitions and resources of the actors involved in the process of implementing drought resilience measures. What we did observe is a varying and on average moderate, but also growing degree of draught awareness among the actors. This also positively influenced their motivation. Of course there is here a strong pre-selection effect: while all measures are taken voluntarily it is no surprise to see predominantly positive motivations. On the other hand: also with previously sceptic actors like the agricultural organization positive developments are observable. The resources of the actors made available for drought resilience measures and to push and pull to get them accepted are generally sufï¬cient, with the exception of the withdrawal of the national government from the support for nature development and the national landscape park that has made things more difï¬cult. On the positive side, the provincial government has compensated this loss to a large degree, indicating its preparedness to contribute. All in all this has led to an implementation process with a remarkable degree of collaboration. When we look more speciï¬cally into the three actor characteristics of Contextual Interaction Theory we see the following. The motivation of the stakeholders working to act on drought is triggered to large extent by their own goals and values. In a dense country such as the Netherlands, the last remnants of nature are seen as especially precious. In addition, desiccation is considered one of the major environmental policy themes in the Dutch government for several decades now. The local water authority views cultivating drought resilience for the area as its own responsibility. Also nature organizations and more and more farmers are aware of the implications of drought and water scarcity, including loss of flora and fauna in creeks and crop losses. For the province also the external pressure of European policies is very relevant. Low self-effectiveness assessment on top-down regulation of preparatory measures limits the scope of instruments to voluntary ones. The cognitions of actors are mainly driven by observations on the changes of the regional water balance. The visibility of drought issues has increased in the region, with creeks running dry as well as dry vegetation. Damages from droughts are affecting agricultural yields in rural areas. Cities and their urban infrastructure are also affected by drought, which in leads to a change in awareness and perception. In contrast to the strong legal requirements behind nature conservation in the Netherlands there are limited resources for the nature organizations to combat drought issues themselves. Their key competencies are rather limited. Other actors,"

275,612,0.369,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"The importance of the distinction has not been lost in analyses of recent behaviour of finance firms, which, in the years leading to the global financial meltdown of 2008, operated with highly regarded, highly precise risk assessments that were all based on the basic premise that the relevant conditions and outcomes are all measurable [3, 13, 26, 32, 40, 41]. When, in a mass financial panic, institutional investors suddenly realised that the assumptions about their risks being measurable were deeply flawed, financial markets collapsed in the kind of event that has been described as a âdestructive flight to qualityâ. Investors clambered over the top of each other to dump everything but the safest and hence least profitable assets, in a sudden cascading systemic failure having global ramifications that continue to reverberate nearly a decade later. The distinction between risk and uncertainty in economics is not an esoteric matter, but a very practical pervasive kind of problem with potentially huge ramifications. Indeed, the aftermath of the economic crisis has seen a considerable resurgence of interest among economists in fundamental uncertainty, after a long period where the primary interest was in formalising economics - and particularly finance - using precision stochastic risk models (see for instance [26]). In contrast to Knight, Keynes [25] argued for a deeper ontological notion of fundamental uncertainty: we do not even know what we do not know. In this view, the future is fundamentally uncertain because it is simply not possible even in principle to conceive of all relevant possible future outcomes in advance.4 Investment, Keynes maintained, is then the allocation of resources on the basis of expectations formed under conditions of this kind of uncertainty. Keynes formulated a set of conventions to describe how agents try to cope under such uncertainty, by resorting to what amount to superstitious rituals from the point of view of utility-maximising economic rationality. They tend to presume that their existing opinions are a valid guide. They tend to conform to majority views. They just ignore what is unknown: widespread reliance on risk models under the assumption that all the uncertainty is measurable as briefly described above is a prevalent contemporary example.5 They presume that present circumstances will be stable. They rely on the opinion of experts who concoct grand predictions from the economic tea leaves. Perhaps most importantly, in a mammoth and sometimes even wilful act of self-deception, they assume far greater veracity for these measures than what any frank examination of the past would ever support. In short, agents invest on the basis of strongly predictive models, and the consequences are far-reaching. It means that markets cannot be in stable efficiency equilibria, that investment is highly volatile, and that expectations are extremely fragile. It also means that complex behaviour such as economic bubbles and bursts and overall unpredictability of economic systems can be wholly generated endogenously [1, 11, 21, 26, 29, 31, 32, 41, 46, 52]. This turbulent picture stands in contrast to the text4 I will come back to the reason for this in detail in a subsequent section. Briefly: the questions"
253,1148,0.369,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","30.4.2 Conclusions for Autonomous Driving Autonomous driving will be an everyday technology that is as closely connected to peopleâs lives as driving is today. That distinguishes it greatly from nuclear energy, while it shares this everyday-life quality with green biotechnology (through its use in food production) and mobile communication technology. From both risk debates we may extract the insight of how central the dimension of individual beneï¬t is. While any such beneï¬t from eating genetically modiï¬ed food has scarcely even been advanced by its proponents, the individual beneï¬ts of mobile telephones and mobile internet access are readily evident. And as soon as this beneï¬t is demonstrably large, people are prepared to assume possible risks. And this is absolutely rational from an action theory standpoint. What is irrational is to assume risks when the beneï¬ts are not evident or would only accrue to other actors (e.g. Monsanto in the green biotechnology debate). In such cases a risk debate can have dramatic consequences and obliterate any chance of acceptance. Another such knock-out scenario is the possibility of a massive catastrophe such as the âresidual riskâ of the meltdown of a nuclear power facility. This was decided on the political level, albeit with little chance of external influence. The situation was thus widely regarded as a passive risk situation in which people were exposed to potential harm by the decisions of others. Nothing can be gleaned directly from this scenario for autonomous driving as it would presumably be introduced in the familiar market context of conventional transportation and thus de facto depend on the acceptance of users from the outset. While it is possible to imagine other introduction scenarios (Chap. 10), state-mandated use of autonomous driving is all but unthinkable. The only indirect lesson from the history of nuclear energy is that expertocratic arrogance generates mistrust. An open discussion âbetween equalsââa lesson from the nanotechnology debate as wellâis a key precondition for a constructive debate on technology in an open society. These examples also show that talk of a German aversion to technology is a myth born of the experiences with nuclear energy and genetic engineering. All empirical studies"
232,447,0.369,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"that are signiï¬cantly impeded due to a lack of resources in the face of a societal emergencyâ, this new concept of nuclear safety insist on the link between engineering processes and social contingencies. In this paper we therefore try to shade a light on collaborative process where social scientist and engineers come to work together (more than side to side) in order to seek determinants of successful collaborations. The paper focuses on an historical case: the (so called) Swiss Cheese Model of accidents. Since the early 1990, the Swiss Cheese Model (SCM) of the psychologist James Reason has established itself as a reference model in the etiology, investigation or prevention of industrial accidents. Its success in many ï¬elds (transport, energy, medical) has made it the vector of a new paradigm of Safety Science: the organizational accident. A comprehensive literature review of Reasonâs work leads us to consider the SCM as the result of a complex (and poorly documented) collaboration process between the ï¬elds of research and industry; human sciences and engineering sciences. In a dualistic premise where research and industry would be two entities interacting but still separable, this collaboration would be understood as the appropriation of research work by the industrial world. However, the complexity of the genesis of the SCM forces an overcoming of this dualism to bring out a process of âco-productionâ of knowledge. As part of this research, the two main âfathersâ of the SCM: James Reason (psychologist and theorist of human error) and John Wreathall (nuclear engineer) where interviewed by the author. These meetings shed a new light on a proliï¬c era for the Safety Sciences ï¬eld. We therefore hope to keep from a retrospective bias that tends to smooth and simplify facts. This chapter deals with the induced effects of the collaboration between a psychologist and an engineer in terms of models production. In the ï¬rst section, we briefly present the two âfathersâ of the SCM and the social and historical context in which their collaboration took place. In the second section, we focus on the effects of this collaboration over their intellectual and scientiï¬c productions. Note that prior knowledge of the SCM, its theoretical foundations and its main uses is requested (see, for example LarouzÃ©e et al. [2])."
347,305,0.368,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The short- and long-term ecosystem effects of oil discharges depend on a variety of factors including the season and weather, type and quantity of oil spilled, habitat, type of shoreline as well as the tidal energy and type of waves in the area of the spill (e.g. Rousi and KankaanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2012). Consequently, there is a substantial degree of scientific uncertainty linked to the assessment of ecosystem risks of oil discharges. However, this type of scientific uncertainty on ecosystem impacts is not of substantial importance for assessment-management interactions in this case (Hassler et al. 2010). That oil discharges are dangerous for the marine environment and should be avoided as much as possible within reasonable economic limits is not contested.7 The main issues of assessment-management interactions relating to oil spills rather concern (1) what the actual probabilities and prevalence of oil discharges are (i.e. mainly monitoring and surveillance activities) and (2) how the probability, extent and prevalence of oil spills can be reduced through improved technological safety, reductions in human errors and improved management measures to reduce intentional oil discharges. Consequently, compared with risks such as chemical pollution, the risks of oil discharge and uncertainty-related challenges concerning them are not as severe in the context of the Baltic Sea, barring a few exceptions. First, there is still a lack of aerial and satellite data of intentional oil discharges for monitoring and surveillance purposes in spite of a well-developed system for monitoring of larger vessels through the HELCOM AIS system (Hassler et al. 2010). This uncertainty linked to surveillance and monitoring impedes a comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of oil discharges (especially intentional discharges), as well as complicates attempts to enforce and monitor the efficiency of management strategies (such as the above-mentioned HELCOM no-special-fee system) (Hassler et al. 2010; Hassler 2011). Second, regarding safety improvements, there is scientific uncertainty linked to issues concerning the feasibility and cost-efficiency of various technical solutions. It can also be argued that the PSSA (particularly sensitive sea area) classification of the Baltic Sea by the IMO shows that there is an agreement (and substantial scientific knowledge) that the Baltic Sea is particularly sensitive to, e.g., oil discharges."

The Italian early warning system was put in place with the intent of following a speciï¬c approach, also conï¬rmed by the Sendai Framework, that has shifted its focus towards Disaster Risk Management (DRM) as opposed to Disaster Management. The aim of the paper is to stress the challenge and the relevance of the approach to reducing landslide risk, which requires the involvement of many actors, including scientists and decision makers, as well as international, national, local, governmental, and non-governmental institutions, to ï¬nd, develop and share new and best practices in the technical-scientiï¬c and regulation ï¬elds in order to make the necessary tools and instruments available to carry out the challenging tasks deï¬ned in the Sendai Framework toward real Disaster Risk Reduction.

364,246,0.368,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"The incidence of food insecurity can be viewed as the ultimate effect of several inter-related biophysical and socio-economic factors that comprise the main hazards and risks. Environmental degradation, for example, may be caused by a combination of manâs interaction with physical resources and naturally occurring hazards. It is evident in all the sites that the declining land resource base is adversely affecting farm and fishery householdsâ incomes and livelihoods, resulting in the threat of food insufficiency for the poorest. Across sites, households perceive that continued occurrence of climatic and other natural events in the years to come will have a major impact on their incomes, family health, food security, and the circumstances of the community as a whole. With these issues in mind, the following technical and policy concerns should be taken into consideration to develop a research agenda that would facilitate the creation of a plan for managing watersheds and implementing related strategies. 1. Developing an integrated approach to watershed management that covers both land and water resources entails convening the major stakeholders to: (1) develop and agree on a common vision, goals, and objectives for managing the watershed and lake resources (e.g., improved water quality for a given period of time); (2) identify issues and problems that may hinder the fulfilment of the vision, goals, and objectives; and (3) prioritize and develop an agreed action plan for dealing with the identified problems and/or constraints. 2. In trying to address issues relating to soil and land degradation, it is important to determine whether the causes are anthropogenic or geogenic, since the potential solutions would be different. For example, many problems related to soil and land degradation can be traced to watershed management practices that are dictated by stakeholdersâ socio-economic circumstances. Of research interest, therefore, are studies on the appropriateness of different technologies given different physical and biological conditions of the soil. Technologies that address different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions among farmers might include re-vegetation, erosion control measures, water conservation, agroforestry systems, organic farming, and use of organic pesticides. 3. When developing plans for the watershed areas, addressing poverty and providing the means to make a living at the household level should be a major consideration, given our understanding of the relationships between land and water resources"

The concepts of Science 2.0 and Open Science will be introduced. As such we provide a short introduction to the history of science and knowledge dissemination. We explain the origins of our scientific culture which evolved around publication methods. Interdependencies of current concepts will be elucidated and it will be stated that the transition towards Open Science is a complex cultural change. Reasons as to why the change is slow are discussed and the main obstacles are identified. Next, we explain the recent changes in scientific workflows and how these cause changes in the system as a whole. Furthermore, we provide an overview on the entire book and explain what can be found in each chapter. Nicole Forsterâs goal as a researcher is to enhance cancer treatment. That is why she and her colleagues in the laboratory of Leif W. Ellisen at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, Massachusetts, study tumors on individual levels and search for cancer causes. In March 2012 Forster was trying to isolate ribonucleic acid (RNA)âthe genetic blueprint for proteins within the cellâwithin mouse cells. To prepare the cells for her experiment she mixed them with a special gel that provided them with all the nutrients to grow and proliferate, even outside the body, for a short period of time. Yet in the following step, she had to get rid of the gel to get to the information she needed: the RNA. And therein lay S.

222,218,0.368,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Bangladesh ranks fifth in the WorldRiskIndex for disaster risk related to natural disasters in 2016 (Comes et al. 2016). Around 26 per cent of the population are affected by cyclones, while 70 per cent live in flood-prone regions (Cash et al. 2013). The coastal delta is particularly vulnerable to cyclones and tidal surges owing to its low elevation (Chap. 8). Other hazards that the coastal area is exposed to include coastal and river erosion and water logging from polders. Since the 1950s changes in extreme weather events have been observed (IPCC 2014). In Bangladesh weather and extreme weather were found to be associated with mortality (Lindeboom et al. 2012). In Abhoynagar, a rural coastal sub-district of Bangladesh, it was found that heavy rainfall was associated with mortality (Lindeboom et al. 2012). Extreme precipitation events and higher temperatures are likely to cause widespread food-borne and water-borne disease outbreaks including cholera and other diarrheal diseases. Cholera (Vibrio cholerae) outbreaks have been shown to be linked to rising sea surface temperatures which trigger the release of cholera into the environment. Cholera risk may be exacerbated by coastal and estuarine water warming or by local flooding (RodÃ³ et al. 2002; Lipp et al. 2002). Thus it was found that cholera risk in Bangladesh increases with the increase in sea surface temperature (Shahid 2009). Increased precipitation in the country has been also linked to increased non-cholera diarrhoea (Hashizume et al. 2007). Bangladesh is highly prone to flooding because of its location at the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) rivers and because of the hydro-meteorological and topographical characteristics of the GBM delta (Mirza 2002). On average, annual floods inundate around 20 per cent of the country and can reach up to 70 per cent during an extreme flood event (Mirza 2002). As a result about two-thirds of the tube-wells and all toilets have become unusable in Bangladesh (Annya et al. 2010). During floods water supply and sanitation condition becomes severely disrupted and allows the spread of various water-borne diseases. Low-lying coastal regions across the world are prone to salt water intrusion due to sea-level rise (Chap. 17 and 18). In Bangladesh, the south-west coast is subject to additional drivers of salinity ingress such as"
178,260,0.368,Ethics Dumping : Case Studies From North-South Research Collaborations,"Area of Risk of Exploitation An investigator breached the Declaration of Helsinki and other global ethical guidelines by ignoring an ethical review oversight process that was fully functional in Liberia. The investigator was provided with information about the countryâs ethical review process at meetings of the Ebola Response Incident Management System, but chose to deploy the research team into targeted communities without ethical approval, collecting data through focus group discussions, key informant interviews and in-depth interviews. The data were analysed and submitted for presentation and/or publication at national and international meetings. The entire data collection process, involving sensitive topics centred on Ebola-affected communities, was highly distressing. The consent process was conducted at the discretion of the researcher and the study team (Pollock, 2012). Providing so-called consent processes to participants in the frenzy of an epidemic can lead to misconceptions on their part. Risk mitigation measures were not fully assessed because guidance from an ethical institution was not explored or sought prior to the conduct of the study. The fundamental pillar of respect for persons was also ignored. This should be the principle upon which each research participant makes an informed choice about whether or not to participate in the research, and thus accepts the potential risks and burdens of participation (Jasanoff, 1993). Thorough explanation to participants about the availability of the research ethics review board to address concerns regarding their rights or wellbeing, and providing contact information, are critical elements of the consent process. Whether consent is sought verbally or in writing, reference must be made to an ethics review board that reviewed and approved the research study. Ignoring one of the major pillars of ethical research â namely, ethics review â opens up a range of risks for exploitation (Martinson et al., 2005)."
198,4,0.367,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Climate change is among the most difficult challenges facing the world. Its global nature, intergenerational impact, and the massive risks and uncertainty associated with it combine to create an unparalleled need for global collective action. It is also significant in that addressing it will go a very long way toward addressing other environmental problems â air pollution, water risks, soil degradation, and the loss of forests, natural habitats, and biodiversity. At the same time, the world continues to grapple with eradicating poverty and inequalities and spurring economic growth. Going full circle, it is primarily the poor who suffer from climate change and environmental degradation. Monitoring and evaluating the efforts to address these concerns are particularly important. The stakes are high, and we have an incredibly short window to do things right. And in a time when public financing is decreasing and investment decisions are made without considering overall global environmental and development costs, evaluation is essential for us to understand how we can best make use of these limited resources. Evaluators are in a position to present evidence about how we can make a difference in promoting development that is both environmentally sound and equitable. Using relatively small resources, what can be done to help decision-makers achieve the revolution needed to address our challenges? Those who have the privilege to manage precious resources have an obligation to help decision-makers get to the right place. Using evidence, evaluators can speak truth to power. It is not only about how money is being used and whether it has a decent return. It is about measuring the results of our action, knowing why and how things are working, or not working. It is about learning. The book Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development is a collaborative venture. The chapters provide an interdisciplinary perspective and document emerging and innovative evaluation knowledge and practice of climate change and its links to sustainable development. Such knowledge based on solid"

92,165,0.367,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"PINGH serves as a system which facilitates the fostering of ideas and advocates for activities related to global health. The success of the network clearly rests in the hands of all participants as well as the leadership. It is clear from the chapters that each project had a clear focus and goal that contributed to the success and helped to reveal potential areas of growth for PINGH members. As an organization designed to support multiple partners, it is clear that the structure encourages bilateral and multilateral programming to bring about informative and transformative changes to students, professionals, and most importantly to the global health community (see Fig. 8.1). When examining the overarching structure and role of PINGH, it is an organization that can fill multiple gaps in the academia and the global health network. By providing educators, students, and the community with a framework, PINGH places value on the role of global health. A structure that supports ideas fosters collaboration and stimulates new avenues for existing, and emerging scholars situates the complexity of global health and the importance of cooperation and connectedness in addressing some of lifeâs most challenging health issues. In light of this, what follow are a series of recommendations to continue to strengthen the existing partnerships of PINGH and develop more sustainable long term collaboration: â For data collection and collaborative efforts with multiple partners, a multipronged strategy should be pursued in which large-scale surveys could be conducted by several institutions, providing greater opportunities for students, agencies, and the community at large. The greatest promise lies in research that has a longitudinal structure and includes avenues for exploring resources ranging from regional data to national data that are amenable to community-level analyses. â Due to the importance of enhancing studentsâ learning and advancement, greater avenues should be created to include students in the inclusion of projects to enhance both technical and leadership skills. Based on the projects that included students, there should be greater structures put in place to support their academic and research development further supporting them with experiences that have value beyond the classroom. â The PINGH network should establish a technical team that assists the leadership team in further highlighting the global health research efforts.

In summary, there are clear differences in how uncertainty and disagreements are dealt with (precautionary or not) in the environmental and the market spheres of chemicals policy, respectively. Science-policy interfaces are hence still far from mature and well coordinated and the deep uncertainty in this governance domain is not addressed rationally. In addition, there are no (standing) forums where stakeholders regularly can meet and discuss these issues and how best to handle disagreements."

30,23,0.367,Determinants of Financial Development,"There is less work directly addressing the potential correlation between geography and financial development in comparison to that for policy and institutions. However, much research attention has been paid to the importance of geography for general economic development, emphasizing three aspects in particular. The first group is concerned with the correlation between latitude and economic development. Countries closer to the equator typically have a more tropical climate. On the one hand, research by Kamarck (1976), Diamond (1997), Gallup et al. (1999) and Sachs (2003a, 2003b) suggests that tropical location may lead directly to poor crop yields and production due to adverse ecological conditions such as fragile tropical soils, unstable water supply and prevalence of crop pests. On the other hand, tropical location can be characterized as an inhospitable disease environment, which is believed to be a primary cause for âextractiveâ institutions (Acemoglu et al., 2001). A second strand of research relates to countries being landlocked, distant from large markets or having only limited access to coasts and rivers navigable to the ocean (Sachs and Warner, 1995a, 1995b, 1997; Easterly and Levine, 2003; Malik and Temple, 2009). As natural barriers to external trade and knowledge dissemination, geographic isolation and remoteness to some extent determine the scale and structure of external trade in which countries engage. The potential to enter a large economic market and exploit economies of scale may be limited by particular geographic circumstances. The ability to develop a competitive manufacturing sector may be constrained when some intermediate inputs for the production of manufactured goods need to be imported from distant markets. As the main feature of external trade for these countries, the limited range of primary commodities exported determines the vulnerability of these countries to external shocks. The last strand of research focuses on the link between resource endowment and economic development. Diamond (1997) suggests that countries with a richer endowment of grain species have more potential for high-yielding food crops and technological development. Isham et al. (2005) argue that a developing countryâs natural resource endowment affects its economic development through an unique channel in which"

Our concerns centred on the issues faced in specific projects, such as: What were the main challenges in communicating research to a policy and business audience? Did project partners interact with policymakers? If so, did these actors adopt the research findings as evidence in support of their policy formulation or revision, and how did they ascertain whether they did so or not? If they did not embrace the research findings, what was the reason? Principal investigator of the AMMA and QWeCI projects in Ghana, Sylvester K. Danuor of the physics department of KNUST, said that in order to achieve the projectâs intended impacts, research findings were disseminated mainly at conferences and workshops, and through journal articles. According to Danuor, workshops were the most effective means of reaching out to the intended beneficiaries. These included the research community, policymakers and civil society organisations. He and other interviewees were of the view that the AMMA and QWeCI projects âhad some interactionâ with policymakers who âembraced the research findingsâ (CAAST-Net Plus 2014, p. 32). However, this was yet to be reflected in official policy formulations. For instance, there were meetings with the Ghana Meteorological Agency and the District Health Directorates through the Metropolitan Health Directorate of the Ministry of Health. There was a similar positive interaction with civil society organisations with a view to encouraging them to make use of the projectâs findings in policy formulation and activities. This account of projectâpolicy interactions is typical of the responses we received. These responses reveal a high degree of uncertainty and inability to verify the claims, however plausible they appear. As already mentioned, this reflects a lack of âoutcome thinkingâ at the level of research project design and management. In short, there was a predominant focus by project managers on outputs that are easy to document and report. Where an interaction with policymakers is mentioned, the precise mechanism through which research outputs actually influence policy or practice is rarely explained in any detail. As such, efforts to engage with and influence policymakers are mostly ad hoc at best, and amount to little more than a hope or expectation that the research findings will be accessed, understood and taken up by the relevant actors in government or the private sector. In turn, the lack of clear mechanisms or theories of change undermines efforts to reflect on the project implementation process or face the hard question of what difference their efforts made. Finally, there"

While much of the film focuses on victims, survivors and scientistsâ efforts to understand, trace the source of and treat the outbreak, the end of the film provides a critical ârevealâ. A series of brief shots shows the destruction of rainforest, disrupted bats taking refuge in a pig house, a pig sold at a wet market being prepared in a restaurant, an Asian chef with unwashed hands, and an American businesswoman, who then becomes ill, taking the viewer back to the start of the story. This narrative brings together many of the themes found across OH advocacy images. Indeed, Professor Ian Lipkin of Columbia University (an expert in emerging infectious diseases and OH ally) was a key scientific adviser for the film.98 Taken together, what can these images tell us about the sorts of animal bodies and disease that have shaped OH, and which are, in turn, shaped by it? Generic animals, humans and plants play a central roleâwith outlined images of human figures, common animals such as cows, hand-foot-paw prints, and leaves often appearing in OH logos. Reinforcing the verbal messages of OH advocates, they convey an idea of OH as a generic, universal approach that addresses all types of health problem arising at the intersections of humans, animals and environmentâeven though, as shown above, the work performed by researchers adopts a more selective approach to those problems. Once we move beyond the generic animal, more differences begin to open up between their portrayal in OH images, advocacy arguments and OH research. for example, while cows feature in a small number of OH research papers which are largely devoted to bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, they are extremely common in the visual sample. While dogs appear in both, in visual images they feature as family members and veterinary patients, notâas in scientific articlesâas carriers of rabies. Images of charismatic wildlife such as great apes and giraffes are prominent in OH advocacy but extremely rare in OH research. By contrast, animals as experimental models are rarely depicted despite their presence in the research literature. These are obvious promotional choices, making the most of publicly appealing imagery while avoiding drawing attention"

Lastly, an important expected outcome is a mechanism that is in place for sharing of good practices and expertise in relation to MHEWS across regions, countries, cities, and local communities (e.g. through lessons learnt from the use of indigenous knowledge in early warning, regional demonstration projects, etc.) and in a manner that enables countries and key stakeholders to use this information effectively. The Network will facilitate dialogue between and among stakeholders on the scientiï¬c, technological, and social issues concerning individual hazard EWS and MHEWS, and regular publications and their open access dissemination (e.g. via web portals such as PreventionWeb, media exchange, etc.) promulgating the case studies, lessons learnt and emerging issues on MHEWS, as well as related policy developments in countries, will be made available. The Network will support the conduct of regular forums, seminars and conferences to discuss current and emerging issues and to share information and knowledge, including the application of advances in science and technology to MHEWS and to provide visibility to MHEWS in established international and national discussions and platforms for As a ï¬rst major activity, encouraged by the 17th World Meteorological Congress in 2015 and as a commitment under the UN Plan of Action on DRR for Resilience, WMO and UNISDR have taken the initiative to organize an international conference on MHEWS (the earlier ones were on EWS) on 22 and 23 May 2017 in collaboration with international and national partners.

198,574,0.366,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract Brazil has historically coped with drought, a phenomenon that especially impacts the semi-arid lands of the Northeast. To deal with the various impacts of a current multi-year drought (2010-ongoing), the Government of Brazil, led by the Ministry of National Integration, partnered with the World Bank (WB) on a technical assistance program to foster proactive drought policy and management. The program works across sectors (climate/meteorology, water and sanitation, agriculture, environment, and disaster risk management) and levels (local, riverbasin, urban, state, regional and federal) in relation to the outcomes and stakeholders it aims to engage and influence, and trough the integration of WB Global Practices and programs. Inspired by successful models and lessons from other countries, the program aims to contribute to greater climate change resilience and reach a broad community of beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, partners convened to (1) build a Northeast Drought Monitor; and (2) pilot drought preparedness plans across Northeast. This chapter showcases the program and highlights key-milestones and direct and indirect outcomes identified by 2015. The institutional change process was assessed using qualitative analytical tools that integrate Outcome Mapping, the Capacity Development Results Framework, and Outcome Harvesting. Strengths, challenges, and outcomes (institutional changes) were identified, by tracking the programâs contribution throughout its duration and at its completion. The evidence shows that the initiative was able to convene key-regional and federal level multi-sector stakeholders at a decisive moment, resulting in an unprecedented bottom-up and regionally-led collaboration.

320,123,0.366,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Even if all political targets are met, climate change is expected to increase temperatures within the next decades globally and to change climate regimes locally, resulting in shifting water regimes and extreme weather events. In Central Europe temperatures are expected to increase and the climatic water balance, especially in summer, to decrease (see Sect. 3.3.1). Consequently, adaptation to climate change will become a necessity. Thus, it is crucial to overcome the notion that accepting the need for adaptation implies admitting the failure of climate policy. In fact, there are some instruments which provide high synergies between adaptation and mitigation, for example, in the area of forest conservation or ecosystem based adaptation as defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In short, adaptation to climate change is becoming increasingly important for nature conservation management. But adaptation to which specific climate change impacts? One answer is expected to come from the area of modelling. Modelling is increasingly important for understanding and projecting climate change impacts. Hence, model results can serve as a basis for adaptation. However, there is a gap K.

182,158,0.365,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Subsequently, as contributors to the deepening depression in agriculture, their continuing deaths encouraged the state to assume some responsibility for this activity. Throughout, sheep exerted influence over how and where research was practised, and by whom. In the earlier period, the symptoms they suffered, and the geography and seasonality of their diseases, reinforced agricultural sponsorsâ perceptions of them as products of place, and led to their positioning at the hub of research networks populated by experts in their bodies and environments. Their tendency to fall ill at particular times and in particular places shaped the questions that these experts asked of them, and led to their investigation on farms. State-funded researchers in the early twentieth century paid less heed to the farmed environment and conducted narrower, discipline-specific, laboratory-based enquiries that were underpinned by their different perceptions of sheep as hosts and transmitters of infection. However, their non-human subjects forced them to return intermittently to the field. Throughout, the sheepâs variable responses to both disease and scientific investigations generated a host of conflicting claims about their diseases. Their acknowledged importance as research subjects also encouraged ambitious veterinarians to enrol them in a campaign for professional advancement, which drew strength from the lengthy and intimate relationships that vets claimed to have developed with them. In the course of these activities, sheep built relationships between diverse human and non-human actors including: scientific experts and the state; the microbes, parasites and environments implicated in sheep diseases; the human and animal victims of analogous diseases that helped to shed light on sheep; and the multiple species of experimental animals that acted as sheep proxies. Through these relationships, sheep were awarded new roles as patients, pathological specimens, experimental material, culture media, victims and shapers of their environments, subjects of field trials, hosts and transmitters of infection, food for parasites, points of comparison with other species, and commercial products. Made and remade in the course of scientific enquiries, the sheepâs identity was in a constant state of flux. Their lived experiences also changed. As scientific subjects, sheep underwent clinical monitoring and treatment, feeding trials, dipping, experimental inoculations, parasitic infections, and premature, purposeful deaths. This had ramifications for farmed sheep, which were treated by dipping, drenching, dosing, isolation, managed grazing and restricted breeding in efforts to promote their health."

A âsystemâ, from a systems thinking perspective, is made up of entities that are linked through flows and interactions, with inputs and outputs. For EWS as a âsystem of systemsâ this includes for example monitoring, forecasting, warning generation, communication, emergency response and feed-back systems as well as their legal and institutional basis, and the people involved. EWS need to focus on vulnerabilities as part of the day-to-day lives of the people they serve who display different forms and degrees of vulnerabilities and capacities. Kelman and Glantz (2014) argue that EWS are a social process that involves technical components embedded in their social context, which contrasts with technical views that an EWS comprises only the technical equipment detecting or forecasting a hazard event and sending its parameters to a decision-making authority. This process is on-going and rooted in day-to-day and decade-to-decade functioning of society and is not only triggered when a hazard is about to strike. It is used to educate people, train them about response (e.g. through drills), gather baseline data and map risks. In fact it can be observed that there is a narrower understanding of EWS (i.e. detection, monitoring, modelling, and forecasting of the hazards as well as warning preparation and dissemination, based on risk knowledge and legal/institutional arrangements), and a wider understanding of EWS (i.e. corresponding to the 4 components) as adopted by EWC III in 2006. Both are widely in use. The problem with this wider understanding of EWS is that an EWS then becomes almost indistinguishable from DRM. EWS also apply to long-term, âcreepingâ changes that can change baselines and indicate trends â often only recognised once a speciï¬c threshold is crossed and often not being hazards per se but influencing other hazards and slow-onset hazards in addition to the quick-onset ones. For example, while climate change may not be a hazard itself, the process could still be warned of, partly to address the causes and partly to deal with the consequences. In this regard the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) can be understood as an EWS for climate change by assessing and synthesising climate change science and presenting actions that are needed. In theory, the earlier a warning is available, the more time there is to prepare for and hopefully respond effectively to the potential impacts of stressors, threats and hazards. An EWS for slower and gradual changes should therefore give more time to design prevention and adaptation to new hazard regimes, plan a response and integrate that response into day-to-day life and longer-term development. No single agency can be responsible for all EWS-related activities. While there may be an ofï¬cially designated EWS"

78,368,0.365,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"If action is indeed characterised as a beginning whose consequences can never be undone, scientific discoveries and technological developments are action by excellence, as they cannot be undone and correspond to new beginnings. Thinking about what happens to us and framing the challenges in a hyperconnected era is one of our generationâs tasks, and this ought to be done by balancing fears with confidence and control with wonder. Indeed, to reinforce and nurture the public space in a hyperconnected era, there is an urgent need to balance the omniscience-omnipotence utopia, pervaded by fear and control-seeking, with the plurality and natality perspectives, pervaded by confidence and wonder. This balancing generates a space where fears and risks are compensated by the confidence in beginnings, shared intelligence and practical wisdom. It generates a space where meanings are rooted in âin-betweensâ rather than in âthe more, the betterâ and where challenges are approached with âboth/andâ dualities rather than with âeither/orâ dilemmas. To some extent, it invites to shift away from the dominance of a risk governance approach to a literacy approach. Literacy is the set of skills, understood in a wide sense, which enables the experience of plurality. Hence, abilities to communicate are central to literacy understood in the wide sense. In a pre-digital context, literacy is about reading and writing, but it goes much beyond the technical ability and reaches out to the ability to understand, to contextualize and to be persuasive. For example, each of us learn very young and, most often, very painfully, the subtleties of communication. We all experienced the differences between what we want to say to our mother or to our best friend, or between what we want to say in confidence, and what we want to say loud and clear. When things go wrong, we learn and we adapt, and little by little, we acquire that extended literacy. Literacy is made of a mix of technical, social and ethical skills and considerations. It is also highly evolutive."

302,489,0.365,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Once in natural water bodies (rivers, lakes, oceans), recovery of microplastics is impossible. Therefore, one challenge is to identify and quantify the upstream sources â a prerequisite to mitigation. In the cases of microbeads and preproduction pellets, we witnessed the role of science to present observations of microplastic pollution, followed by a movement to pressure policymakers to regulate industry. The work of scientists continues to illuminate microplastic impacts, such as recent reports from the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) [118], a working group gathered by UNEP to synthesize and report on the state of the scientific evidence regarding the plastic pollution issue and distribute the information to the United Nations Environment Assembly. There are four principal solutions that will have high impact on preventing terrestrial and freshwater microplastics from forming. They are: (1) identify and quantify terrestrial microplastic sources, (2) scale zero waste strategies, (3) pursue policy-driven EPR, and (4) develop novel business solutions. These solutions will bring greater alignment between stakeholders on the utility of plastic in society and a more equitable end-of-life, where environmental and social justice are integrated in the full cost of plastic. The bridge between the linear and circular economy is about material circularity coupled with a sincere investment in common decency and democracy, and corporate responsibility toward those ends, what Severyn Bruyn calls a Civil Economy, whereby government, business, nonprofits and civic groups âcan develop an accountable, self-regulating, profitable, humane, and competitive system of marketsâ [119] (Bruyn 2000). This a thoughtful approach that considers the chemistry of materials, the design of products, the processes required to make things, and finally the systems that manage how materials flow back into the production chain, all in the context of causing no harm to people and the environment, benign by design in its totality.

192,337,0.364,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Solar quite convincingly explains how, as a young researcher, Michael Beard had been an isolated, introverted, highly committed, hyper-individual quantum physicist. As an ageing scientist, however, his situation has completely changed. A new arena of âconverging researchâ has emerged, in the intermediate zone between nano-technology, photovoltaics and climate politics. From the 1950s onwards, physicists (with their high-tech contrivances and advanced mathematics) migrated towards the life sciences, employing their powerful physical technologies to understand and mimic the basic processes of life. Artificial photosynthesis, as a sub-field of biomimesis (i.e. the use of biotechnology to mimic living nature on the molecular level), is an exemplification of this trend. Thus, the epistemological backdrop of the narrative is a transformation that is actually taking place in laboratories world-wide, where biotechnology is evolving into bio-mimesis, i.e. mimicking (âcopy-pastingâ) nature on a molecular scale (Church and Regis 2012; Zwart et al. 2015; Blok and Gremmen 2016). In principle, this biomimetic turn entails a positive ambition. The aim is to develop technologies which, although highly advanced, are nonetheless more sustainable and naturefriendly than the technologies which humankind managed to produce so far. Indeed, artificial photosynthesis basically aims to see plant leaves as biological factories from which human technology still has a lot to learn in terms of efficiency, sustainability and circularity. Nature is the paradigm, the teacher (natura artis magistra) for molecular life scientists and bioengineers, notably on the quantum or nanoscale. The down-side is that there is a lot of investment, prestige and politics involved in this type of research, so that it runs the risk of becoming tainted by privatisation, commercialisation and politicisation. This transformation (presented in Solar as an emerging scientific-industrial ârevolutionâ, p. 36, p. 211, p. 336; as a ânew chapter in the history of industrial civilisationâ, p. 293) is quite credibly reflected in the novel, and it is clear that author Ian McEwan has conducted a considerable amount of preparatory research.1 Although Beard is said to hold âan irrational prejudice against physicists who defected to biology, SchrÃ¶dinger, Crick and the likeâ (p. 121), he basically follows in their footsteps, moving from âpureâ quantum physics2 to âappliedâ molecular life sciences research. Yet, the most dramatic discontinuity in his career is not the shift from basic physics (studying photons and electrons) to biomimesis, but from original research"
278,94,0.364,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Prospective IE models combine central features of the established IE methods into a new framework. They allow researchers to conduct comprehensive and dynamic scenario analyses of societyâs future metabolism and to study the potential systemwide effect of sustainable development strategies. The development of these models is motivated by the desire to study the coming socio-metabolic transition and to assess the different transformation strategies at full scale and with long-term scope, while maintaining the high level of detail and biophysical consistency that is a distinctive feature of industrial ecology methods. The intellectual framing that comes along with the prospective IE models provides a ânew slangâ for the field: It broadens the perspective of industrial ecology research because it gives impulses for the development of new and important research questions for further refinement and integration of assessment methods and for the development of a common, modelindependent database of socioeconomic metabolism. The recent development in industrial ecology methods necessitates a discussion about the relation between prospective IE models and IAMs since the latter are the major tool for prospective assessment of transformation strategies. We contributed to this debate by proposing how industrial ecology principles could become an integral part of integrated assessment models and how this integration could strengthen both fields and increase the relevance, robustness, and credibility of scientific assessment of transformation strategies.

10,397,0.364,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"As presented in the previous chapters, to enhance the preparedness of NW European regions for periods of drought and water scarcity, the governance team used a governance assessment tool (GAT) to reveal the âessenceâ of drought adaptation and governance in the six NW European regions investigated (see Chap. 3). We should remember that this governance assessment has been developed by social scientists with the help of practice partners (project partners from the region, such as water authorities and county councils) and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. This inclusion of practice partners has allowed a continuous iteration between science and practice, as well as access to regional stakeholders for interviews; in addition, it ensured an even representation of the relevant stakeholders. The contacts and networks of the practice partners facilitated the exchange with these regional stakeholders. This âGovernance Assessment Toolâ is composed of a âmatrixâ style model that consists of ï¬ve elements (levels and scales, actors and networks, perceptions of the problem and goal ambitions, strategies and instruments, and responsibilities and resources for implementation) and four criteria (extent, coherence, flexibility and intensity), producing a matrix of 20 cells.

187,50,0.364,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"human behaviors in the case of crisis, e.g. overloading communication system or collective panic reactions. In [1] it is stressed that cyber interdependency tends to become an absolute and global characteristic of all the infrastructures, while other types of interdependencies are more local. Cyber dependency potentially couples an infrastructure with every other infrastructure that uses the cyberspace, in spite of their nature, type or geographical location. A different, but similar, classiï¬cation can be found in [9] where the authors consider: Physical, Geospatial, Policy, and Informational. Using a dataset on CI disruption incidents, empirical analysis [10, 11] showed that interdependenciesâmutual dependenciesâseldomly occur. Newer analysis shows that the only interdependencies that are mentioned in press reports occur at a lower, component or subsystem, level of abstraction. No âshooting in oneâs own footâ has been observed where A depends on B, B on A, and the disruption of A causes B to get disrupted causing A not being able to recover at all as Bâs critical functions are disrupted. Using this understanding, Nieuwenhuijs et al. [6] concluded that the set of âinterdependenciesâ presented by Rinaldi et al. on 2001 needed a reassessment. They stated that the geographical interdependencies are not dependencies but they are the result of a common mode failure (e.g. astorm) and that the mentioned âinterdependenciesâ are just âdependenciesâ. Dependencies are not a binary on/off phenomenon but shall be seen as the service level of quality (or set of qualities), e.g. the triple pressure, biological purity, and chemical purity of drinking water. Only when the service level drops below the expected service level, a dependency may cause a âcascadingâ disruption in the dependent function, service, or infrastructure. The degradation and recovery characteristics for each quality are infrastructure speciï¬c functions, such as the slow loss of pressure in drinking water pipelines after the failure of the distribution grid pumps ampliï¬ed by on-going demand, and the slow system recovery as repressuring takes time. Their analysis also shows that those who analyze CI dependencies also need to take into account the mode of operation. The daily set of dependencies (normal operations) may be very different from the set of dependencies when a CI has been disrupted (stress mode of operation), the dependencies in the crisis mode of operation, and during the recovery. For instance, a hospital is not dependent on diesel fuel, diesel trucks, truck drivers and lumbermen for their normal operations. But when a big storm hits and downs power lines, the backup generator starts. When the diesel tank starts to run dry, the hospital needs to order diesel, requires diesel transport (fuel loading, truck, driver) and a road cleared from toppled trees. Alike, for recovery, one may need an extraordinary large crane to repair critical infrastructure. To identify such sets of shifting dependencies it is required the analysis of the scenarios beyond the analysis of a disruption of a single CI. In [12], it is emphasised that, to correctly understand the behaviour of these infrastructures, it is mandatory to adopt a three-layer model:"

192,44,0.364,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Before addressing Lacanâs views on scientific integrity and research misconduct, I will first outline his views on science as such. For Lacan, science basically entails a process of symbolisation which proceeds via instruments and gadgets (1972â 1973/1975, p. 104), producing discursive âemissionsâ on a massive scale. Modern science eliminates (âdecomposesâ) the world as we know it from naÃ¯ve lifeworld experience, replacing it with a completely different kind of universe, composed of symbols (signifiers) referring to concepts (molecules, electrons, quarks, etc.) that represent enigmatic entities whose ontological status (whose materiality or realness) poses a challenge to human imagination (1972â1973/1975, p. 49). The progress of science is the progress of the symbolic order, consuming, incorporating, transforming and obliterating nature as described by Aristotle (1980), namely as ÏÏÏÎ¹Ï: that which emerges, comes forward on its own accord, having its own inherent principles of change, that which is simply there, without our doing. Nature becomes obliterated and dissolved in the course of the ongoing symbolisation or hominisation of the planet (Lacan 1953â1954/1975, p. 291). Science notably entails a symbolisation of the phenomena of life (1954â 1955/1978, p. 43). Rather than understanding life as such, the aim of science is to understand specific bio-molecular processes with the help of instruments and contrivances, such as clocks, microscopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), etc. (1954â 1955/1978, p. 96, p. 344) resulting in symbols (letters, figures, formula, graphics, etc.) of various kinds: a form of understanding which does not allow us to see living nature as it is, but rather aims to control and manipulate biological processes. Scientific explanation depends on the use of signifiers (discursive elements which are easily modifiable, notably when sitting in front of a computer screen) which structure scientific experience (1955â1956/1981, p. 216). Thus, symbolisation is the language of precision technology and relies on technologies of knowledge Â© The Author(s) 2017 H.

Thus, collaboration emerges as a common vision, central for the resolution of wicked problems as well, which demands the active leadership of professionals to enable the interaction among stakeholders and to create participatory solutions to specific challenges. In this chapter, a newly emerging professional, the bioeconomist, is introduced and described as that catalyser and enabler of collaboration for the transition from a fossilbased economy to a bioeconomy, a systemic shift that involves multiple complex challenges, goals and agents. Therefore, bioeconomy professionals are expected to be specialised in one field but also able to understand the scientific language of associated disciplines. Furthermore, the increase focus on innovation and interdisciplinary teamwork has created new student profile expectation to deal with global challenges and find sustainable solutions. In this regard, the formation and development of special competences through inter- and transdisciplinary learning is fundamental."

The numbers of considered levels depends on the application type. The threats are also speciï¬ed by their magnitudes/strength, such as: the magnitude of an earthquake, the quantity of the rain, the amount of released radioactive substances, the speed of the wind, the rate of water level increase in a flooding river, Very often, one may uses the term âintensityâ to specify threats. One says âan earth quake with high intensity. It causes the death of some hundreds of victims and some thousands of displaced personsâ. Using the term âintensityâ, people refer rather to the impact of the threats and the associated CIsâ disruptions. In our methodology, we keep the term âintensityâ to measure the consequences of the impact of the threats and the corresponding CIsâ disruptions on their environment. Similar to the double use of metrics (quantitative/qualitative) in specifying the threats, engineers and crisis managers use both kind of metrics (quantitative/qualitative) to specify the consequences (impact) of a given crisis. Consequences can then be measured using different types of natural metrics: number of injuries, fatalities, evacuated persons, destroyed buildings, inaccessible roads, loss of services (transport/water/communication/heating/electricity) and ultimately loss of governance/public unrests. Once one identiï¬ed and speciï¬ed the threat, one still need to know how to model and simulate them."

There is still a lack of transfer from existing scientific knowledge into conservation strategies and measures. Especially, the social effects of climate change and their impact on conservation management are not well addressed, even though they frame its decision context (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). Most of the available concepts and guidelines for the adaptation of conservation management are lacking connection to local strategies and actions. There is an urgent need for more science-practice partnerships to identify strategies that are robust to uncertainty deriving from climate projections and their ecological consequences. In addition, easy applicable tools are needed that provide no-regret options for adaptation, based on available scientific information. The adaptation of conservation management is a huge task and has to overcome multiple challenges on local level: â¢ The lack of resources: local conservation management is chronically scarce of resources like budget and manpower. New challenges like climate change are therefore hard to tackle. â¢ The lack of expertise in adaptation issues: on a local level there might be several experts trained to identifying effects of climate change, but only few are trained in adaptation issues. â¢ The lack of guidance to find suitable data and methods: in the last years an overwhelming amount of data and information on climate change and its effects has become available. A plethora of approaches and data has been published making it hard to identify relevant information and useful methods. â¢ The lack of suitable monitoring methods: signals of local climate change and its effects are hard to distinguish from the noise of natural dynamics. Robust methods helping to disentangle the web of pressures like land use and climate change are still rare. â¢ The lack of management methods: conservation experts in the field need simple, applicable tools and guidance for decision support in everyday management of conservation sites. They need methods to identify climate change related conflicts, to identify robust adaptation strategies, to choose suitable management measures, and to prioritise action. â¢ The lack of tools for communication and awareness raising: effective adaptation of conservation management needs to build public, as well as political, support for local adaptation activities. Tools for communication and participation are needed to foster environmental education, to illustrate effects of climate change, to show the relevance of adaptation measures, to guide autonomous adaptation of other land users, and to include stakeholders and the wider public in the adaptation process. Despite the existing gaps and challenges, local conservation management cannot hesitate to take action and must proceed in the face of considerable uncertainty (Conroy et al. 2011)."

Examples range from medical outposts in rural communities run by foreign missionaries (Good 1991) to the early infectious disease programs of the Rockefeller Foundation (Fosdick 1989) and from medical services and training programs for indigenous populations set up by colonial authorities (Marks 1997) to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) established by a collective of sovereign governments (Cueto 2007). Two complementary sets of factors provide context for understanding collaboration in global public health: first, the factors that inform globalization generally and global health specifically; second, the factors that shape ethical standards for global health programs generally and global health research specifically. Good examples of both factors are reflected in this chapterâs case studies."

As is typical of risk assessments of pesticides, this exercise required a range of expertise. The panel consisted of seven scientists with experience in environmental fate of organic molecules and associated simulation modeling, toxicity of pesticides to aquatic and terrestrial organisms, environmental chemodynamics, and ecological risk assessment. The panel developed conceptual models and an analysis plan that addressed the issues identified by the registrant, the panel, and in the problem formulation process developed by the USEPA. All panel members participated in all aspects of the problem formulation and goal-setting for the assessment. Individual experts took the lead in conducting various portions of the assessment. The assessment built upon the findings of the previous assessments, updated the data sets available, and applied the most current methods and models for assessing risks. The panel met several times over the period 2011â2013, discussed the findings of the various teams, and then prepared a series of peer-reviewed manuscripts, which are published together as a series in this volume of RECT. All of the papers were reviewed by anonymous reviewers. In particular, the panel addressed the following specific issues raised by the Environmental Fate and Effects Division of the USEPA and others:"
180,449,0.363,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"researchers, sponsors, or governments owed any continuing obligation of care to research participants at the end of a study. The bioethics principles developed over three decades by Beauchamp and Childress (2009) provided a formidable foundation upon which debates about research and health care could be played outâeven in the face of critiques about their adequacy and sufficiency as moral theory (Clauser and Gert 1990). Other principles have been recommended by scholars (Lavery et al. 2007) and organizations (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] 2005), but even proponents of principle-based approaches recognized that more was needed to meet challenges in emerging areas of science (e.g., public health genomics and transborder studies) (Lavery et al. 2007; Emanuel et al. 2008; Macklin 2008). Indeed, early in the tenure of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) that later reported on the ethics of clinical trials (NBAC 2001), Ezekiel Emanuel proposed that the Commission review the Belmont Report principles. He urged the Commission to adopt a new principle to its canon of bioethics, namely a principle of community to accommodate ethical issues arising from the recruitment of groups. Although the Commission did not adopt this principle, Emanuelâs proposal has since emerged as one of several benchmarks for assessing ethical acceptability of clinical research in developing countries (Emanuel et al. 2004). More relevantly, the concept of community engagement and participation has taken on a greater role in discussions about the importance of partnerships. The cases by Timms and by Lee, Kleinfeld, and Glassford illustrate the utility of using ethical principles to frame the unique challenges of global collaboration in biomedical research. Timms raises a critical issue about whether a multinational pharmaceutical company conducting clinical trials in an LMIC is responsible for harms sustained by research participants during its investigations. The ACTG-076 debate has broadened the question of accountability, recognizing that impoverished and poorly educated populations living with underdeveloped regulatory, health, and social service infrastructures must prompt reassessment of a multinational trial sponsorâs ethical obligations. Such reassessment has focused, naturally, on measures that prevent exploitation of vulnerable and desperate individuals in LMICs (e.g., appropriate informed consent, vigilant recruitment practices). But it has also raised the question of whether foreign sponsors and researchers have an ethical obligation to the host community or country supplying the large and diverse recruitment pool at comparatively lower cost. In the case described by Lee, Kleinfeld, and Glassford, a researcher must determine, apart from questions of scientific validity and potential health utility, whether proper informed consent was obtained in the acquisition of data and tissue samples being used for research on which she has been invited to collaborate. These data and specimens were gathered using various consent methods from six African countries, none of which had ethics review boards or national research guidelines. Her collaborator assures her that the consent modalities applied, though varying widely, were appropriate to the settings in which they were used. In deciding whether to coauthor an article based on acquired data, the researcher must consider how (or whether) the requirements of informed consent, a foundational principle of ethical research, can"

309,316,0.363,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"In 2007 and 2008, the world was gripped by a dramatic food crisis, as a confluence of factorsâincluding the rising price of oil and oil-derived inputs like fertilizer and the dwindling of reserve food stocks across the Global Southâconspired to drive the prices of staples like wheat and rice to record heights (Brown 2012). The crisis revealed new sources of instability lurking within the global food system, as grain traders took advantage of financialized commodity markets to reap speculative profits, driving up staple prices in the process, and as a growing reliance on food imports left countries around the world fully exposed to volatility in world price levels (Clapp and Cohen 2009). Across the Global South, high prices and scarce supplies touched off food riots and social unrest, culminating most dramatically in the uprisings that rocked the Arab world (Naylor 2014, p. 15; Barrett 2013; Patel and McMichael 2014). Even Vietnam, a country that has made massive strides in strengthening its food security in recent decades, was not immune to the contagion.1"

60,30,0.362,Research on Teaching and Learning Probability,"2.2.3 Causality and Conditioning Another component of probabilistic reasoning is distinguishing between causality and conditioning. Although independence is mathematically reduced to the multiplicative rule, a didactical analysis of independence should include discussion of the relationships between stochastic and physical independence and of psychological issues related to causal explanation that people often relate to independence (Borovcnik 2012). While dependence in probability characterises a bi-directional relation, the two directions involved in conditional probabilities have a completely different connotation from a causal standpoint. For example, whereas the conditional probability of having some virus to having a positive result on a diagnostic test is causal, the backward direction of conditional probability from a positive diagnosis to actually having the virus is merely indicative. Alternatively stated, while the test is positive because of a disease, no disease is caused by a positive test result. In many real-life situations the causal and probabilistic approach are intermingled. Often we observe phenomena that have a particular behaviour due to some causal impact factors plus some random perturbations. Then the challenge, often attacked with statistical methods, is to separate the causal from the random influence. A sound grasp of conditional probabilities is needed to understand all these situations, as well as for a foundation for understanding inferential statistics."

Being part of the process creates also gradually more enthusiasm among the farmers. Agricultural interests can this way become coherent with the interests of drought resilience projects that often imply forms of re-naturalization. This close collaboration of multi-stakeholders at levels of administration and project managers is a great advantage that provides coherence and enables successful implementation of measures. It can also be seen as a necessary and relatively successful adaptation to deal with an inherent rather than incoherent and fragmented governance context, labelled as the fragmentationâcoherence paradox. It is called a âparadoxâ because, while normally fragmentation would lead to stalemates and ultimately disinterest in the topic, in a context of sufï¬cient positive experiences with mutual cooperation it has led to a recognition that the various parties need each other and to the absence of fear that one of them will become too dominant. This âbeing part of the processâ creates enthusiasm with farmers. Trust between farmers and the government is extremely important. Otherwise also mutual social control among farmers will turn against collaboration or even selling agricultural land to the government. In terms of problem perceptions, drought resilience is not yet a fully shared priority. Instruments and strategies are not balanced and relatively fragmented in their consequences for implementation. As for responsibilities and resources, they are fragmented in a very complex way that only mutual consultations are the ways to proceed, creating the already above mentioned fragmentationâcoherence paradox."
320,136,0.362,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"modelling and the integration of stakeholders and decision-makers. Relevance, legitimacy, and transparency are considered key aspects for the acceptance and implementation of scientific results (Meinke et al. 2006). Before modelling efforts are started, existing knowledge should be examined to determine whether it is sufficient to support decisions and how the existing information can be translated to the relevant decision-making context. Modelling efforts use a lot of valuable resources for data acquisition, processing, model development, calibration, and validation. Usually these resources can be acquired in relation to research projects, but the limitation of resources must be considered if modelling approaches and procedures are transferred to a permanent task like conservation management. In the field of conservation management resources, whether manpower or budget, are chronically scarce and their use must yield the best possible output. Consequently, it is crucial to move modelling work beyond pure prediction (Dawson et al. 2011) and strengthen its integration in risk assessment, protocols of screening and monitoring, and integrated management in protected areas (Bellard et al. 2012). If modelling is to be integrated in management it must be based on an evaluation of the information need in protected areas. An assessment of its use in the management process must be done in order to guarantee maximum usability. The discussion of modelling goals and expected results will also guarantee the relevance and legitimacy of modelling endeavours. There is no doubt that modelling can provide various benefits for conservation management; however, the objectives of nature conservation need to be considered in modelling design, development, and presentation of results. Modelling for conservation management can be useful to: â¢ Structure the discussion about problems at hand and help develop hypotheses on consequences. â¢ Identify driving forces and hot spots where action is needed. â¢ Provide efficient and effective indicators to identify and monitor changes. â¢ Identify critical changes and thresholds to trigger action. â¢ Illustrate consequences of management options."

We explored the possibilities for obtaining urban health data in South Africa, focusing on maternal and child health, embedded within context. Similar to the layers of the ecological model, comprehensive urban health data requires information across multiple levels. A number of international and national organizations promote the principles of healthy cities. Goal 11 of the United Nationâs (UN) Sustainable Development Goals is to, âmake cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainableâ (UN 2017). The goal has targets for housing, transport systems, inclusive participation, cultural and natural heritage, deaths caused by disasters, adverse environmental impact, green and public spaces, regional development planning, integrated policies and plans, and sustainable and resilient buildings. The World Health Organization (WHO) supports health and sustainable development in cities by not only focusing on the health and health care infrastructure in cities, but also on the contribution of health care facilities on waste, pollution, and energy consumption (WHO 2017). WHO, UN, and other organizations have available resources for the promotion of healthy cities and for facilitation of actors in urban health related decision-making. Understanding the complex intersections of urbanization and health is therefore a major requirement for successful approaches to improve urban health. A comprehensive conceptual framework can help to orient academics, researchers, and health policy makers to the same page and a common language. Among various existing models, we follow Bronfenbrenner and Morrisâ (2006) conceptual model to explain the factors that affect urban health. Similar to other bioecological approaches, their model shows that health for an individual or a group is impacted by the following broad levels: individual, social and community networks, environment, and society. Mothers and their children are a specific group that can be studied using this conceptual model. Maternal and child health is a major area of interest for health, medicine, and public health for international and national organizations, as well as non-governmental and governmental organizations. Maternal health is concerned with outcomes such as maternal mortality, birth and pregnancy-related outcomes, perinatal mental health, feeding choices, or teenage pregnancies. Child health concerns issues such as infant and child mortality, nutrition, growth and development, early childhood disease, and immunization. In order to apply the model, individual factors such as age, gender, and race or ethnicity, need to be included. Social and community factors include family support systems and health facilities that are nearby. Environment factors include where a person lives, works, and engages in recreational activity. Societal factors include culture, socioeconomic, and government. The model shows that these levels are linked, and that they have mediating and/or moderating effects on health."
278,1,0.362,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Industrial ecology has come of age: it has its own journal, its own society and, in this volume, a first full retrospective â âtaking stockâ of its first quarter of a century as a scientific field. It is a remarkable achievement. To speak of society as having an industrial ecology would barely have been understood, as little as three decades ago. Early in the 1990s, I submitted an article for a newspaper with the phrase industrial ecology in it, only to have the editor send it back to me, corrected to industrial âeconomyâ. At the time, we all knew exactly what the industrial economy was (or thought we did), but clearly industrial âecologyâ could only be a typo. When I explained that it was not, the editor deemed it best to remove the term, because âno one would understand itâ. Two decades later industrial ecology is a clearer concept than industrial economy. The former even has its own Wikipedia entry; the latter, strangely, does not. Language is a curious commodity. Its malleability appears sometimes to be almost infinite. Meanings change and mutate over time, as intellectual territory is created and destroyed. We can respond to this linguistic contortionism in several distinct ways: at least two of them are wrong. One of the wrong ways is to suppose that the meanings embedded in terms are not just fixed but rightly so. We can spend a lot of time and energy defending the territory that language creates: defile my meanings at your peril; they are part of my identity and protect my legitimacy in the world. This is a subtly disguised variant on G. E. Mooreâs (1903) naturalistic fallacy: what is, is what ought to be; and woe betide offenders. The best way to avoid such an error is not to be too attached to the precision of language. Alternatively we can celebrate the loss of meaning in late, postmodern, advanced consumer capitalism, where nothing is any longer sacred, and definition counts for naught. Accepting this fluidity of meaning, it is all too easy to allow ourselves to float above rigour and define away contestation. In fact, a cynical variation on this theme is to deliberately employ such tactics to create your own territory. Academics throughout the ages have fallen foul of this. Let us put two unfamiliar words together and build a career from it. Come on; it is easy: epigenetic precognition, categorical"

252,40,0.361,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Establishing Ethical REsponsibilitiEs in thE contExt of Vaccination This chapter is about the ethical obligations or responsibilities1 pertaining to vaccination of three different actors. As we shall see in more detail later, there are three possible bearers of ethical obligations: individuals, collectives, and institutions (such as states). Thus, one could ask whether any individual has a moral obligation to have themselves or their children vaccinated against common infectious diseases, such as the seasonal flu, mumps, measles, rubella, and any communicable diseases that pose major threats to the health and even survival of individuals. Alternatively, one could ask whether our community, as a collective, has a collective ethical obligation to realize herd immunity and what it means to have a collective obligation. Or, again, one could ask whether institutions have an ethical obligation to enforce policies that ensure a communityâs realization of herd immunity against certain diseases. Since I am looking for a philosophical justification for any such ethical obligation, the central parts of this chapter will be rather technical in philosophical terms. Unsurprisingly, the fact that vaccination decisions need to be taken at three different levelsâindividual, collective, and institutionalâgenerates conflicts of values within and between these levels. In particular, when grounding any ethical obligation to be vaccinated or to vaccinate oneâs children, and when legitimizing any coercive policy that forces individuals to vaccinate themselves or their children, a first ethical problem may arise from a conflict between individual best interest and individual autonomy. A second ethical problem may arise from a conflict between individual autonomy and public health. If my arguments are sound, I will, by the end of the chapter, have solved both problems and provided a philosophical justification for certain ethical obligations at each of the three levels. Before presenting this philosophical justification, however, let me say something more about the two ethical problems I have just mentioned, so as to give the reader a clearer view of the challenges ahead. Let me start with the first problem, namely, the possible conflict between autonomy and best interest. With regard to child vaccination, one might think that it is quite uncontroversial to say that there is an individual ethical obligation to vaccinate oneâs children in order to protect their health: after all, being protected against an infectious disease seems From now on, I will use the terms âmoralâ and âethicalâ, as well as the terms âobligationâ and âresponsibilityâ (when referring to forward-looking responsibility), interchangeably."

278,389,0.361,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Whether âsolidaristicâ enterprises would be more receptive to such efforts and more adept at embracing such resource exchanges remains to be seen and would be an interesting area of future research. Another field of inquiry would be to ascertain to what extent companies already involved in symbiotic relations also embody social and solidarity values. Chertow and Ehrenfeld found that âone of the most distinctive elements of industrial symbiosis is that, while all industrial actors seek to reduce private costs and increase private benefits, those in the symbiotic networks that have been studied also participate in the creation of public environmental benefitsâ (2012: 18). Here, the SSE can contribute through an analysis of the profit structure, governance system, societal aims and, more generally, in better understanding the culture and values within such systems. Two other fields of inquiry involve the consideration of âsolidaristicâ crowdfunding as an opportunity for abating economy-wide rebound effects through the promotion of more socially just and environmentally sound investments; and finally, the potential for complementary currencies to work towards industrial ecology aims, such as reducing global carbon emissions. One of the weaknesses of the social and solidarity economy has been that of scale: although various institutions exist at the level of cities, countries and regions to federate activities across sectors, the actors within the SSE typically operate on a more micro scale. Over the past few years, there has been increasing attention to macroeconomic thinking in the industrial ecology and ecological economics community, questioning notions of wellbeing and prosperity, the inadequateness of current models and the need for transformative investments in the future (RÃ¸pke in Cohen et al. 2013; Jackson 2009; Victor 2008). As Tim Jackson put it âThe truth is that there is as yet no credible, socially just, ecologically sustainable scenario of continually growing incomes for a world of 9 billion people.â (2009: 86). The social and solidarity economy is not a magic wand solution and operates at the margins of the dominant capitalist economy, yet it is well underway and expanding, in research and practice. Reflecting on how the SSE and industrial ecology community might come together towards more macro-level perspectives would be a worthy exercise. One main outcome of this analysis is that transactions and exchanges are important flows, but more attention should be placed on the underlying values holding together our everyday practices and put forward in our economy, workplaces and society as a whole â including social and environmental values that are not always aligned.

As early as 5,000 years ago, especially after the start of human civilization, the area coverage by human colonization has been continually widened with the increase of population and progress of production technology, and environmental problems followed. Throughout the process of human development, the entire history is actually a process during which humankind kept fighting against and got adapted to environment. The Industrial Revolution of the UK occurred in the middle of eighteenth century indicates the coming of an industrial society era; when industrialization was providing the benefits of industrialized civilization and economic growth for humans, series of important environmental problems worsened in company with industrial globalization. From the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century to 1950, developed countries accounted for 95 % of CO2 emission. During the 50 years from 1950 to 2000, emission by developed countries still took up 77 % of world total. Once indicated by the General Assembly of the United Nations, âThe major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production, particularly in industrialized countries.â Especially after the 1940s when the unbalance between ecology and economy in fields like resource, energy and environment became increasingly out-standing, the issue of environmental protection began one of the biggest concerns of the public. Researches on environmental issues also broke the geographic restriction of nation or region, from catchwords to concrete course of action; certain organizations of developed countries even launched âstrong initiativesâ for global environmental protection. The representative ones include International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) founded in Switzerland in 1948 devoted to influencing, encouraging and assisting social organizations of the world to protect the integrity and diversity of nature and to realize sustainable development of ecology; World Wildlife Fund (WWF) founded in 1961 that advocates protection of biodiversity, ensuring sustainable utilization of renewable natural resources and promoting reduction of pollution and waste-type consumption and that has now established connections in more than 100 countries and completed over 10,000 environmental protection projects; Club of Rome, the first social group established for the purpose of solving the ecological"

182,355,0.361,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"ANIMAL PATIENTS Surprisingly little is known about the history of animal patients. This is partly because many animal victims of disease were not awarded this role: they were killed or left to suffer and die rather than being cared for clinically by owners and healers. It is also because historians have not tended to study the sorts of animals and diseases that resulted in the treatment of animals as patients. In focusing on the interests of humans rather than animals, their accounts privilege the effects of infectious animal diseases on the health of humans, animal populations and the agricultural economy.

365,717,0.361,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"1 Introduction In its most general definition, resilience is the ability of a system to react or cope with change. More specifically, the concept refers to the ability of a system to respond to shocks (temporary) or more persistent adverse trends (stressors) (Hoddinott 2014). In the context of food security, resilience means being able to achieve or maintain food security in spite of shocks or permanent stressors. This implies reducing the risk of becoming food insecure, increasing adaptive capacity to cope with risks and effectively respond to change over time.1 From the standpoint of CSA, of which food security is one key pillar, the importance of understanding resilience arises from the need to address the vulnerability of farm households to climate change, which is determined by a combination of adaptive capacity and exposure to shocks and slower changes (Adger et al. 2004; IPCC 2007a; OECD 2009; IPCC 2014). A conceptual framework for thinking about resilience is illustrated in Fig. 1. Adaptive capacity is affected by both the internal state of the farm household (education, age, farm area, assets owned, land productivity) and the external state experienced at the local level (technologies available, institutions, policies, infrastructure, markets). This is a dynamic system where the internal state changes over time depending on the outcomes of household decisions such as the crop mix, input use, production methods and off-farm activities. The outcomes are affected by climate (through yields) and markets (through prices) which are out of the control of the household. For example, a good season combined with strong markets helps build financial capital reducing vulnerability, whereas a string of poor seasons may result in loss of financial or human capital (by the selling of assets or migration of family members to the city), increasing vulnerability of the household. Both the internal and external states can change over time depending on policies, for example education and extension improve the internal state (human capital), whereas R&D and transport infrastructure improve the external state by providing new technologies and improving access to markets. Climate change affects the internal state indirectly by changing the yield probability distributions, for example due to increasing frequency of dry spells, floods and storms. It can also affect the external state, as in the case of severe storms destroying transport and communication infrastructure. Individual households make decisions based on the options available to them (Fig. 1), and their actions result in outcomes (i.e. profits) whose probability distribution is determined by both the internal and external state as well as by the changing climate. These influences are represented as dotted lines in Fig. 1. The dynamic aspect of the problem is represented by the solid arrow between outcomes and the"
75,149,0.36,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","As with blogs, the potential uses of microblogs for scholarly communication are highly varied, ranging from virtual journal clubs (Reich 2011) and debates about current, science-related events, to self-help for graduate students (for example, under the #phdchat hashtag). Microblogs are also a way for scientists to stay up to date about what their colleagues are working on, while at the same time providing a window into current scientific research for science journalists and facilitating interaction between scientists and the general public (Puschmann and Mahrt 2012). The lack of a dividing line between scientists and non-scientists, as well as the great variety of topics that even scientists tweet about mean that Twitter is not comparable to the orderly world of science publishing, where every piece of information is assumed to be relevant. Instead, a typical userâs timeline is likely to be populated both by scholarly content and personal remarks, more or less side by side. As the size of the network and the thematic broadness of Twitter is what makes it interesting to most users, it seems unlikely that this ââproblemââ will ever be remedied at its core, but the ability to filter information from Twitter and similar services is likely to resolve the issue.7 Tweets and other social media information can congregate around a journal article or piece of dataâan approach that may also be beneficial for the development of dedicated science services. Such services could eventually become a reality as the strengths of services like Twitter are at once also a weakness: while timely, tweets are not accessible in the long term, and increased brevity also means less nuanced information in each tweet."

The considerable volume of content that flows through ABATC make it a virtual popular science magazine, covering a breadth of issues and formats (including blog carnivals and other outreach mechanisms that aim to strengthen connections with other blogs). Zivkovic both relays information from other sources, commenting on it and explaining it to readers, and provides longer commentaries, for example on issues of science policy. He assumes that his readers are interested in science, but does not generally presume in-depth knowledge of scientific topics. This approach is in line with Zivkovicâs own background: while he is a trained scientist and writes from a first-hand perspective, his agenda is not that of someone paid for full-time research. While RRResearch presents both the results of research (rarely) and frames scientific issues for a scientific audience, ABATC translates scientific topics for a more general, non-specialist audience. The issues are much broader there than they are in RRResearch, where they align much more strongly with the bloggerâs own research interests. The latter blog is a window into the mind and daily work of the researcher, not a friendly conversation with a lay audience. This is not to say that RRResearch doesnât engageâits success illustrates how well it achieves this goalâbut whom it targets as its readership and what function it wants to realize remains at least partially unclear. Redfield uses her blog to frame issues for herself and her peers, while Zivkovic blogs for a readership with their needs squarely in mind. Much of the research that he relays is not his own, while much of what is discussed in RRResearch is Redfieldâs own work, or closely related to it. Whereas Redfield regards her blog as an instrument for communicating what she is currently working on or issues she is more generally interested in, Zivkovic provides a service and measures its success, at least in part, by its popularity and the amount of feedback he receives, a form of impact that may well be less relevant to a blogger like Redfield, who might be primarily concerned with her blogâs reception among her students and peers (Fig. 4)."
211,81,0.36,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"opportunities to preserve natural and communal environments to avoid harm to others in the society and the next generation. Finally, changes to natural and communal environments could also put individualsâ needs for autonomy at risk. In order to experience autonomy, individuals need to have a set of available options (Ryan and Deci 2000). However, with deteriorating environmental conditions, peopleâs options usually decrease. For instance, global warming has killed (or is killing) coral reefs (Tourtellot 2007), and climate change has also hindered the growth of crops and other nutritious plants in many areas, thus limiting the amount and diversity of food available throughout the world. Furthermore, when social groups are disturbed, peopleâs options for developing social ties with other individuals, especially other group members, are decreased. Thus, as these examples illustrate, the more natural and communal environmental changes lessen the options individuals have, the more their need for autonomy will remain unmet, and the more they will be inspired to focus on opportunities that preserve the environment. Peopleâs motivation to act on sustainable opportunities seems to increase as their physical and psychological health becomes progressively threatened. That is, the more threatened people feel, the more they tend to direct their attention toward the causes of that threat, and the less attention they tend to direct toward non-threat-related information (McMullen et al. 2009). Thus, when the threat to natural and communal environments is high, individuals are highly likely to act on opportunities to preserve those environments. The threat individuals sense from declining natural and communal environments likely affects the degree to which they combine their knowledge about entrepreneurship and their environmental knowledge to identify a sustainability opportunity. Generally, after individuals perceive a threat and overcome their initial fear response, they thoughtfully search for opportunities to deal with the threat (Beck and Clark 1997). While âelaborative strategic processing of threat,â people process information slowly and a âsecondary appraisal process occurs in which anxious individuals evaluate the availability and effectiveness of their coping resources to deal with the perceived threatâ (Beck and Clark 1997: 53). In other words, individuals whose psychological and physical health is endangered by environmental (natural or communal) deterioration will seek and assess opportunities to handle that threat and, in doing so, will be driven to utilize their prior environmental/communal knowledge as well as their entrepreneurial knowledge. As an individual undertakes assessment activities to deal with a threat, it becomes increasingly"

As a consequence, there seems to be a lack of plans or other instruments regarding drought adaptation, as well as a lack of long-term vision for this issue. This means that the district government is under no pressure due to obligations on the topic of climate change adaptation in general or drought in particular, and nor have the relevant resources been made available. Although they recognise the importance of the issue, they do not see themselves in a position to take it up, and so the district government is currently not driving any process (e.g. establishing its own guidelines, programmes, or implementing adaptation initiatives). It is individual actors that are initiating interesting activitiesâthe DROP project being one of them. The Waterboard Eifel-Rur, a drinking water producer and a hydroelectricity producer interviewed all emphasised the existence of technical projects to enhance the systemâs robustness, improve risk management and develop backup solutions in case of extreme events. We can say that drought prevention is being addressed in the context of general risk management strategies that use as inputsâ precipitation patterns. WVER can thus be described as the driving force of change in the region. As the responsible for most things water in the Eifel, they are also the ï¬rst in line to be affected by drought issues, which explains their taking a proactive approach. The overall assessment of the intensity is thus low, but with increasing strength."
314,230,0.36,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"overlap through adaptive capacity (Berman et al. 2012). Some scholars view resilience as an integral part of adaptive capacity, while others consider adaptive capacity as a main component of vulnerability (Cutter et al. 2008). Moreover, there are scholars that see resilience and adaptive capacity as nested concepts within an overall vulnerability structure (Cutter et al. 2008). Cutter et al. (2008) viewed resilience and vulnerability as separate but often linked concepts. As for Turner (2010), vulnerability and resilience constitute different but complementary framings. Some researchers employ the term âresilienceâ to the coping capacity component of its framework, whereas others view vulnerability as an antonym of resilience (Turner 2010). Resilience can be considered as adaptive capacity in the case that it is used with an emphasis on society while also integrating environmental characteristics (Malone 2009). In this chapter, resilience is investigated through adaptive capacity, although resilience is not assumed as a synonym of adaptive capacity. Scholars recognize the potential of social protection in reducing poverty and moving people into productive livelihoods (Davies et al. 2008). Social protection refers to all initiatives (public and private) which have the potential to reduce the economic and social vulnerability of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized groups, and social protection interventions can be classified as protective, preventive, promotive, and transformative measures (Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2004). Consequently, social protection can reduce poverty and move people into productive livelihoods, and is of paramount importance in helping the poorest to reduce their exposure to current and future climate shocks (Davies et al. 2008). Land tenure security is integral part of social protection (Mahadevia 2011). In SSA, the livelihood of rural communities depends on land as key natural capital (Scoones 1998). Therefore, land tenure appears to be central to vulnerability and resilience research, although it is often overlooked (Berman et al. 2012; Chagutah 2013). Land tenure varies across households, communities, and individualsâ characteristics such as gender and social groups. Higher levels of tenure security are considered to be associated with higher living conditions, human development achievements, economic status, and access to entitlements (Mahadevia 2011). Through land tenure security people have protection against their involuntary removal from their land without process of law (Mahadevia 2011). Secure land tenure militates for diversified livelihoods and favor investment in appropriate technologies and"

347,337,0.359,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"As mentioned above, Renn (2008) identifies four different forms or kinds of risk communication: documentation, information, dialogue and involvement. We find examples of all of these in our cases. In the cases of oil transportation, overfishing and eutrophication, communication can be characterised as one way from authorities to a wider public. It appears in the form of information such as statements, press releases and reports. Two-way communication and dialogue are sometimes established via different projects, which often include organised stakeholders as partners but not links to the general public. For example, in the case of eutrophication, research projects such as the Baltic COMPASS (Comprehensive Policy Actions and Investments in Sustainable Solutions in Agriculture in the Baltic Sea Region) and Baltic DEAL (Putting Best Practices in Agriculture into Work) involve farmers in BSR in the research process (see Haahti et al. 2010). There are different media and tools for communication to and with the public, for example, eco-labels, documents, reports, articles, laws and regulation, meetings and seminars. Our results point to the preference for using digital media platforms and webpages. Different actors however use different forms of communication. Whereas scientists use reports and articles, NGOs focus more on the use of the Internet and the organisationsâ webpages to inform the public. Through these channels, NGOs provide information, discussion forums and ideas on what the individual citizen can do to prevent or mitigate Baltic Sea-related problems. Awareness raising constitutes a key part of HELCOMâs communication policy. Its website states that âAn essential objective is to raise general public awareness of the Baltic Sea and HELCOM actionsâ (quoted in Dreyer et al. 2011). HELCOM also uses its website to communicate to a wider audience. Through its website HELCOM provides a large amount of publicly accessible documentation and information on the five cases. The information formats used, for example, indicator fact sheets and thematic reports, are primarily produced for targeted users at national and Baltic-wide levels. The website mainly meets the information needs of those who already express an interest in marine environmental risk governance. This is also the case with RACs in the fisheries case and relates to the question of who is"
234,33,0.359,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"Chapter 4 marks the shift in conceptualisation emerging from both our own evaluation and learning but coinciding with wider policy agenda. The missing piece of the jigsaw it seems was the failure to understand both conceptually and in terms of operational dynamics, the step from training through learning to individual behaviour change. We have learnt that knowledge mobilisation does not automatically derive from learning; knowledge in itself is not empowering and may, indeed, be disempowering. Knowledge mobilisation is highly contextualised and needs to be understood within the frame of wider human resource management systems. In marked contrast to the approaches favoured in health sciences focusing on âsystematic reviewsâ of published research on similar (identical) interventions, we undertook a much broader horizon-scanning research review process. Our aim here was to identify any knowledge or ideas that could facilitate our understanding of the interventionâfailure or systems stasis we were witnessing. Chapter. 4 reviews some of the work we identiï¬ed and its impact on our learning and volunteer deployment model. Chapter 5 applies the newly combined knowledge discussed in Chapter. 4 to two illustrative case studies. As we have noted, interventions in a project like the SVP take place and are modiï¬ed over time. In many ways they represent a simple âtrial and errorâ approach underpinned by intensive grounded research to facilitate our understanding of change processes or change resistance. Tracking the identiï¬cation of a âneedâ and our experience of designing and monitoring the evaluation of that process, in the light of the new knowledge gained through ongoing research review improves our understanding of the complexity of social processes. Chapter. 5 redeï¬nes the objectives of our action-research project from the starting point where we believed we were setting out to capture the ingredients of positive change to one of pro-actively understanding and learning from failure. It attempts, in the context of this potentially debilitating reality, to take stock and identify the characteristics of least harm interventions to chart the next stage of our journey."

178,243,0.359,Ethics Dumping : Case Studies From North-South Research Collaborations,"Genome editing allows the speciï¬c modiï¬cation of a genome; genes are modiï¬ed within their respective location in the genome, making the changes often indistinguishable from natural mutations. Developments of this technology such as the use of gene drives, where speciï¬c genes are spread within populations, or the use of viral vector systems, are enabling additional applications in environmental engineering and disease treatment. There are substantial individual and societal beneï¬ts from applying genome editing; nonetheless the technology also poses signiï¬cant risks to individuals, society as a whole and the environment. The central focus of this case study is on the unresolved ethical issues related to safety and security that pose both short-term and long-term challenges to international research partnerships. As such, the case study focuses not on a single incident but on the risks in the proliferation of a new and very powerful technology at a time when accepted and tailored ethical and legal frameworks at the international, national and local level are missing. In the case study two areas of safety risks are mapped and existing governance approaches described: ï¬rst, risks to humans, for example in relation to therapeutic applications of genome editing; second, risks to the environment in relation to the use of genome editing on animals, plants and microbes. In addition, two aspects of security risks are also assessed: ï¬rst, the creation of harmful agents relevant in the"

Finally, the number of stakeholders involved meant that it had proved very difficult and time consuming to have changes approved; for example, the five-year delay in reaching a decision on the 1974 FDA proposal to reduce the tolerance level of aflatoxin from 20 parts per billion (ppb) to 15 ppb. The NAS review was framed within the overall context of the decline in deaths from infectious diseases, the rise in those from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and the changes to the human environment brought by technological development.33 In the specific area of food, the authors pointed to technical advances having shifted hazards âaway from microbial contamination that produced acute disease soon after exposureâ, to âchemicals in small quantities and other hazards introduced by environmental contamination as well as by food production and processingâ.34 The recommendation for regulatory flexibility came from the aim of allowing agencies to find a middle way between unrestrained use and a ban, as well as a desire to allow them to keep up with progress in research, production and monitoring.35 In other words, the problem of aflatoxins was being defined largely in terms of the risks created by modern methods of food production, distribution and consumption; nonetheless, it was expected to be solved by those very same technologies.36 One factor, echoing issues with regionally specific fungi, was that risks varied with place and individual lifestyles, particularly dietary, meaning that national, let alone international, standards were likely to be hard to agree and even harder to enforce.37 Aspergillosis: âA Rare Diseaseâ, 1900â1960 Poultry were important in the story of Aspergilli fungi and human health at both ends of the twentieth century, as aspergillosis was recognised as a lung disease of fowl and cattle, and an occupational disease in humans around 1900.38 Veterinarians reported the disease to be most common in birds, including chickens, turkeys and certain waterfowl, where it caused pneumonia and other lung diseases.39 Mammals were said to be less susceptible, but it was reported in cattle and dogs. Veterinarians blamed contaminated grain, but argued that certain predisposing conditions were necessary, such as the animals being in poor general health or living in insanitary conditions. âBrooder pneumoniaâ, an American term for aspergillosis, came from its presence in intensively reared fowl. In humans, the disease was found mainly in those who worked with birds and cattle, those who handled grain or worked in dusty conditions. The primary presentation in humans was as bronchial or lung"

For example, when the risk of Covid-19 was communicated to the public in February 2020 (i.e. at the very start of the pandemic), it was important to find the balance between transparency and public panic. It was important to communicate so that it protects vulnerable populations (e.g. people with immunodeficiency problems). It is also important to avoid conflicts of interest. When communicating risks, we also need to consider legal frameworks and regulations. For example, we need to be compliant with privacy and data protection laws, with advertising and marketing restrictions, and with health and safety regulations."

97,445,0.358,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","The private sector (i.e. for-profit businesses) is a key partner to engage with in the process of meeting global biodiversity conservation targets. While the private sector can have negative impacts on biodiversity, it also has the potential to offer innovative solutions to urban challenges. Businesses can provide insights and perspectives which are complementary to those from governments and civil society. In particular, their knowledge of markets, management experience, and ability to harness advanced research and development to deliver solutions, can be valuable assets in the context of implementing NBS (IUCN 2012a). Many businesses are increasingly realising that their future depends (directly or indirectly) on natural resources and that solely relying on man-made infrastructure is not enough (Ozment et al. 2015). Man-made storm surge barriers, for example, can help protect harbours, but can also seriously increase surge levels in surrounding areas. River ecosystems throughout Europe have been severely impacted by engineering projects for flood protection, navigation, water supply and hydroelectricity; it is estimated that less than 20% of Europeâs rivers and floodplains are in their natural state (RESTORE 2016). A combination of measures is needed to tackle flood and climate change related challenges effectively. This must include land-use management and nature-based measures which embrace natural systems as a means of enhancing our well-being and reducing risk (Munich RE 2015). Growing oyster reefs, for example, can help to reduce coastal erosion and protect businesses from storm surges, while also filtering contaminated seawater and supporting local fisheries (RESTORE 2016). The importance and value of engaging with the private sector is aptly demonstrated in relation to climate change. According to a survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2014, 90% of business leaders believe that they have a role in building resilience and preparing cities for the impact of climate change (Kongrukgreatiyos 2014). This has already translated into action â in 2014, the private sector was the largest source of climate finance, devoting $243 billion to climate-related investments (Buchner et al. 2015). Partnerships between businesses, cities, civil society organisations, scientists and other urban stakeholders are crucial to showcasing the value of natural capital as the foundation for economic prosperity and human well-being, and help to bring about changes in business practices and leverage contributions from the private sector."
178,258,0.358,Ethics Dumping : Case Studies From North-South Research Collaborations,"Abstract The increase in the volume of health-related research in Africa has not everywhere been accompanied by improvements in research oversight systems related to biomedical and health services research, including the strengthening of institutional review boards (IRBs) and national regulatory oversight institutions. Critical to such oversight are not only competencies in ethics for the review of clinical trials, but also competencies in diverse research methods, statistical analyses and project implementation. In Liberia, there are recognized weaknesses in the existing infrastructure and capacity to regulate and monitor clinical research based on ethical institutional regulations and guidance for the protection of human research participants. During the height of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) surge in Liberia in 2014, there was a fragile national regulatory framework to oversee research. Some researchers took undue advantage of this gap to conduct unethical research.

378,2,0.358,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"In part, this is because of the simple but profound insight that forms one of the bases for this book that climate change and the combustion of fossil fuels that are the primary causes of the problem are not a matter of scarcity or inadequate economic development. Quite the contrary! The problem of climate change is a matter of too much fossil fuel that is easy to extract from the ground and burn to power all manner of human technologies. Applying economic reasoning premised on scarcity, shortage and the need to massively increase human energy use and hence produce necessities for human flourishing, to the problem of climate change, is a major conceptual and political error. Hence, the need for a fundamental transformation of policy discourses and of their intellectual underpinnings in modern assumptions and modes of thinking. A âmindshiftâ is very obviously needed. This is obviously in part about economics, and crucially about the idea that growth is the answer even if it is not clear what the question actually is. Maja GÃ¶pelâs âgreat mindshiftâ is also about a recognition that humanity has, albeit mostly inadvertently, changed its place in the planetary system by the scale and persistence of its activities. The introduction of the controlled use of ï¬re, agriculture, the selective breeding of domesticated species, complex tools, city building, industrialization, and now the construction of a global production and trading system based on fossil fuels have transformed both humanity and our habitat in fundamental ways. We have already postponed at least one, possibly two ice ages, and hence, the rich and powerful parts of humanity have effectively taken the future geological conditions of the only habitat we all have into their hands. All of which has led to the increasingly wide adoption of the term Anthropocene to specify present circumstances. These new recognitions, of both the problem of too much fossil fuel and the sheer scale of humanityâs actions, now require that we rethink many things. Just as modernity required a dramatic shift in thinking as part of what Karl Polanyi termed the great transformation to a commercial society based on the notions of interests, economic growth and relatively unregulated markets, the new conditions of living in the Anthropocene require new formulations and also new modes of human conduct. If the planetary habitat for future generations is to be kept even close to the conditions that humanity has known for its recorded history, we will have to âshift our mindsâ in a new transformation that incorporates the insights of earth systems science and numerous new research endeavours to build sustainable societies on new principles. Given that economic reasoning has become the way in which so much of human activity is described, interpreted and increasingly governed, a fundamental re-evaluation of its basic premises, of the scarcity assumption, the efï¬cacy of current modes of âgrowthâ and the quest for narrowly deï¬ned efï¬ciencies in markets, is long overdue. Hence, this volume, which tackles these key themes directly, is to be very much welcomed as a most useful and timely contribution to both the critical re-evaluation of the hegemonic thought processes and policy practices of contemporary economism as well as to new political, economic and, crucially, ecological thinking that breaks away from the increasingly counterproductive formulations in contemporary policy.

92,7,0.358,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"In the era of Sustainable Development Goals, multinational non-governmental organizations (NGOs), grand challenges, and record numbers of students seeking educational opportunities abroad, university global health partnerships are quickly becoming a mainstay (Merson 2014). These partnerships can bring together researchers, students, and community members in ways that address education, research, and community health needs. There are compelling advantages to having institutional partnerships so that individuals can collaborate to have a sustainable impact compared to working individually within institutions (Dockrell 2010). A collective base of expertise may also leverage scarce resources and help to develop creative solutions to intractable issues (Binagwaho et al. 2013). Frequently though, universities working together on these issues can reinforce existing disparities and unequal relationships that prioritize the flow of information, bodies, and agendas from higher to lower resourced parts of the globe (Crane 2010; Sewankambo et al. 2015; Syed et al. 2013). We take as a starting point that partnerships, if built, maintained, and managed in an equitable fashion have the potential to generate a lasting positive impact on global health (Chu et al. 2014; Morse 2014; Pratt and Hyder 2016, 2017). The concept of reverse and global innovation flow is central to this equity, and prioritizes the knowledge and expertise from what is frequently referred to as the Global South (Syed et al. 2013; Crisp 2014).

169,385,0.358,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"As testament to their reliable support for nature conservation and their serious interest in âï¬sh welfare,â recreational ï¬sheries/ï¬shermen have to work on strategies as to how (1) to use ï¬sh stocks in a sustainable way, (2) to protect healthy or to restore impaired habitats, and (3) to practice ï¬shing in a morally/ethically defensible way. In general, management is required wherever human activities negatively impact ï¬sh habitats or where commercial and/or recreational ï¬sheries use stocks in an unsustainable way. Next to those impacts the reestablishment of formerly endangered piscivorous predators (e.g., cormorants, otters), the spreading of invasive ï¬sh species (some of them introduced by ï¬shermen), or the consequences of global change comprise further interferences that can cause substantial problems for natural ï¬sh stocks. The probability that such problems combine or overlap is very likely in Europe, severely complicating the challenge of managing ï¬sheries sustainably. In the end, all potential problems of wild ï¬sh stocks are related to human activities. Therefore, the need to manage ï¬sh, ultimately, is always associated with human inï¬uences, attitudes, behavior, and expectations. Modern ï¬sheries management in waters dedicated primarily to recreational ï¬shing must try to merge nature conservation needs and the satisfaction of a still-growing number of anglers. The majority of Austrian running water bodies can be assigned to the rhithral and are predominantly colonized by brown trout (Salmo trutta) and other salmonid species, like the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and the Danube salmon (Hucho hucho). Similar to other Central European countries, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which was ï¬rst brought to Austria in 1886 (MacCrimmon 1971) and successfully established self-sustaining populations, evolved rapidly as a target species for recreational ï¬shing. Additionally, many anglers ï¬sh in natural lakes as well as other stagnant water bodies like artiï¬cial ponds, reservoirs, and ï¬oodplain oxbows, targeting a broader diversity of ï¬sh species. In this chapter we focus on the management of salmonid rivers and streams and present an example of a highly valuable trout ï¬shing beat in a pre-alpine river. On that basis we discuss the cornerstones of our understanding of sustainable ï¬sheries management, the tools ï¬sheries management can use and the restrictions or limits sound management has to address."
73,122,0.357,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"IWM has undergone several transformations, and although DRR is a more recent concept, it too has been moulded to suit speciï¬c local conditions at different scales. These evolutionary changes in both ï¬elds have sought to develop âself-generated processes of dynamic changeâ by a âsubstantial devolution of power to smaller territorial unitsâ within an overall system, thus we now see the emergence of community-based disaster risk reduction (Twig 2004) and participatory watershed management (McGregor et al. 2006; Gregersen et al. 2007), both of which can be suitably characterised by using elements of Friedmann and Weaverâs (1979) approach. However, the related connection between the two planning approaches is effected through the medium of water: as Gregersen et al. (2007: 2) highlight, âwater ï¬ows downstream, ignoring all political boundaries en routeâ and âmost of the things that people do to their land and water upstream affects the water quantity, timing of ï¬ow and quality downstream and, as a consequence, downstream land productivity in its various forms.â This applies equally in the context of disaster risk reduction as land use changes in the watershed can have profound implications for vulnerability as experienced by others (rural, urban and peri-urban) located downstream. This has clear ramiï¬cations in the context of rapid peri-urban change, particularly where marginalised lands are settled, and compounds vulnerability issues stemming from agricultural productivity in surrounding rural areas as well as urban water scarcity and food insecurity. In such scenarios, the watershed approach could be a crucial planning and policy tool for effective and efï¬cient management of natural resources, particularly in regard to reducing disaster risk and maintaining future food security in expanding populous urban cores, where high quality agricultural land is often a primary focus of conversion to other, more urban land uses. The watershed approach is equally important in the tackling of âwildlandâ ï¬res in the PUI, as water resources can form effective physical barriers for mitigation and ï¬re breaks, and natural water storage features become water reservoirs for ï¬re ï¬ghting operations. Wildï¬res regularly cause extensive devastation, affecting both poor and rich, in the USA, Australia, Europe (including Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece); and South Africa (Goldammer 2005; Ye 2005). The vulnerability stemming from problems associated with wildland ï¬res is particularly acute when the PUI is characterised by extensive forestry and tree-based systems as opposed to lands predominantly used for agricultural purposes. The demand for, and high value proï¬ts from, suburban development set in woodland areas exacerbates these issues which is one reason that wildï¬res often occur on the fringes of Australian, European and North American cities (Goldammer 2005; Ye 2005), although such risks and vulnerabilities are not unique to high-income countries; for example, wildï¬res have also devastated many periurban areas in Indonesia (Tacconi et al. 2007)."
347,292,0.357,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"There are two central spheres for the governance of chemicals in the marine environment within Europe of relevance for the Baltic Sea region: chemicals policy that takes a market perspective and environmental policy that is based on, for example, aquatic parameters which aim to protect health and the environment (Karlsson et al. 2011). Within the market sphere of chemicals policy, substances have been classified and further regulated in the EU since the 1960s. Over time, a strong risk-based foundation has emerged, implying that unacceptable risks must be proven in comprehensive assessment before risk reduction measures could be motivated. The ultimate manifestation of such a view is the Technical Guidance Document (TGD) of the EU, comprising thousands of pages of instructions for scientific risk assessments (see, e.g., ECB 2003), which is applied by experts in various advisory and"
278,373,0.357,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"industrial ecology community (Cohen-Rosenthal 2004), was consistently critical of reductionist strategies that would rely solely on engineering know-how, proper technologies and market-based incentives. For Cohen-Rosenthal, the focus should be on social processes, or the actual points of connection between material and energy flows, and specifically connections between people. Yet little attention is given in IE to the relation between interests, institutions and resources (Opoku 2004), and this dimension remains to be further conceptualized â although interest in this dimension has been growing in the past decade, as we will now turn to. IE engages with various tools, which are now considered a part industrial ecology approaches, including InputâOutput Accounting and Material Flow Analysis, as well as Life Cycle Assessments. The value of LCA has been to extend beyond the âend of pipeâ perspective, which only addresses final outputs, in terms of pollution and environmental degradation. Rather, inputs and outputs are described and can be quantified and qualified across the production-consumption chain, from extraction of natural resources, through manufacturing, distribution, usage and final disposal. In more recent years, social LCA has developed to consider the social impacts in the life cycle of products and processes (UNEP 2009; Andrews et al. 2009; Hauschild et al. 2008), with more recent work in developing a social hotspots database that includes a consideration of labour intensity and worker rights (Benoit-Norris et al. 2012) and on integrating occupational health and safety standards (Scanlon et al. 2015). One aspect of the social and solidarity economy is that the primacy of people over profit is not an âend of pipeâ gesture, but rather embedded across the economic activity in question, from its guiding principles and mission, to how salaries and employee benefits are organized, to how profit is shared. We will come back to this notion in the next section of this chapter, when we consider forms of âend of pipe sharingâ to distinguish more robust solidarity economy activities from âbusiness as usualâ. The notion of reciprocity, which is an important concept underpinning the SSE, is interesting to explore in relation to IE. If we continue with the notion of IE as being based on a metaphor, can we identify any forms of reciprocity in nature? In other terms, do we see cooperation or competition in natural systems? Ehrenfeld (2000) suggests that a balance is needed between both. Does altruism exist in nature? Perhaps something closer would be mutualism, which would suggest cooperation between members that lead to mutually beneficial or even neutral outcomes. For Ehrenfeld, ââ¦the power of the concept of industrial ecology lies in its normative context and in its potential to shape paradigmatic thinking. It is normative in the sense that (â¦) three features of the ecological metaphor â community, connectedness, and cooperation â are characteristics we should strive for in designing our worlds.â (Ehrenfeld 2000: 238). These three features, of community, connectedness and cooperation, are closely related to the social and solidarity economy and would merit being further conceptualized. We could draw on the work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809â1865) here, the father of mutualism in economic theory, who suggested that human activities could be mutualized towards the creation of a collective good. In terms of governance systems, the notion of voluntary engagement in complementary relations, which is important in the SSE literature, is not explicit in the IE literature. Forms of auto-organization are usually upheld as the preferred way of"
222,53,0.357,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"benefits to humans of ecosystem processes. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005) popularised the term and drew on findings across hydrology, systems modelling, development economics, resilience theory and others to advance the concept and its applications. Much of the effort in ecosystem services has been in delineating and classifying ecosystem service types and processes, and in mapping and measuring ecosystem services and their benefits (Nicholls et al. 2016; Naidoo et al. 2008). In addition, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment sought to characterise long-term future trends and sustainability through global and sub-global scenarios. The principal tenets of ecosystem service science are firstly that the observed decline in ecosystem services at all scales is widely caused by human action. The drivers of decline include the scale of economic activity, not least in extraction of renewable resources such as forests and fisheries, unsustainable pollution loading and the trade-off between the selective enhancements of some ecosystem services at the detriment of others (MEA 2005; Bennett et al. 2009). In the field of ecological economics, initial aggregation of the benefits of nature sought to make them commensurable, and to compare aggregate ecosystem service benefits to the scale of economic activity. Costanza et al. (1997) strongly argued that ecosystems provide unaccounted-for benefits to society that are of greater magnitude than the whole of the global economy by standard economic metrics. Assessments of interventions to preserve natural areas or conserve specific ecosystem functions show that such actions generate benefits that are often orders of magnitude greater than their costs (Balmford et al. 2002). Yet many elements of the relationship between ecosystems and the environment remain poorly established, not least in coastal and marine environments, such as deltas. What constitutes an ecosystem service, for example, comes into sharp relief in delta environments. In practice, classification systems for ecosystem services are based on both the characteristics of the ecosystem of interest and the decision-making context. Ecosystems provide direct provisioning for humans, through processes of cultivation or extraction of food and fibre. Ecosystems regulate the environment through absorbing and processing pollutants or acting as shelter, barrier or other elements of human habitat. Ecosystems also have"

232,347,0.357,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"well as collective representations and narratives about a societyâs past, present, and futureâhas become a common analytical tool in such ï¬elds as anthropology and sociology. Two recent insights regarding collective imaginaries are of particular relevance in thinking about the Fukushima disaster and its aftermath. First, social imaginaries are consequential for a groupâs social resilience. Reviewing empirical works (including their own) on groups facing various adversities (e.g., poverty, health disparities, discrimination, marginalization), Hall and Lamont [11, 12] argue that social imaginaries are constitutive of the collective capabilities of a community or society, as they not only bind its members with narratives of its past accomplishments and a vision of what it means to belong to it, but also indicate how its members understand what they are capable of doing together. Deï¬ning social resilience as âthe capacity of groups of people bound together in organizations, classes, racial groups, communities, or nations to sustain and advance their well-being in the face of challengesâ [11], they argue that imaginaries can provide signiï¬cant resources for such a capacity. For instance, social recognition and status of a groupâi.e., where it stands in collective imaginariesâshape capabilities of its members by influencing how they can secure support from others, as well as how they perceive their own efï¬cacy [11]. Put another way, how collective imaginaries specify and support group identities and deï¬ne who qualify as valued members of the collectivity can be direct sources of resilience for group members [12]. Conversely, when these imaginaries stigmatize a group, they constrain capabilities of its members. At the same time, groups might turn to collective imaginaries for tool to cope with difï¬culties: In coping with discrimination, members of marginalized groups in the United States often rely on such cultural resources as principles of equality as a key American creed (e.g., [26]), whereas a strong group identity has been found to alleviate the impact of adverse experiences. In sum, imaginaries serve as important resourcesâor constraintsâfor social resilience, independently of and consequentially for a groupâs access to material resources. Second, imaginaries play a signiï¬cant role in the way a society addresses science and technology. Jasanoff ([17]; also see Jasanoff and Kim [18]) argues that visions of future developments in science and technology are inevitably and intricately connected to collective visions of good and attainable futures, positing a concept of âsociotechnical imaginaries.â Deï¬ned as âcollectively held, institutionally stabilized, and publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technologyâ [17], this concept allows us to explore and better understand the complex interplay between developments in science, technology, and society. For instance, examining the development and regulation of nuclear power in the United States and South Korea, Jasanoff and Kim [18] identify different ways in which nationhood and nuclear power have been imagined together in the two countries, as well as how such different imaginaries illuminate their different responses to nuclear disasters and the spread of"

87,88,0.357,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","Fig. 3.8). These insights from general economic studies can also be applied to the bioeconomy. Ultimately, it depends on the actions of governments and/or private businesses whether opportunities that arise from chances or shocks are effectively used. For example, the oil price crisis of 1973 induced the government of Brazil to establish a National Alcohol Program in 1975, which subsequently played an important role in the development of Brazilâs sugar-based bioeconomy (cf. Scheiterle et al. 2017). Likewise, the nuclear disaster of Fukushima in 2011 was a major factor behind the political decision of the German government to get out of nuclear energy and focus on renewable energy, a decision referred to as âEnergy Turnâ (Energiewende)."
35,289,0.357,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"stakeholderâs sectorâ (Tiller et al. 2013). During the workshop the participants nominated Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) as an additional driver. They even coined it a âsuperâ driver, and felt it necessary as a pre-condition for the discussion as a whole. The exercise Tiller et al. (2013) conducted was thus to explicitly identify what attitudes and risk perceptions stakeholders have for offshore aquaculture. The concrete risks or effects they identiï¬ed were, among others, related to loss of income, to extra costs incurring due to loss of gear, and to being excluded from the ï¬shing grounds. All the effects they considered ï¬t in the social typology category of Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests. Forster (2008) sets out to tackle some broader issues related to offshore aquaculture, including how the potential of offshore aquaculture ï¬t into the bigger picture of global food supply, how the assessed long term potential of offshore aquaculture may be important in evaluating current efforts to get it developed, and how offshore aquaculture should be judged in comparison to other methods of food production.2 He looked into the anticipated future need and demand for food and hence seafood, but also into other ways of making more productive use of the sea, including for energy production and animal feed. He further discussed some of the criteria to assess the sustainability of offshore aquaculture, as well as some of the major substantial issues. Thus, his deliberations point out to the typology item Effects on the wider economic and innovation system. Lastly, a recent study by Ferreira et al. (2014) in southern Portugal investigated interactions between inshore and offshore clam aquaculture through a modelling framework. This enabled them to consider production volumes in the two contrasting aquaculture settings, as well as the environmental effects and disease interactions between them. They could show that whilst the inshore aquaculture activity targets clams of high value, a substantial part of the primary production which is food for the clams originates from the offshore. The offshore area has one of the worldâs ï¬rst offshore aquaculture parks, 3.6 nm from the coast. The park has 60 leases for aquaculture production, 70% for ï¬nï¬sh cage culture and 30% for bivalve longline culture, covers 15 km2 and is at 30â60 m depth. Ferreira et al. (2014) found that the bivalve offshore production has caused a decrease of clam yields inshore. While this is replaced by the yields offshore, it is a source of stakeholder conflict. The authorsâ modelling of potential disease spread between the offshore and inshore systems made it possible to develop a risk exposure map. The authors argue that such quantitative models of interactions, including reduced yields for inshore stakeholder, demonstrate a need for âstrong governance to offset disease risksâ, and they stress âthe need to go beyond the conventional spatial planning toolset in order to ensure an ecosystem approach to aquaculture.â These ï¬ndings ï¬t into the social typology categories of Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution; Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests."
284,209,0.357,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"principles for sustainable mining development (MMSD, 2002; ICMM, 2003). However, only one of ICMMâs 46 subprinciples refers to the responsible consumption of water and energy in mining. In the reference cases studied, the relevance of the consumption of water and mining is a theme of a âhigh levelâ and experts. It does not, however, seem to be picked up by other social actors. Similarly, references to water and energy consumption in the mining and environmental legislation of the countries studied are scarce (OCMAL, 2012). In the rules and regulations for environmental evaluation and monitoring, these issues are of secondary importance. In short, the analysis of institutional discourses elucidates the importance of the principles and good practices driven by transnational companies. They emphasize the role of international ï¬nancial agencies and institutions, such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC, 2012), and principles of environmental evaluation and report, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, 2011) and BellagioSTAMP (IISD and OECD, 2009). This study underlines the existence of basic social representations that favour environmental considerations. The interviewed actors in the four countries were asked about the environment, climate change, development models and the relationship of man with nature. They responded in a few typical patterns that show their views on water and energy consumption. Some stress the role of policies of social and environmental responsibility of the mining companies and institutions, reï¬ecting inï¬uential discourses at local and international levels. The alternative discourses, which oppose mining projects, resort to interpretational codes derived from a radical reconceptualization of the consumption of water and energy. They focus on their uses, meanings and valuations as associated with the notions of justice, and social and environmental rights. The statement against which interviewees had to declare their preferences is taken from the mainstream discourses in public policy, saying that â âSustainable developmentâ in the context of my countryâs needs would be an economic growth model that mitigates negative environmental and social impacts.â8 The responses were primarily âstrongly agreeâ, which dominated among senior public ofï¬cials and businessmen, and âdisagreeâ, which dominated among environmentalists and (college-educated) experts. We should take note of the emphasis on the idea of economic growth in this proposal, although it is certainly moderated by the idea of mitigating environmental and social impacts. Our results indicate that the concepts associated with growth that"
278,86,0.356,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"need a practical and scientifically credible implementation of the ideal represented by the hypothetical CLCA approach. In our opinion, prospective IE models provide such implementation. The scenario approach makes explicit the underlying exogenous assumptions that necessarily accompany any prospective model of an indeterminate system. Several authors, including Zamagni et al. (2012), Plevin et al. (2014a), and Suh and Yang (2014), acknowledge the importance of scenario modeling for the scientific assessment of decision-making in general and the questions posed by CLCA in particular. The use of a comprehensive model of societyâs metabolism allows us to study the system with the high level of detail and biophysical consistency that is a distinctive feature of industrial ecology methods. The combination of the scenario approach and a detailed model of societyâs metabolism make prospective IE models a powerful and scientifically credible approach to explore the potential consequences of decisions."

We started out with modeling a very specific case, namely the spreading of a flu among pupils and staff at a boarding school. With purpose we exchanged words like pupils and flu with more neutral and general words like individuals and disease, respectively. Phrased equivalently, we raised the abstraction level by moving from a specific case (flu at a boarding school) to a more general case (disease in a closed society). Very often, when developing mathematical models, we start with a specific example and see, through the modeling, that what is going on of essence in this example also will take place in many similar problem settings. We try to incorporate this generalization in the model so that the model has a much wider application area than what we aimed at in the beginning. This is the very power of mathematical modeling: by solving one specific case we have often developed more generic tools that can readily be applied to solve seemingly different problems. The next sections will give substance to this assertion."

365,389,0.355,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"increasing the productivity, profitability and sustainability of smallholder farming is critical for reducing poverty and improving food security and nutrition. Agriculture in SSA, however, is increasingly exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including market risk, production risks, climate variability, pest and disease outbreaks and windstorms, and institutional risks (Antonaci et al. 2012). The main premise is that by providing a steady and predictable source of income, cash transfer programmes can enhance household and community level resilience by improving human capital, facilitating changes in productive activities by relaxing liquidity constraints, improving natural resource management, and improving the ability to respond to and cope with exogenous shocks (e.g., Handa et al. 2015; Asfaw et al. 2012). The ultimate aim is to strengthen and improve resilience for rural producers to allow them to prevent future fluctuations in consumption and move to the next welfare level (Antonaci et al. 2012). Government strategies for managing agricultural risks at the household or community level have taken different forms in different countries, but are generally classified into three groups: 1. mitigation/adaptation activities designed to reduce the likelihood of an adverse event or reduce the severity of actual losses. Risk mitigation options are numerous and varied (e.g., irrigation, use of resistant seeds, improved early warning systems, and adoption of better agronomic practices); 2. risk transfer, such as commercial insurance and hedging; and 3. resilience-improving mechanisms to withstand and cope with events ex ante. Examples of these government strategies include social safety net programmes, buffer funds, savings, strategic reserves, contingent financing, insurance, etc. There are many definitions of resilience in the literature but the common thread in all definitions is the notion that resiliency reflects an ability to successfully manage or withstand a shock or stress (e.g., Alinovi et al. 2010). Unlike in other parts of the world, most farmers in SSA have no access to government or market-based risk management tools; when they do, government programmes or private sector initiatives to manage price and production instability are often insufficient. Moreover, social protection programmes are seldom institutionalized, and are rarely used as risk management instruments to address food and nutrition insecurity. However, an increasing number of African governments over the last 15 years have launched social protection programmes including cash transfers, workfare and public works programmes and in-kind safety nets. Cash transfer programmes in African countries have tended to be unconditional (where regular and predictable transfers of money are given directly to beneficiary households without conditions or labour requirements) rather than conditional (more common in Latin America and which require recipients to meet certain conditions, such as using basic health services or sending their children to school). Most of these programmes seek to reduce poverty and vulnerability by improving food consumption, nutritional and health status and school attendance. There is robust evidence from numerous countries (especially within Latin America and increasingly SSA) that cash transfers have leveraged sizeable gains in access to"

The interviews reveal that there is a consensus of âenvironmentalistâ language with regard to common issues. Corporate environmental responsibility, protection of and care for the environment, concern about water and energy consumption, and an orientation towards sustainable development are mentioned as necessary by all interviewees.32 But beyond the discursive rhetoric, deep code analysis reveals very different and even contradictory concepts about the following subjects: the environment, the responsibility of strategic actors for resources such as water and energy, the role of the government, and the waterenergy-mining complex, which ultimately reï¬ects different worldviews and epistemes about the relationship of man with nature. In general, we observe that these different discourses are set forth and projected at different scales (transnational, national and local) and levels (business, government and politics, and civil society), and that there is little room for dialogue. They maintain positions in the social structure of elites: the ï¬rst model is set forth mostly by CEO and high executives, and some senior government ofï¬cials; the second model is afï¬rmed by experts and also by senior ofï¬cials; the third model is set forth by politicians and experts (but is slightly more important among politicians); and the fourth model pertains to environmental leaders and some politicians. The consumption of water and energy in mining, seen in the light of the analysed discourses, is not an exclusively technical subject. The worldviews, linked to the social positions and interests of stakeholders, frame patterns of action and have an impact on the way in which the sustainable consumption of natural resources is represented.

87,60,0.355,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","The global rise of the concept of the bioeconomy has not been without its critics. One can distinguish two major types of criticism, which one can label the âfundamental critiqueâ and the âgreenwashing critiqueâ. An example of the fundamental critique is the writings by Birch and co-authors (Birch 2006; Birch et al. 2010). They criticize the bioeconomy as the âneoliberalization of natureâ. The authors analyse the emerging discourse of the knowledge-based bioeconomy in the EU and criticize that the development of the concept has been dominated by what they refer to as a âneoliberal ideologyâ. Accordingly, the criticism of the bioeconomy concept is linked to a more general critique of âa neoliberal regime in which market values are installed as the over-riding ethic in society and the market rule is imposed on all aspects of lifeâ (Birch 2006, p. 4). Related to this type of criticism is the claim that the concept has been promoted to pursue the interest of big companies, which are interested in commercializing innovations in the life sciences and in applying technologies that are contested in society, such as genetic engineering and synthetic biology. An example of this criticism is a paper by Gottwald and Budde that was published in 2015 on the occasion of the Global Bioeconomy Summit of 2015. These authors also argue that the bioeconomy would promote âland grabbingâ and threaten world food security (Gottwald and Budde 2015). The second type of criticism is not fundamentally opposed to the concept of the bioeconomy but rather warns against the use of this concept for âgreenwashingâ. An example of this type of criticism is a report by the World Wide Fund for Nature published in 2009 (WWF 2009), which is entitled âIndustrial biotechnologyâMore than green fuel in a dirty economy?â This report acknowledges the potential of the bioeconomy to make modern economic systems more environmentally sustainable, but points out that the approaches that have been promoted under the label bioeconomy do not necessarily realize"

This discomfort has generated active learning for us as researchers unfamiliar with the foundations of medical research, its dominance across health sciences and the quite similar metrics paradigm framing international development. Our concerns about the epistemological bias of these approaches and their inability to capture social context and process are well rehearsed in the book. But we have another concern about the efï¬cacy of evaluation. The Health Partnership Scheme in common with so many other funders of global health has begun to conceptualise every actor in a funded project as a researcher. On one level we commend that and it resonates with our ethical commitment to co-researching. The problem is that researching such complex interventions requires a very high degree of research expertise and is hugely timeconsuming. Partners in HP projects do not have the time or necessarily the expertise to undertake extensive literature reviews or policy analysis work; neither do they possess the skills to develop research plans and operationalise mixed-methods studies. And, they may well not have the experience, time or desire to engage in complex data analysis and writing up. Whilst all actors can become engaged in action-research projects and we have certainly viewed our Ugandan colleagues and professional volunteers as co-researchers, ï¬nally a considerable research expertise is required to design, manage and make sense of the data. On that basis we would question the pressure put on all projects to conduct in-depth, expensive and time-consuming evaluation. Certainly attempts to aggregate core indicators across the diversity of projects will achieve nothing apart from churning out meaningless and potentially misleading statistics. Recommendation 8: Evaluation Policy We would recommend that valuable resource expended on evaluation be used more wisely to conduct expert research on a sample of interventions managed by researchers with proven expertise. Many private consultancy organisations lack academic research training and experience and constitute an expensive and poor-quality âofferâ. The British Academy Report on the role of the Humanities and Social Sciences in Public Policy Making (Wilson 2008) expressed concern at the very high proportion of UK government departmentâs research budgets that were being âallocated to short-term projects to meet current political and administrative demandsâ arguing that the government was failing to leverage the academic research"

376,453,0.355,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The richly interconnected view of resource systems in an SES stands in opposition to strategies that attempt to reduce system complexity by focusing on only a small number of target resources, species, or indicators as is typical of maximum sustained yield and steady-state natural resource management (Holling and Meffe 1996). History has shown that these types of management strategies are often ecologically unsustainable because of unrecognized slow system change, sudden unpredicted disturbance, and/or unknown interconnections. On the social dimension, these approaches often fail as a result of an inability to understand what people want from natural resources, a lack of capacity to govern human resource use, and the broad perception of an accompanying policy or distribution of benefits as unjust. Given the evolving nature of complex adaptive systems and their lack of predictability, much of the work on SESs in rangelands and elsewhere focuses on developing responsive policy and governance that supports system resilience (e.g., Walker et al. 2004; Armitage et al. 2009) rather than attempting to provide specific and relatively inflexible resource management prescriptions. Social groups do not maintain consistent or uniform relationships with their surrounding environment, but change in either social or ecological patterns cannot necessarily be attributed to a corresponding driver in the other system (Vayda and McCay 1975). Resource management and governance policies must therefore monitor and be responsive to ecological and social processes that may or may not create new drivers of change within the SES. It is the inclusion of both ecological and social variables within the frame of analysis that makes the SES framework useful for management. Changes in the price of beef or altered land tenure policies, for example, have to be considered alongside fluctuations in climate and vegetation composition when planning management actions or policies for a rangeland SES. Problems that cross scales or levels within SESs can prove challenging for two reasons: perception and communication. First, the occurrence of a phenomenon at one level must be perceived as having been caused by a driver at another level. Second, that observation has to be communicatedâpersuasivelyâto the person or organization capable of solving the problem, and that person or entity has to decide to address the problem. Solutions involving changes in policy need to be effectively communicated to the affected population, ideally with buy-in from the affected populations. The perception problem can be met with a combination of thorough cross-scale monitoring and diverse information networks. Communication problems require adaptations to governance structures and strategies that facilitate information sharing and learning across sectors and hierarchical levels. An increasing number of groups, such as the Sustainable Rangelands Roundtable (http://www. sustainablerangelands.org/) and the California Rangeland Conservation Coalition (http://carangeland.org/) in the USA, are devoted to encouraging this type of communication about rangelands and range management. Inclusion of various stakeholders in goal-setting, planning, monitoring, research, data interpretation, and decision making is one way that managers can create"

284,65,0.355,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"awareness runs from the time of colonial exploitation through to today; â¢ the rejection by Latin American governments â since Stockholm in 1972 â of the idea of limits to growth, deï¬ning an agenda that proposed distinct âstyles of developmentâ but eventually accepting a confusing notion of âsustainable developmentâ; â¢ from the 1980s onwards, a growing number of socioenvironmental conï¬icts that gave way to âpopular environmentalismâ with networks of activists that denounce the extraction of natural resources and the destruction of the commons; â¢ the validity of ancient indigenous worldviews, the celebration of Pachamama that is recognized in the constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador, the respect for nature in Afro-American communities, and the contributions of liberation theology; also, on a cultural level, the presence of ecology in twentieth-century literature. There is clearly a Latin American conservationist environmentalism that is common with other continents: a shared admiration of European science (which is also American science) since Humboldt because of the enormous biodiversity of Latin Americaâs many diverse ecosystems, which were only partially explored. The extraordinary biological richness of not only the Amazonian rainforest but also of other ecosystems (such as the Atlantic forest in Brazil, mangroves and coral reefs, the Andean highlands, the tropical dry forests, the Pantanal, and other wetlands and marshes) are seen as a promise of the economic potential that is not yet conï¬rmed and, on the other hand, periodically leads to protests against âbiopiracyâ. Conï¬icts around the extraction and export of natural resources are increasing in Latin America. The resistance against the exploitation of nature has led to the growth of popular environmentalism, to environmental justice movements, to protests against climate injustice and water injustice, and to the defence of the commons. Latin American politicians and public administrators have basically ignored this movement of the environmentalism of the poor, but they have not suppressed it. Recently, however, there have been signs of an emerging postextractivist and post-developmentalist environmentalism that attack impartially both the neoliberal and the national-popular governments. Some would call it ecosocialism. This political environmentalism is very distinct from that of European green parties that focus on âecoefï¬ciencyâ. Post-extractivism is intellectually powerful but still politically"
341,318,0.354,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"An inclusive, systemic approach to freshwater governance begins by making the distinction between situation and system; no one governance situation is the same so contextual design and application are needed even if some of the principles and practices employed are held in common across contexts. When individuals, groups, organisations and governments engage with freshwater situations, almost overwhelmingly they bring their historical framing choices to the situation. Too often new terms are quickly adopted uncritically and used in ways that do not make clear the underlying conceptions held by different users of the language â in our research this applies to the concept âsocial ecological systemâ, âcomplex adaptive systemâ and the emerging discourse about natural capital, environmental assets or assetbased management (Coffey 2015). Language and concepts used unreflexively undermine inclusivity by capturing a particular framing at the expense of othersâ framings, or by undermining effective collaboration because people speak at crossed purposes. It is because of the importance of initial starting conditions in a given context, and the need to know what these are, as well as paying attention to what will help create an effective governance performance (Ison and Wallis 2011), that we have devoted considerable attention to framing issues and the role of language in this chapter. In achieving sustained systemic governance, these are important practical considerations, not unimportant theoretical musings! As we noted at the beginning when citing Lakoff (2010), all metaphors bring forth an associated system. In other words, language precedes system; in fact the choice to see a freshwater river as a system is a framing choice â the system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter and in our research, we hope to have presented a narrative that supports our normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance."
198,72,0.354,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"As argued in van den Berg (2013, p. 47), evaluations of climate change interventions, especially if they aim for a higher more comprehensive level of understanding what the interventions mean and what they achieve in the longer run, need to evaluate in the context of the continuing societal and economic winds that are causing climate change. Evaluators need to point out to policy makers and decision makers that what they promote with one hand, is more than sufficiently undone with a very active and much bigger other hand. If the forces of destruction can be reduced or even halted, climate change action will become successful. How successful can currently not be established fully for all actions â there is some international agreement on measurement of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but this agreement needs to be further developed. Many countries, multilateral and bilateral organizations are currently using various measurement systems at the same time in different projects â this needs to be improved. Evaluations, not just the seven comprehensive ones, but the many evaluations at the intervention level as well (many of which are highlighted in this book), provide an increasing body of knowledge that has been insufficiently explored for policy makers and decision makers on what works, where and when and for whom under what circumstances. This should focus on: â¢ How systems change can be effected through activities on key issues that will âtipâ or âtiltâ the system in the right direction; â¢ Identify the top-down actions that can and should be taken as they have proven to be effective; similarly look at bottom-up actions that can and should be supported; â¢ Present evidence on the difference in effectiveness between inclusive, gender sensitive, equity based approaches versus approaches that lack these perspectives; â¢ Contribute to a repository of evidence on which technologies under which circumstances, for whom, have proven to be effective in supporting more sustainable and low-carbon growth; â¢ Contribute to a repository of evidence on what works for whom, when, where, and under which circumstances on adaptation to climate change."
180,38,0.354,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Public health practice increasingly requires appreciation of the complementary roles facts and values play in making and justifying decisions. Observation reveals facts, while scientific research controls and manipulates the experimental context to discover causation or correlation. Data on disease burden, research on intervention effectiveness, and estimates of the resultant health benefits for the population generally inform public health interventions. Health messaging can often inform the public about the scientific rationale underlying public health interventions. Nevertheless, in the mind of the public, scientific evidence does not always invalidate or outweigh other sources of evidence or appeals to emotions, interests, and values. While public health practitioners give more weight to community health and scientific evidence, they also need to consider how the public will respond to an intervention. Successfully implementing public health actions, then, will often entail weighing the publicâs attitudes, interests, and values in relation to public healthâs core values. Two mundane features of public health practice often serve to conceal value assumptions: shared core values and standard practice. First, sharing values can render them invisible as assumptions, until they unexpectedly become contested. Unwelcome surprises occur when interventions that presuppose core values affect stakeholders who do not share those values, as when parents refuse to have children vaccinated based on media hearsay or individuals reject a highly effective program as governmental intrusion. Avoiding such surprises begins with becoming aware of oneâs own value presuppositions in relation to those of other stakeholders and community members. Second, routine use of evidence-based standards can conceal underlying value assumptions. If developed and tested to address a known health problem, as is common, an interventionâs purpose and effectiveness is taken for"
167,493,0.354,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"How can we use an intersectional approach to illuminate social, political, and environmental developments taking place in the Arctic? In my own work on the Arctic I use both a intersectional and a security analysis approach. Both concepts are actively present politically and socially across the region, and they are intimately tied to environmental use (or exploitation) and change. The term security invokes power, whereby the utmost priorities of the person, state, social group are linked to the survival of values and practices for the future (Hoogensen GjÃ¸rv 2017). Many are quite familiar with the narrower, militarized understanding of security that focuses on the use of the military for purposes of defending one actor, the state, from existential threat (Walt 1991). However, when we think in terms of actors more broadly, and diverse practices to ensure survivial (and the diverse ways in which survival is understood), a much more complex analysis results. Through intersectional analysis, it is possible to best understand the dynamics and tensions between priorities and perceived futures for the Arctic. This can be exemplified with the concept of âhuman securityâ which has been increasingly employed in Arctic research to articulate linkages between individual and community values and prerequisites for survival, and political and social policy. Human security was popularised in the 1994 United Nations Human Development Report, expanding the notion of security to include dimensions of food, health,"
341,290,0.354,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Performances and designs built on stationarity and fixed knowledge forms give rise to systematic (i.e. linear, step by step) practice rather than systemic practice that is relational, recursive and circular and characterised by feedback processes, learning and adaptation (Ison 2010). In other words, traditional framings used in water/ catchment governance are no longer adequate to our circumstances. As the commentators cited above argue, new understandings and practices (new paradigms) are needed. What a river/catchment is taken to be is undergoing a shift of historical proportions as exemplified in a move from the framings on which IWRM rests (see below) to the governance of a social-ecological system. The use of the concept ânexusâ is a further shift in framing choice exemplified by Campbell (2014) when he spoke about âconverging insecurities of food, water, energy and climate, and their implications for 21st Century farming systemsâ. In our Systemic Governance Research Program (SGRP) and CADWAGO research (see http://www.cadwago.net/), we are exploring the implications of framing governance in terms of the theory-informed practices (praxis) that can give rise to effective performances amongst multiple stakeholders in contexts of uncertainty and surprise (Ison and Wallis 2011; Ison et al. 2013b). A performance as in a good team, an orchestra, dance or play demands inclusion of the âright actorsâ."

246,6,0.353,Rewilding European Landscapes,"historical perspective on nature conservation. It discusses current policies with relevance for nature conservation in the EU, including the Nationally Designated Protected Areas, the Habitats and the Birds Directives, and the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy. The authors argue that wilderness protection has received little attention in Europe, although there are encouraging recent developments. The chapter discusses on how to build on those developments to widen the scope of policies targeted towards wilderness protection and rewilding. Finally, the authors argue that rewilding can play a major role in achieving some of the 2020 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the EU Biodiversity Strategy. We hope that this book inspires more research on rewilding and more practitioners to push the boundaries of conservation strategies. Nature is resilient but we need to learn how to better support that resilience. We conclude with a personal note on that resilience and on its limits. Henrique has been doing fieldwork in Peneda-GerÃªs National Park in Northern Portugal for over 25 years. Back in the early 1990âs this was an area where observing a wild boar or a roe deer was a rare event. A neighbor of Henriqueâs in Castro Laboreiro shared once that his grandmother, whom lived through most of the twentieth century, had never seen a wild boar. Now, things have changed. Today you can hardly spent more than a few weeks in the region without seeing a wild boar or a roe deer. A combination of farmland abandonment, reduced livestock grazing, and species protection with limited hunting was probably behind this wildlife comeback. Yet, there was a species that would not have come back by itself as it went locally extinct in the beginning of the twentieth century: the Iberian Ibex ( Capra pyrenaica). The species has been successfully reintroduced in the Spanish side of the GerÃªs mountain range in the 1990s and in the Spanish side of the Laboreiro mountains in the late 2000s. They now can be seen in both regions in the Peneda-GerÃªs National Park. And what an amazing sight it is to watch these agile animals climbing the large granite domes! We wish to dedicate this book to all the managers, scientists and last but not the least, the local communities, which made this wildlife return possible. Henrique M. Pereira Laetitia M. Navarro"
232,51,0.353,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"3 Loss, Damage and Victims The term âlossâ is used to designate the consequences of degradation. In some areas, these consequences can be anticipated, while in others they cannot. For example, in an armed conflict the intentional bombing of a military building can lead to its destruction. While this may have been the intention of those who undertook the action, it can also destroy buildings or injure people who were not the target. This is referred to as âcollateral damageâ.5 In this case âdamageâ is most meaningful when injury has been caused to a person or group, their property, or an environment (if there is an interest in claiming compensation). Losses can be immediate or longer term. When it concerns a person, group, non-human living species, or an environment the term âvictimâ must take on a broader meaning. Not only can it be used to designate people, but also living or non-living entities that have representatives who are able to speak on their behalf. For example, the quality of a coastline is said to be degraded following an oil spill and the media do not hesitate to describe the shoreline as a âvictimâ. Bees are another example. This living species is the victim of agricultural chemicals, or, as described in a French newspaper, the âvictim of the lack of biodiversityâ.6 Finally, before work-related accident legislation was implemented, there were no ofï¬cial victims of occupational accidents or illnesses. They could not be acknowledged until dangerous working conditions or hazardous machinery was recognised. Similarly, an analysis of breakdowns due to human factors can be seen as the clumsy (or even malicious) use of machines by operators. In general terms, there are no non-human victims. Instead, they are represented by individuals or groups who speak on their behalf and defend their interests before an authority that is responsible for estimating the loss they have suffered."
284,38,0.353,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction The debate on the socioenvironmental challenges faced by Latin America has a long history. This history is crucial to understanding Latin American perspectives on environmental governance and, above all, to understanding the speciï¬c characteristics which determine these perspectives. Traditional debates on environmental governance tend to see the Western debates on nature and environment as determining views and perspectives on a global scale. The suggestion is that Latin American environmental debates were directed by the changing views in the industrialized world. This chapter, however, suggests that Latin America has developed its own strands and perspectives on environmental issues which were emerging from its peculiar historical position. A focus on the speciï¬c, and to a large extent autonomous, knowledge development on nature and environment allow us to understand the determining roots of Latin American ideas on environmental governance. Latin American environmental ideas are closely connected to an environmental history since the Spanish Conquest, which was characterized by a dramatic drop in population and a series of export booms driven by one commodity after another. An early case in point may be the exportation of guano from Peru that amounted to about 11 million tons over 40 years, from 1840 to 1880, and was based on the exploitation of indentured Chinese workers (Gootenberg, 1993). In the last decades of the nineteenth century and in the beginning of the twentieth century, the entire Latin American region experienced a dramatic boom in agriculture for exportation. New crops such as coffee, cacao and banana, along with more traditional goods such as sugar, changed the economic and ecological context of much of Latin America as well as the lives of"
378,88,0.353,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"concepts in the second and third column of this table can best be understood by remembering that they were born in an era when â¢ the emphasis lay on the human intellect and its capacity to dissect complex processes and investigate them empirically; â¢ natural scientism and its law-like predictions of developments replaced religion as the prime source of explanations of the world; â¢ discourse around natural limits to population size met an energy revolution that fuelled the managerial-industrial drive to improve productivity; and â¢ the securing of private property and pursuit of self-interest became basic tenets of citizensâ freedom and were declared important drivers of progress. Modernity and neoclassical economic developments of the twentieth century have continued to employ the same mechanistic-additive view and basic concepts, pushing quantiï¬ed modeling and its extrapolating predictions into yet more dominance when computation made massive calculations possible. There is no emphasis on a deep or diversiï¬ed understanding of the ends that transactions should serve (human need satisfaction) or the scarce means that are required (natureâs resources). These are subsumed into the container terms âutilityâ and â(natural) capital.â This is in line with Robbinsâ deï¬nition and understandable when reflecting back on the context in which these concepts were born. Saturation with goods and services was reserved for a very small part of the population and poverty was widespread. It was rational to equate more with better. Meanwhile, in a world of one billion people with plenty of âundiscoveredâ territories, there was simply no expectation that more effective exploitation of nature would threaten its health and existence. From a transformation point of view it is thus easily understood why the Enlightenment movement claimed the term âliberalismâ: its ideas inspired collective action toward overcoming an old system that no longer delivered (as far as Enlightenment protagonists were concerned). The premise was to overcome the âdarkâ epoch of the Middle Ages. These ideas were key aspects of a paradigm shift that ï¬rst challenged the old order and its legitimizing narrative and later, as Polanyi showed, served as the gelling consensus between philosophers, scientists, businessmen, politicians and even church representatives working on alternative institution-building and rule-formulation. Polanyi also concluded that imagining all of society as one big market system and treating humans, nature, and money as ï¬ctitious commodities inevitably leads to sustainability problems. So here we come to an interesting question: if Robbins says that the application of economic concepts should be limited to situations of exchanges and choice making but Polanyi argues that all aspects of the planet have been subsumed under the imaginary and logic of a market system, where does the application of economics end? Having analyzed current discourse and observed the marketization and privatization trends of the last 30 years I would say that their application is almost ubiquitousâand that is precisely the problem. It means that neither ends nor means become the center of attention and investigation. Instead, it focuses only on the choice-making of selï¬shly calculating and insatiable individuals. The 250-year-old"
314,229,0.353,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Assessing the vulnerability of communities to climate shocks is important in identifying and characterizing actions toward strengthening resilience (Kelly and Adger 2000; Islam et al. 2014). Yet, existing literature suggests that individuals and communities that depend on highly climate-sensitive sector such as agriculture are vulnerable and less resilient to climate shocks. The existing literature is related to fishery systems (e.g., Islam et al. 2014), agricultural livelihoods (e.g., Brooks et al. 2005; Vincent 2007; Shewmake 2008; Deressa et al. 2008, 2009; Tesso et al. 2012; Etwire et al. 2013; Simane et al. 2016), and many sectors of the economy (e.g., Dixon et al. 2003; Dunford et al. 2015). However, to date none of them investigated quantitatively the extent to which land tenure affects vulnerability to climate shocks. Vulnerability of communities to climate shocks is the propensity or predisposition they are to be adversely affected (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1775). The three components of vulnerability are exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of the communities. Exposure has an external dimension, while sensitivity, and adaptive capacity have an internal dimension (FÃ¼ssel 2007). Exposure is the presence of communities in places and settings that could be adversely affected (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1765). Sensitivity refers to the degree to which communities are affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate shocks (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1772). As for adaptive capacity, it is the ability of communities to adjust to climate shocks, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1758). Adaptive capacity encompasses five types of capital: physical, financial, human, natural, and social capital (Scoones 1998). As mentioned above, resilience is becoming influential in development economics. Resilience is the capacity of communities to cope with climate shocks, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1772). Vulnerability and resilience are related concepts (Turner 2010). Resilience influences adaptive capacity (Klein et al. 2003; Adger 2006). Both vulnerability and resilience recognize adaptive capacity, so they"

If medical progress required experiments on animals, then the scientistâs cool indifference to vivisecting them signified dedication and self-mastery rather than callousness or cruelty. By the early-twentieth century, vivisection had come to be seen as an indispensable weapon in medicineâs unending âfightâ against disease: to be pro-vivisection was to be for science, progress, and the relief of human suffering, while anti-vivisectionists were enemies of science, whose sentimentality and squeamishness were obstacles to be overcome. To understand the motives of anti-vivisectionists, one must first appreciate the fundamental differences over the nature and goals of science that lay (and perhaps still lie) at the heart of the debate. I have laid particular emphasis on the thesis that vivisection was the expression of a particular view of scienceâobjective, dispassionate, materialisticâ which has now become so familiar it is largely taken for granted, but which was contentious in its time. Anti-vivisectionists also regarded themselves as scientificâthey tried to test their position through experiments such as anti-vivisection hospitalsâbut their idea of what constituted scientific sources extended beyond results acquired in the clinic and laboratory to encompass less palpable forms of knowledge. To them, a scientistâs duty was not simply to investigate physical phenomena but to seek a deeper appreciation of their significance and, by paying attention to ethical and social considerations, to increase the sum of human wellbeing. The spiritual revival, and ânew ageâ utopianism, deeply influenced the anti-vivisection movement. While the most important motives for early anti-vivisectionists were probably their commitment to Christian values and personal virtue, it is striking how many later ones were theosophists, vegetarians, pacifists, and members of various socio-religious orders, unions and groups. For these reformers, vivisection was unscientific because it treated animals as mere matter and ignored the spiritual, aesthetic and moral aspects of life that, though intangible, had to be heeded if humankindâs harmony with nature was to be restored. The idea that the vivisectionistsâ mask of objectivity hid their inability to understand the real consequences of their actions, or even accept"

The most important matters in the current global environmental governance are the items of how to invest human, material and financial resources under a certain kind of condition. Different countries in the world demand more and more interests of global environmental governance and the games become more and more complex, which conduct very slow progress of the global environmental governance. Environmental governance is a systematic project, which requires a large number of integrated and collaborative bodies to coordinate with each other. Every country should recognize the interests in the global environmental governance and enhance the awareness of participation in global environmental governance. They must establish a diversified investment mechanism from the organizations of government, enterprises and society and build up a mechanism of some parts of pollution control facilities operated by the market organizations. They should improve environmental protection system and perfect a unified, coordinated and efficient environmental regulatory regime. They should build up an announcement system of environmental quality and regularly publish in various regions of the indicators related to environmental protection, publish air quality, urban noise, drinking water quality, river water quality and other environmental information, timely release of information on pollution incidents. They should strengthen social supervision through hearings, feasibility studies or social publicity and other forms of public opinion. They should improve the environmental monitoring network, strengthen the environmental quality monitoring and increase the capacity of the pollution monitoring detection technology and routine testing equipment and the environmental emergency monitoring. Some countries should accelerate the construction of nuclear safety information system and implement information resources sharing mechanism. Using the coercive power of government, they should strengthen the environmental supervision, establish a government integrated decision-making mechanism for the ecological construction and environmental protection and improve a short, medium and long-term planning to the environmental protection."

183,35,0.353,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"1.6 Conclusion Social impact requires the successful implementation of a technology at a large scale. In this respect, developing a sustainable business model is crucial. De Jaeger et al. (2017) argue that the underlying challenge when it comes to ensuring a high impact depends on the development and successful implementation of a robust innovation/entrepreneurship ecosystem, the cooperation of all stakeholders, and sufficient resources. Innovation must also be linked to national and institutional systems, e.g., when developing medical technologies, the Ministry of health should be a key partner from the onset. The challenge consists in considering all of these factors simultaneously; by not doing so, the entire arch of technology development could run the risk of collapse due to a single factor (e.g., financial sustainability or socio-cultural acceptability) not being adequately addressed. It is for this reason that universities have a key role to play in supporting the path to innovation and entrepreneurship education, with outcomes that impact society at large. Human-centered design is the core of development engineering that aims to scale for impact by incorporating development goals, constraints, and opportunities (Levine et al. 2016). Development engineering is based on the belief that innovative technologies have the potential to improve life in low-income communities by incorporating insight from the social sciences throughout technological innovationâfrom prototyping to production at scale. 7 http://observers.france24.com/en/20161110-togolese-invent-3d-printer-waste."

Initially, valuable findings took the form of questions, rather than answers. 12. In order to bring more clarity by way of a culturally informed view of dementia, I took a positionâone also adopted by anthropologists Margaret Lock (1993, 2002) and Tsipy Ivry (2010)âthat understands knowledge about our bodies and minds as a product of history and culture. When addressing the mythologies of menopause in Japan and North America, Lock (1993, p. 370) pithily concluded that the condition âis neither fact nor universal event but an experience that we must interpret in contextâ. To quote Darin Weinberg (2005, p. 7), âsocial studies of science have shown time and again that scientific discoveries are temporally situated social constructions rather than revelations of a timeless and uniform natural orderâ. In this view, care practices stem from their âembeddednessâ in systems and ideas about health and illness, individuality and selfhood that exist in a âproductive networkâ that permeates the social body in its entirety (Foucault 1980, p. 243). 13. In the English-speaking world, the tale is primarily known for Robert Browningâs poem The Pied Piper of Hamelin (Curren et al. 1942). 14. Perhaps the greatest ironic juxtaposition, however, is that Hamelin is also home to Germanyâs largest juvenile detention centre, which lies less than 1 km south of the newly built village. Hamelinâs youth detention centre provides accommodation for young people between the ages of 14 and 24 who are remanded in custody or sentenced to a period of confinement, of which the average length is 1.7 years. Although it didnât open its doors until 1980, Hamelinâs prison history goes back a long way. It dates back to the Thirty Yearsâ War (1618â1648), after which Hamelin was converted into a large country fortress. As such, it served as a prison for the âdangerous subjects of the countryâ. Throughout the following centuries, new buildings were added and the prison was continuously expanded. During the Nazi dictatorship, it was used to detain political prisons, opponents of the regime and homosexuals (40 of whom were violently liquidated in April 1945). In the post-war years, the British government briefly used it as a detention centre for war criminals and added an execution site. Once returned to the federal state of Niedersachsen (in 1950), it was eventually converted into a juvenile detention centre. The 150-year-old prison, however, proved entirely unsuitable as a juvenile prison, which is why a new building was erected in the south of the city (Jugendanstalt Hameln 2015)."
180,452,0.352,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"As the Cold War abated, the global community adopted a more holistic approach to human rights, including the right to health. This was captured in the 1993 U.N. Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, a document that reaffirmed human rights as âuniversal, indivisible, and interdependent and interrelatedâ (U.N. 1993). The Vienna Declaration laid the foundation for the creation of the Office the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), an agency that oversees the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the U.N. system. Moreover, the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC),9 through its special procedures, appoints independent experts (or âspecial rapporteursâ)10 to report on areas of concern, including such health-related themes as food, physical and mental health, adequate housing and extreme poverty, and healthy and sustainable environments.11 As noted previously, this holistic approach was also reflected in the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (most of which are related to health) and exemplified in the coordinated approach to tackling HIV/AIDS. The health and human rights movement, which gained traction during the global discussion on sexual and reproductive health, firmly took root once health professionals responded to the peculiar challenges of treating HIV-positive people facing discrimination (Gruskin et al. 2007; Mann 1997). Quite apart from the scarcity of fiscal resources that often plague LMIC governments, other challenges preclude adopting an integrated approach to the right to health. For example, a long-standing argument is that the right to health as codified in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights attaches to individuals and is, hence, unsuited for effectively achieving public health objectives, goals that by definition focus on population health (Meier 2006). In addition, the proliferation of non-state actors in global health mentioned earlier (e.g., relief agencies, academic health partnerships, corporations, philanthropies) make coordination and accountability about the right to health more demanding. By and large, governments are the sole entities authorized to sign health-related human rights treaties such as the ICESCR. International treaties typically have mechanisms for ensuring that signatories fulfill legal commitments. But as discussed earlier, the diminishing role of governments in national policy and the increasing privatization of public services under globalization (WHO 2002) mean that treaty law will likely play a correspondingly smaller role in global health collaboration. Although the influx of new non-state actors allows stakeholders to partner in innovative ways to address challenges in global health, the stability and accountability of international human rights law remains a valuable asset in a constantly evolving field. Most cases in this chapter feature ethical issues that are illuminated but sometimes complicated by the human rights framework. In Jensen and Gaieâs case, human rights potentially impede a public health strategy for controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. The case calls for a public health official to balance the human rights"

198,489,0.352,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"14.5.3 Strengthening Human Behavior Elements of Participatory Action Research Participatory action research (PAR) is an approach to research in communities that strongly recognizes the importance of participation and action. It seeks to understand the world by trying to change it, collaboratively and following reflection. This approach appears consistent with research focusing on adaptation of agriculture to meet challenges posed by climate change and enhance food security. However, to increase the relevance of this approach specifically in the context of climate change, adjustment of action research aspects is required, including research designs, implementation of actions, data collection and analysis methods, reporting and learning. In the research designs it is essential to include both biophysical and behavioral components, and equal attention should be paid to activities that will influence biophysical and behavior components during implementation of the actions. The data used to evaluate success of adaptation research actions should also include biophysical and behavioral indicators, or parameters.

The Political and Economic Origins of our Times, Polanyi described what he saw as the complete overhaul of the core operating principles of societies, which took place when feudal agriculture was replaced by the capitalist industrialist market model. He used the term âGreat Transformationâ because it demarcated the change from one civilization to another through a process of continuous change of values, knowledge, norms, rules and regulations, starting in the late eighteenth century (Polanyi 1957: 3). His analysis focuses on Great Britain as the origin of industrialization. While applying a historical point of view, his work does not reconstruct a sequence of events in a perfectly chronological manner, but seeks to identify trends in the emergence of institutions and social technologies and to track which philosophical and economic ideas or reasoning lay behind them. To shed some light on these ties, Polanyi describes real world developments as well as core theoretical concepts and the explanations of influential thinkers of the time. This account therefore paints a picture of how creative and reflective actors provide ideas and explanations for real world developments and in so doing influence sociopolitical responses, sometimes very explicitly. His analysis shows how the basic ideas of what I will describe as the mainstream paradigm started emerging in the eighteenth century, and have since underpinned a massive reorganization of the social technologies and institutions guiding human development. To Polanyi, the most powerful of those ideas was the substitution of the economic motive of subsistence with that of gain. Polanyi discusses how the philosophers and scholars of that time were instrumental in presenting this perspective as a more accurate description of reality, one that was even natural or at least desirable. He singles out Adam Smith as particularly influential with his argument that it is a deeply natural human inclination to barter, trade and exchange in order to maximize gain. Smith also made self-interest the fundamental human drive behind the pursuit of those activities (Polanyi 1957: 68â70). Polanyi adds frequent references to other influential thinkers like Thomas Malthus, Jeremy Bentham, David Ricardo and Joseph Townsend, who nurtured the view that this inclination would need to be unleashed fully if man were to escape the fetters of poverty and starvation. Over time the new concept of âinterestsâ replaced what the"

For example, the negative outcomes of climate change and ozonelayer depletion will become more substantial for the next generations (Dentener et al. 2006), and the extinction of species as well as the decline of certain natural habitats including forests and oceans cannot be fully rectified in the future. In a similar vein, a deteriorating communal environment may hinder individuals from meeting their need for competence due to its impact on the next generationâs well-being. As an example, family disruption harms the well-being of children and grandchildren in impacted families (Amato 2005). To the degree that individuals ascribe such negative outcomes to their own or their societyâs failure to preserve natural and communal environments, their need for competence will be unsatisfied and their sensitivity to opportunities that maintain the environment will increase. Deteriorating natural and communal environments also negatively affect peopleâs need for relatedness (i.e., their need to connect with others) (Ryan and Deci 2000). First, declining environmental conditions that will primarily harm the subsequent generation are likely to make it more challenging for individuals to develop relationships with people in that generation. For instance, children may blame their parents (or the generation of their grandparents) for leading self-centered and egoistical lives that exploited and damaged nature and for causing problems that the children and their generation will have to endure. Second, a deteriorating natural environment generally causes unequal suffering among the earthâs population; often, the individuals who suffer most did not cause the decline, thus making it challenging for both groups of people to connect. Ozone-layer depletion, global warming, and overfishing, for instance, can largely be attributed to industrial activities and use in developed regions and countries, yet the numerous and often significant costs of these activities in the form of destroyed ecosystems are forced on developing countries (Srinivasan et al. 2008). In turn, individuals from these developing countries may reproach the developed countries for their self-centeredness and irresponsibility, thus harming interpersonal relationship building across different societies. Third, weakened communal environments can disturb salient social relationships, for example, between parents and their children when families are disrupted. With more struggles and relationship issues, peopleâs need for relatedness is unmet. In this case, they are likely to focus on"

The common ground for both above mentioned trendsâthe âdeprofessionalisationâ of science journalism and the âdeinstitutionalisationâ of science communication at largeâis the remarkable amount of laypersons finding their voices online and the self-conception of civil society organisations demanding to be involved in the science communication process. As much as this inevitably shatters the economic base of science journalism and as much as it may force the science establishment to reinvent its communication practice, we should be grateful for the degree of communication from âscientific citizensâ. Thereby the challenge lies less in permitting (or even embracing) bottomâup movements as such, but rather more in resisting the use of public dialogue as a means to an end. While valorising âcitizen scienceâ as an overdue âco-productionâ of authoritative social knowledge, Fuller warns us not to treat broadcasts of consensus conferences, citizen juries, etc. simply as better or worse amplifiers for the previously repressed forms of âlocal knowledgeâ represented by the citizens who are now allowed to share the spotlight with the scientists and policy makers. (2010, p. 292) The questionable success of most of these public engagement campaigns has increasingly been challenged recently. Grassroots initiatives like âWissenschaftsdebatteâ or âForschungswendeâ in Germany criticise openly the fact that pseudoengagement has merely served as a fig leaf excuse for the legitimisation of research agendas which are still being built topâdown. Instead it will be necessary to supplement the dragged-in rituals of âend of pipeâ dissemination with a fresh paradigm of âstart of pipeâ deliberation. Undoubtedly such initiatives cater to the transparency and true public engagement pursued by the ideal of Open Science. Thus within the âbig pictureâ we should embrace the opportunities of the OSC era, and in particular the interactive online technologies driving it."

For many asylum doctors, general paralysis was concerning not only in terms of the clinical challenges that it posed, but also due to the threat that the general paralytic patient was thought to pose to society more broadly. Nineteenth-century conceptions of diseases were explicitly related to the external environment, such as consumption as a result of poor sanitation. Connections like these served to tie the body to its immediate environment and lay the responsibility for disease at the feet of sufferers themselves.49 Softened, atrophied bodies that failed to behave in the usual way implied a failure to maintain oneâs own body, in contrast to the ideal of the controlled and self-regulated man. Roger Smith suggests that control of the body and its actions became linked to the state in this period: as the franchise was extended, it was expected that men would internalise the stateâs traditional values of law and order, producing an outlook and attitude that complemented the requirements of industrialisation.50 Unnatural local changes signalled a disharmonious body at odds with its environment and with the needs of industrial, capitalist societyâthis was clear in the inability of general paralytic patients to continue working in their normal occupations. The disordered male body was an anomaly, yet at the same time it was crucial to imagining order. It was an example that, in demonstrating the deviant body, painted a clearer picture than ever of the desired ideal.51 In addition, as a disease concentrated in towns and cities, general paralysis illustrated the apparently emasculating effects of urban life, raising the disturbing possibility that the converse of industrial progress was de-evolution and degeneration."

38,400,0.351,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"project(s) is an active area of exploration, especially for larger networks such as SciStarter (Azavea and SciStarter 2014) or iNaturalist. Recruitment is necessary so that citizens become aware of a projectâs existence. The starting point for recruitment is to determine who the target audience is (e.g., school children vs. bird watchers) and to then tailor the promotion and recruitment process towards this group (Tweddle et al. 2012). The creation of a safe and meaningful experience requires careful forethought about the nature of the participantâs experience, including where, what, when and how the data will be collected, any inherent risks that may arise and how to avoid, mitigate or manage those risks. This is especially important when participants may encounter challenging or hazardous conditions, such as observations which take place on or near waterbodies, from light aircraft, in remote or risky areas or involving dangerous or poisonous species. Addressing these considerations early on with careful planning and a response plan in case problems arise is essential to creating a sustainable CS program. Earthwatch has created templates for planning and managing risk on ï¬eld-based CS projects as part of a broader approach to developing ï¬eld-based CS projects (Earthwatch Institute 2013). For those individuals already engaged with these subjects, promotion and support via e-mail, newsletters, Facebook and Twitter may be sufï¬cient. Other actions might, however, be necessary to recruit new participants, such as through the use of the national, local or regional press or utilizing different types of media (e.g., TV, radio, print, online) and specialist publications. Holding a launch event, or an event at an existing festival or fair, can provide valuable face-to-face contact that will inform potential volunteers about the aims of the project, why their help is important and what they will gain from the project. These types of events also allow citizens to interact directly with the scientists involved and establish close relationships. Word-of-mouth recruitment by existing participants is one of the most powerful means of growing the base of volunteers for a program (Prestopnik and Crowston 2012a, b; Tweddle et al. 2012). With respect to volunteer motivation, there are many studies (Bramston et al. 2011; Bruyere and Rappe 2007; Buesching et al. 2015; Raddick et al. 2013; Silvertown et al. 2013; Van den Berg et al. 2009) that have examined this aspect of CS projects. Understanding motivation is a critical prerequisite to developing successful CS projects. For example, Van den Berg et al. (2009) surveyed volunteers enrolled in a conservation program, and revealed a number of motivations including: the desire to learn more about the science behind the project; enjoyment of the outdoors; the feeling that they are helping the environment; getting to know other people with similar interests and as a way to make new friends; and having fun. The main motivation found by Raddick et al. (2013) in participating in the Galaxy Zoo CS project was the desire to contribute to science while other motivators included interest in the scientiï¬c subject and the possibility of making new scientiï¬c discoveries. Although this list of motivations is far from exhaustive, it highlights the need to recognise that individuals are motivated by a number of different drivers and that these may differ across communities and across different demographic groups. Some communities may feel excluded and identifying the"
247,249,0.351,Humanities World Report 2015,"addressing profound current societal challenges and applauds the mainstreaming of the humanities across all six priorities of Horizon 2020: European Social Sciences and Humanities are world class, especially considering their diversity. They are indispensable in generating knowledge about the dynamic changes in human values, identities and citizenship that transform our societies. They are engaged in research, design and transfer of practical solutions for a better and sustainable functioning of democracy. Their integration into Horizon 2020 offers a unique opportunity to broaden our understanding of innovation, realigning science with ongoing changes in the ways in which society operates. Furthermore, the Vilnius declaration supports assessment of impact as one of the basic quality criteria of good science, although it is not made perfectly clear whether such assessment is to be one of the criteria for the allocation of research resources, or if it is a post festum measure to find out if research results are disseminated and implemented.44 So, looking at policy developments in the EU and comparing them to the US, we might find some cause for optimism, even a model for other regions to follow. But, as we saw above, these same developments have their critics. As the authors of this report, where do we stand? The more positive view â in favour of greater engagement between humanists and policy makers â fits well with some of our findings in Chapter 2, where over half of our interviewees identified âsocial valueâ as the most important extrinsic justification for the humanities, defined as a broad concept ranging from moral values to informing social decisionmaking and contributing to or contesting social cohesion. Another very frequently stressed value was âcultural heritageâ, implying the preservation and critical evaluation of material as well as immaterial leftovers of the past. We also saw in Chapter 3 that much humanities research genuinely engages with the social in terms of the themes selected for study. But there are at least two problems with which we should close. First, in this chapter we have also seen that some policy makers take a much narrower view of the contribution (if any) that the humanities have to make, particularly in promoting economic growth and innovation. The problem is that, as we saw in cChapter 2, our interviewees rarely identified such values and showed very little appetite for seeing them as a goal for humanities research. So, whenever the more narrow-minded policy makers have the upper hand, there will be a serious rift with the humanists. Second, even when policy makers take the broader view and stress"

10,86,0.351,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Over the last two decades EU Drought Policy has developed from a series of scattered policies that range from broader forms of water governance that tackle water issues to more recently, direct policy actions to adapt and mitigate drought occurrences. In either case, the effectiveness of drought-related policy frameworks largely depend on the mobilization and operationalization of the policy through national and regional drought policies and initiatives (Bressers et al. 2013). Moving forward, there is a critical need to shift from a crisis-oriented management approach to a risk-based (or even resilience-based) management approach. In addition, further integration and strengthening of various policy instruments, as suggested by the Blueprint for Safeguarding, that aim to promote policy measures, such as water efï¬ciency, across water, land, and nature, and other management and policy spaces, are necessary to begin catalyzing such a shift. More support, in the form of ï¬nancial mechanisms, at all policy levels is also essential, particularly within more complex policy mixes such as the WFD and the CAP. At the moment, the only policy instrument directly tackling drought that exists at the European level is the Europeans Commissionâs Communication on water scarcity and drought. However, due to its lesser status in relation to Directives, the Communication is still weak and lacks teeth in the policy landscape. Somehow coupling WS&D with the"

In part, the conservation value of the phylogenetic approach is in its ability to guide pre-emptive actions towards identifying and prioritizing the most at-risk species. For example, by identifying species with traits or in regions that predispose them to high risk of extinction, we can identify species that are not yet at risk of extinction but which might become threatened in the near future if current extinction drivers increase in intensity or geographic extent. Cardillo et al. (2006) referred to such species as having high âlatent riskâ of extinction. Given limited conservation funding, focusing efforts on species with high latent risk might make economic sense as it is likely to be more"
365,537,0.351,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Resilience has been defined in a number of ways in the scientific literature. In ecology, resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to maintain its form and function in response to a shock or disruption (Folke 2006; Nelson et al. 2007). In economic terms, resilience can be defined as the capacity to restore or maintain economic values, such as farm income (Antle et al. 2006; Antle and Capalbo 2010), or to minimize the loss from an adverse disruption or âdisasterâ over the time it takes for a system to return to its ânormalâ state (Hallegate 2014). Resilience to climate change can also be defined more broadly as the capacity to cope with change and minimize losses from change and enhance possible benefits of change, and thus can incorporate longer-term responses through adaptation (Malone 2009). The definition of resilience as the capacity to withstand disruptions refers to the properties of a given systemâs performance, and is most relevant to analysis of relatively short-term events such as a storm or drought where it can be expected that the system will return to its normal state. In contrast, the capability to adapt or respond by making purposeful changes in a system seems most relevant to longer-term permanent changes in climate, and can include adaptations that are designed to improve the capability to withstand shocks or disruptions. Clearly, both concepts of resilience â the ability to minimize the effects of temporary shocks and disruptions, as well as the capacity to cope with the long-term shifts in weather patterns associated with climate change â are relevant to analysis of agricultural system performance. The AgMIP RIA framework illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 can be used to quantify resilience using the various indicators identified above. As noted above, vulnerability is measured as the proportion of farm households that experience a loss over a specified period of time. Loss can be measured in economic terms as reduced income or loss of the capitalized value of income plus assets, and also in noneconomic terms such as reduced health or degraded environmental conditions. To see how resilience can be quantified, define the minimum possible loss for a given system as Lossmin and define the realized loss as Loss. This minimum loss can be measured in various ways depending on the context. For example, it could be the loss that would be incurred if the best coping actions are undertaken as soon as possible and as effectively as possible. A resilience indicator can be calculated as 100 (Lossmin / Loss), similar to what Hallegate (2014) defines as âmicroeconomic resilienceâ. Thus, if a system can achieve the minimum possible loss its resilience is 100%, and otherwise its resilience is less than 100%. This measure of resilience fits the situation where there is a loss, whereas with climate change and other types of change there can be net aggregate gains in some cases, and even when there are losers, there are also likely to be some gainers. To accommodate both gains and losses, we adopt the convention that resilience is 100% for gainers. Letting v be the percent of vulnerable population, the resilience indicator for the population of gainers and losers is then calculated as 100 (1 â v) + v Lossmin / Loss."

What exactly is the role and importance of spatial representations for the construction of sociocultural realities in the past, present and future? How does the digital revolution change the historically established societyâspace relations? What are the spatial implications for the formation of knowledge? Is the term environment an abstract category, a social macrophenomenon, a local cluster of individual factors of influence, or a localized culture? How can one measure an environmentâs impact on action and knowledge production (Meusburger, 2015a)? These and other questions indicate that relations between knowledge, action, and space are not as simple as some people might assume or as some decision and risk models or traditional rational choice theories suggest. The questions simultaneously underscore the urgent need to explore the interdependencies of knowledge, action, and space from different disciplinary angles, scales of analysis,3 time dimensions,4 and ontologies. The main ambition of this book is to contribute to the clarification of the linkages between knowledge, action and space beyond the well-established models. To redeem this claim it is first necessary to overcome the problematic legacy of homo oeconomicus and traditional rational choice theories and discuss some of the reasons why the spatial dimension was neglected or played only a marginal role in action-centered social theories. If we want to deepen the insights into the relations between action, knowledge and space, then the spatial dimension needs as much theoretical inquiry as the relations between knowledge and action (see the chapters by Werlen (Chap. 2), Ernste (Chap. 3), Olsson (Chap. 4), GardenfÃ¶rs (Chap. 12), and Berthoin Antal and Friedman (Chap. 13) in this volume)."

This contrasts with visions of Western states and UN agencies as endowed with the means and resources for assessing the situation and best planning any intervention. In this vision, they are courageous and generous agents ready to self-sacrifice, have great care for human lives, and have the capacity to act (AJ 1-3; TG 1-2). When the international community fails to comply with these standards publicly, its accountability is established through different techniques. First, other responsibilities are identified and often these are not elements within the control of the so-called international community: for example, the weather or the bureaucratic system is seen as hampering rescue efforts in the Mediterranean (TG 2-4). Also, the irrationality of other actors can be used to explain the international communityâs failures: sub-Saharans in desperate situations would be inclined to not exercise clear judgement and to put their lives at risk, as when, trying to capture the attention of a rescue boat, they move to one side of their ship, causing it to capsize (TG 2). Moreover, NATO and EU states are pictured as self-reflexive and prone to take actions that will improve their tactics and strategies of intervention, for instance improving coordination efforts for evacuations and lifesaving missions at sea (NYT 5-7; TG 78:). Finally, media and other actors take the role of powerful watchdog, engaged to show the international community unforeseen problems and to envision possible solutions, as in the case of unanticipated migratory movements towards Europe or racist attacks on black Libyans and migrants in Libya (AJ 2-35-6; NYT 5; TG 5-7-10). In this case, in addition to migrantsâ testimonies employed to confirm the information presented, many references to Western values of liberal democracy serve as guidelines for actions, completely legitimizing the actual organization of the world order and failing to address existing inequalities and imbalances (AJ 2-6-9; NYT 5; TG 7). In a nutshell, media represented the Libyan conflict as a step in the countryâs process towards Western ideals and modernity; they show its migration crises as the result of irrational, cruel, and short-sighted policies by Gaddafi, and this implies that support for the management of migratory movements by Western interventions was necessary to achieve security, freedom, and the democratic principles of the international order. Direct and subtle associations in the articles analysed indicate strongly that media conveyed suggestions that reinforced mainstream international models while play-acting mobilizations for migrantsâ"

182,37,0.35,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"from interwar Britain and its empire, to the post-war international stage, it explores how developments in nutritional science and veterinary medicine, combined with economic depression, food shortages and the effects of war, drew attention to the undernourished, unhealthy bodies of both humans and cows, and suggested connections between them. By the early 1950s, under the United Nations and its agencies, cows had become key participants in the campaign against human hunger in the developing world. Their unproductive bodies inspired the formation of new health structures that brought together experts in human health, nutrition, veterinary medicine and agricultural science to create new types of cow that would prove more capable of supporting human health and nutrition. Chapter 5 continues to cross borders between nations and disciplines in its study of the tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus, and the ideas and investigations it inspired. It is particularly concerned with the work of parasitologist Calvin Schwabe, who is better known as a progenitor of the recent movement for OH. for Schwabe, Echinococcus was an animal in its own right, an active, opportunistic participant in both human and non-human ecological and cultural interactions. In following Schwabe as he followed Echinococcus, from the laboratory into human communities and multispecies ecosystems, and from Beirut to Kenya to California, this chapter reveals that the roots of his commitment to unifying human and veterinary medicine lay in his deep-seated engagement with the parasite. His investigations into its body and behaviour led him to view distinctions between human and non-human species as culturally contingent rather than fundamentally biological. This fed his conviction that human and veterinary medicine could only function truly effectively when practised in tandem. Chapter 6 takes forward the story of OH by exploring its emergence as a self-conscious movement, dedicated to the integrated study of problems at the interface between human health, animal health and the environment. It explores how Schwabeâs work influenced, and was reconfigured by, this movement, and locates its early development in several research and policy networks, which produced not one but several different forms of OH. The chapter also examines how humanâ animal health relationships have inspired and shaped OH, and how they are representedâin sometimes contradictory waysâin the texts and images produced by its researchers and advocates. It argues that in privileging the roles of animals as transmitters of diseases to humans, and"

In sum, six mainstreaming strategies operate at the three levels (local, institutional and interinstitutional).7 They are illustrated in Fig. 15.1 and Boxes 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4. The first two (Strategies IâII) focus on the local or household level and relate to the way the four risk-reducing approaches (outlined above) are included in on-theground initiatives (either integrated or added on). Three strategies focus on the institutional level and address issues of internal organization (Strategy III) and cooperation (Strategy IV), together with policies and regulations (Strategy V). For example, it is crucial to ensure that organizational procedures and routines foster, rather than hamper (cf. Uittenbroek 2016), the implementation of nature-based solutions. The sixth strategy (Strategy VI) focuses on the interinstitutional level, external cooperation with other organizations (local, regional, national and international) and citizens. It addresses sector work, professional training and society in general. At the institutional and interinstitutional level, mainstreaming involves both targeted and implicit integration. At the institutional level, municipalitiesâ mainstreaming strategies can include the development of standalone adaptation strategies, the creation of interdepartmental working groups for climate change adaptation, and the integration of adaptation objectives into sectoral policies and instruments (e.g. green structure plans), comprehensive or detailed planning (cf. Wamsler 2015a; cf., Boxes 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4). Strategies addressing the interinstitutional level can include municipal participation in regional innovation platforms that aim to create new business and cooperation models for financing nature-based solutions for climate adaptation, or the creation of city-citizen collaboration (cf. Wamsler 2015a). Unlike other mainstreaming frameworks that address targeted and implicit integration separately (cf. Uittenbroek 2016), the framework that is presented here includes both since related actions and processes are fluent and mutually supportive. Politics and power must be explicitly addressed at all three mainstreaming levels, as they are a potential root cause of risk and represent avenues (or barriers) to transformation (cf., Boxes 15.1 and 15.4). The analysis of power (relations) is thus a precondition to sustainable change and to understand how transformation can be achieved or be hindered (Daly 2005; Digeser 1992; Partzsch 2015). This should include an evaluation of shared power (power with, cooperation and learning), the exercise of power (power to, resistance and empowerment) and power over others (coercion and manipulation) in potential mainstreaming approaches and strategies (cf. Allen 1998; Verloo 2005). Issues related to power need to be fundamentally challenged whenever and wherever modernity and globalization lead societies down an unsustainable road (Manuel-Navarrete 2010)."

Thereby journalism neither succeeds in depicting the âbig science pictureâ of policy, ethics, and economics holistically, nor the real complexity of a knowledge-creation process authentically, which is everything but linear, being a process in which knowledge is permanently being contradicted or falsified, and is therefore never final. However, the notion of what the essence of science really is could perfectly well be vulgarised through web technologies, in the sense of making the different steps within this process of knowledge-creation transparent, for instance by means of a continuous blog or other messaging or sharing platforms. Yet there are still only very few examples for such formats (see below), and they are particularly sparse in journalism. The tendency to reduce science to supposed success stories is certainly also a result of its mediatisation, i.e. science and science policies reacting and adapting to the mass media logic by which it is increasingly being shaped and framed (Krotz 2007; Fuller 2010; Weingart 2001). This brings us to the second dimension of science communication."
77,25,0.35,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"State of the Field and Contributions of the Volume The intersection of social epidemiology and the life course perspective is fairly recent. This volume shows that the field is expanding, with groups developing in different contexts. Infrastructure and resources required for this effort are also extending. These will help to further establish life course research groups, such as the International Centre For Life Course Studies In Society and Health at University College London, the University of Antwerpâs Centre for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies (CELLO), and the National Center for Competence in Research LIVES â Overcoming vulnerability over the life course â at the Universities of Lausanne and Geneva. Developments will also be strengthened through the funding of biomedical data collection as part of large-scale social surveys and the promotion of open academic access to these publically funded data. On the academic side, progressive institutionalisation can be observed with the establishment of learned societies, the organization of scientific conferences, workshops and summer schools. Further efforts should focus on comparisons between countries and international projects. Challenges exist in regard to the integration of interdisciplinary theoretical models and sophisticated statistical analyses, which requires collaborative interdisciplinary work, allowing a mix of skills to pursue the ambitions of life course epidemiology. This volume brings together nine contributions selected upon propositions received after a wide distribution of the call for papers at the international level. The authors of these contributions represent a range of disciplines and countries, including Switzerland, United States of America, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and United Kingdom. The chapters combine a mix of reviews, empirical analyses and methodological contributions. They address a range of health topics including obesity, oral health, coronary heart disease, mammogram screening, and cystic fibrosis and take into account different life stages, from childhood to late life. In the absence of clear criteria to structure the presentation of the contributions, we opted for a ârandomâ order for the first six chapters. The last three contributions have a common focus on methodological and statistical aspects. The first chapter, Trajectories and transitions in childhood and adolescent obesity by Laura Howe, Riz Firestone, Kate Tilling and Debbie Lawlor, offers a review of the evidence regarding trajectories and transitions in childhood and adolescent obesity. The rising prevalence of obesity has turned it into a major public health preoccupation, despite some variations across high-income countries. The chapter shows how adopting a life course perspective improves our understanding of long term consequences of overweight and obesity in early life. Longitudinal"
10,394,0.35,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"12.6.2 Cognitions Cognitions refers to the observations of reality, the frames of reference, and the interpretations of the actors at hand. While motivations among actors tend to differ widely, all actors across case studies tend to share similar cognitions based on observed changes in the regional water balance. There are general observations among nature conservation actors that precipitation regimes are changing in unexpected ways and that these regime changes influence both flora and fauna habitats. In recent years, a large number of creeks have gone dry, leaving behind almost non-existent vegetation. Damages from droughts are increasingly affecting agricultural yields in rural areas, while cities and their urban infrastructure are also more and more at risk as a result of lower reservoirs. The visibility of drought has increased in recent years, both in the farming and urban contexts as well, which in turn has contributed to widespread cognitive shifts among all nature conservation-related actors. More and more, stakeholders coherently and consistently agree that water scarcity and drought is, and will increasingly become, a problem. In response, strategies to combat drought impacts have already been developed into guidelines that keep water longer in the ground and in surface waters, employ water use efï¬ciency schemes, and develop medium- and long-term possibilities for extra water transport. These strategies further contribute towards a more uniï¬ed cognitions in nature arenas. As a result, it is expected that coherence among stakeholders will increase moving forward, with more experience with drought and water scarcity likely to develop into the future. Nature-related regulations, including the WFD and the Habitats and Birds Directives, in addition to creating driving pressures, also contribute to shifting cognitions among relevant actors as drought protection measures become more ubiquitous. More broadly, there is general cognition and awareness regarding the need for collaboration across a wide range of actors, including both public and private, at all levels. Because water scarcity and drought can impact both land, marine and freshwater ecosystems, connectivity is key to addressing the crises. Such a cognitive approach is particularly important in moving away from strictly legal incentives as the main motivators. In an effort to place less reliance on legal incentives, improving communication between actors and providing the tools and space for negotiating the relationship is the key. This approach allows for competing motivations to ï¬nd more harmonious solutions before resorting to a priori legal recommendations."
320,315,0.35,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"10.6.5 Working Step: Stakeholder Involvement, Communication and Participation Many conflicts in protected areas are caused by land-users and other stakeholders not accepting the objectives and measures of nature conservation because they stand contrary to their interests. It is essential to include and integrate those stakeholders and land users in the process of adaptation. This is vital for the increase of acceptance and to find win-win-solutions that help all parties involved to adapt to climate change. To foster stakeholder involvement existing conflicts and problems with land-users and stakeholders have to be analysed and documented, and suitable strategies for participation and communication must be identified. Furthermore, land-users and other stakeholders will also have to adapt to climate change (for example, artificial irrigation to avoid drought, or snow cannons to extend tourist seasons). Such autonomous adaptation activities might not even be directly attributed to climate change. However, they can be in conflict with protection efforts, increase existing problems or even create new threats to conservation goals. Hence, the autonomous adaptation of stakeholders should be monitored and guided by conservation management. Successful adaptation to climate change requires the close cooperation of diverse stakeholders, land-users, administrators, and scientists. Each of the"

However, once the goal of energy saving was clearly presented, an innovation occurred, and the coefficient of performance started to increase. If you follow an air conditioner which was awarded the Energy Conservation Grand Prize, you will find that it evolved as expected according to the technological prediction we made. In other words, imposing strict regulations in an area which has a large room for innovation facilitates technological innovation. The third conclusion is that a technological prediction is also important in making a policy in light of the economic impact of environmental regulations. Currently, it is hard to say that technological prediction is fully reflected in developing environmental regulations. Consequently, the process winds up in exchanges of unwarranted assertions among the industry, policy makers, and environmentalists. As far as technological prediction is concerned, no reliable answers can be obtained from companies if you ask them about it. Scholars and engineers have to assemble and logically thrash it out. Such patient and solid discussions have hardly been made. It is thus an important point how to reflect a technological prediction in environmental policymaking and economic forecasting."

The efforts of this commission producing standards for IT-based maps are also relevant for topical maps on risk distribution. The joint-research programs that IUGS runs in co-operation with UNESCO and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) have distinct foci and a long history in addressing problems of risk and hazard. With UNESCO, the IUGS has run for over 45 years the International Geoscience Program (IGCP) and with IUGG the International Lithosphere Program (ILP). One of IGCP science themes is: âGeohazards: mitigating the risksâ. A selection of recent and active projects under this umbrella is listed below. These encompass historical as well as health aspects such as: earthquake archaeology; medical geology; the environmental and health impacts of major and abandoned mines in Sub-Saharan Africa; impacts of mining on the environment in Africa; preparing for coastal change; seismo-tectonics and seismic hazard in Africa; the signiï¬cance of modern and ancient submarine slopes and landslides; and deformation and ï¬ssuring caused by exploitation of subsurface fluids.

A common-heard refrain is, âIf impacts are uncertain, then nothing should be done.â Generically, this use of uncertainty to position stakeholders needs to be understood by climate scientists and climate-science interpreters. The argument is often made that the reduction of uncertainty is needed to overcome barriers to action. However, there is little evidence that reducing uncertainty yields better policy outcomes or decisions.13 Climate science and climate modeling is a science of increasing complexity, and reduction of uncertainty in a quantitative sense is unlikely. The reduction in uncertainty comes from adding more complexity and gaining more certainty about the answer, but not necessarily by reducing quantitative uncertainty: It is increasing conï¬dence in the answer and conï¬dence in the number of different types of uncertainty that can be addressed. Furthermore, given the role of uncertainty to bolster stakeholder positions, uncertainty can always be used to breed doubt. Therefore, it is a fallacy to maintain that reduction of uncertainty is the key to improving usability of climate projections. Fortunately, the successful use of climate projections in planning often does not require the strict quantiï¬cation of uncertainty. Practically, complex speciï¬cations of uncertainty add another level of expertise that must be interpreted, and the incremental changes to already highly uncertain parameters are not of sufï¬cient value to justify the cost of the additional expertise. Complex speciï¬cations may make it harder to interpret climate projections by a broad community of users.14 Though some practitioners desire quantitative measures of uncertainty, for many people âuncertainty narrativesâ are all that is required to justify incorporation of climate change into planning and management. Uncertainty narratives can be framed in different ways for different problems. One productive way is to frame the uncertainty in the context of known vulnerabilities to weather. If there is an already-observed climate trend of important weather events (for example, extreme precipitation), and if that trend is consistent with model projections, then uncertainty can be discussed in relation to known weather vulnerabilities. This brings attention to the climate modelâs ability to represent weather features. For example, if a climate model does not represent the spatial and temporal organization of severe thunderstorms generating large amounts of rain in the central United States during summer, then it is difï¬cult to substantiate uncertainty descriptions in regard to changes in this phenomenon. In the case of severe thunderstorms, most climate models are missing a key process (hail formation) at a subgrid scale they cannot represent. It is also true, in many applications, that the availability of water is dominated more by policy and built infrastructure than by precipitation: âwater flows uphill towards moneyâ15.

The Sendai Partnerships will help to provide practical solutions and tools, education and capacity building, and communication and public outreach to reduce landslides risks. As such, they will contribute to the implementation of the goals and targets of the Sendai Framework, particularly on understanding disaster risks including vulnerability and exposure to integrated landslide-tsunami risk. The work done by the Sendai Partnerships can be of value to many stakeholders including civil protection, planning, development and transportation authorities, utility managers, agricultural and forest agencies, and the scientiï¬c community. UNISDR fully support the work of the Sendai Partnerships and the community of practice on landslides risks, and welcomes the 4th World Landslide Forum to be held in 2017 in Slovenia, which aims to strengthen intergovernmental networks and the international programme on landslides."

222,293,0.349,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Environmental Management After decades of reasonably stable forest cover, the mangrove forest in the case area has suffered a small degree of encroachment. With reduced levels of water flow and increasing use of agricultural fertilisers across the country, for example, water quality has deteriorated to a certain extent, with governance capacity having improved to some degree but not sufficiently to control diffuse pollution. Improvements to reticulated water supplies have not been quite adequate to compensate for this, and consequently levels of water-borne diseases have risen slightly. Protection of biodiversity has been detrimentally affected by a government focus on economic development, though efforts by civil society groups to remedy this have been stepped up. Coastal fisheries have dwindled due to the use of illegal and destructive gear, defiance of the ban period by the fishers and catching of undersized fish. Despite this, over-fishing continues as enforcement is weak."

Examples include spreadsheets that try to predict budgets of money or goods. Some of these models are numerical. Climate models are usually not statistical but contain some processes represented with observed climate statistics, and equations built from physical theory. Essentially, a climate model is a giant representation of the âbudgetâ of mass (of water, of carbon) and of energy in the climate system. A climate model is an attempt at representing the critical budgets and flows in the climate system in a way that they obey the basic laws of physics we observe all around us."
255,191,0.349,Railway Ecology,"Here we provide a case study on bird collisions in a railway that crosses a wetland of international importance, the Sado Estuary (Portugal), which is a RAMSAR site and a Special Protection Area for birds classiï¬ed under the European Union Directive 79/409/EEC. Especially from autumn to mid-spring, this wetland is home to thousands of waders, wildfowl, flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus, and other aquatic birds, which use a diversity of wet habitats including open water, mud flats, rice ï¬elds, and salt pans (LourenÃ§o et al. 2009; Alves et al. 2011). These birds were expected to cross the railway area on a daily basis, particularly the bridge crossing the Sado River, due to movements from roosts to feeding areas, and among feeding areas (e.g., Dias et al. 2006). Therefore, it was feared that they were exposed to a high risk of collision, with the possibility of mass mortality events occurring due to the collision of large flocks with bridge structures and circulating trains. Our study was designed to clarify this issue, aiming at: (1) quantifying bird mortality patterns due to collisions associated with the presence of the railway; (2) characterizing the movements of wetland birds crossing the railway bridge along the circadian and the annual cycles; and (3) estimating the seriousness of the risk of wetland bird mortality associated with this railway, as well as which bird species are most at risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ï¬rst published study documenting the impacts of railways on wetland bird mortality."

Foreign capital and expertise is not in itself bad, but it is vital to ensure that foreign-led and financed economic activities in the Arctic serve the needs of Arctic peoples as well in order to prevent becoming caught up in neocolonial processes. From mining companies and fishing interests to government authorities based in distant seats of power, we must seek to simultaneously be open to the world and avoid becoming a passive cog in the great machine of global capital and realpolitik. The globalisation of corporate power is accompanied by a globalisation of risk and of concern for Indigenous peoples and the future of the Arctic.

155,329,0.349,New Vision 2050 : a Platinum Society,"Uchiyamada The discussions took place mainly in the Environmental Affairs Division. At the core of our vision was the desire to bring good products out into the world, create even better cars, and bring smiles to the faces of our customers. Based on this, we boosted our management foundations and create new products. Itâs an old turn of phrase, but one of the Five Main Principles of Toyoda called for contributing to the common good. It means being of use to the world through the medium of the automobile industry. This way of thinking is deeply imbued in our workforce. We donât think we are making cars for profits, but rather we want to be of use to the common good by making cars. Around the time we joined the company, the important thing was developing and deliver cars that were highly reliable and offered good cost performance so that everyone could drive a car, and through that make life more convenient. After that, we worked on building the Prius and making fuel-cell powered vehicles in our effort to be of use to everyone through cars that offer excellent environmental performance. At that point, when we thought about what idea should be our next focal point, the one that we of course felt really struck home was the impact of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report on the need to reduce to zero or even shift into the negative range greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the twenty-first century. However, this simply is not something that can be handled right away. Thatâs why we set as our target year 2050, which is 50 years before the centuryâs end.

347,35,0.348,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Various actors (e.g. policy-makers, social scientists, civil society organisations, etc.) generally agree that for societies to be able to manage and govern large-scale environmental risks, there is a need for transnational communication and multistakeholder participation, as well as for increased involvement of citizens through various processes of deliberation. For example, several scholars have argued for the need to facilitate stakeholder inclusion and deliberation in the governance of the marine environment and natural resources such as fish (cf. Jentoft and Chuenpagdee 2015; Mackinson et al. 2011). To facilitate stakeholder inclusion and participation, several new institutional arrangements have also been discussed, such as âjoint environmental policy-makingâ (Mol et al. 2000), âmulti-stakeholder dialogueâ (Bendell 2000) and âpartnershipâ (Glasbergen et al. 2007). In the governance of regional seas such as the Baltic Sea, collaboration fostering initiatives by nongovernmental and subnational organisations (Kern and LÃ¶ffelsend 2004), as well as transnational stakeholder networks, have also been found to be influential in many environmental governance contexts (Kern and Bulkeley 2009). Adding to this complexity, the institutions for Baltic Sea environmental governance have developed rather rapidly over the last few years in the form of venues for stakeholder participation such as the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) in EU fisheries management (e.g. Linke et al. 2011) and stakeholder forums organised by HELCOM (e.g. Hassler et al. 2013). A core question is, however, to what extent these complex stakeholder arrangements open up collaboration and learning as opposed to impede possibilities to, for example, bridge sectoral interests. Previous research on environmental governance has revealed several benefits of inclusive, communicative and participatory approaches (e.g. Lafferty and Meadowcroft 1996; Lovan et al. 2004), but also situations when participation may not be successful (e.g. BostrÃ¶m 2006). The advantages of more inclusive governance approaches relate to normative and instrumental reasons. Broad inclusion can be seen as normatively (intrinsically) âgoodâ because the idea of inclusiveness responds to democratic ideals around socially just representation. Citizens that are potentially affected by, for example, environmental pollution should be given access to data and processes and provided with opportunities to voice their concerns in communicative and even judicial forums, a principle established, for example, by the Aarhus convention (UN ECE 1998). The academic literature also discusses instrumental reasons for inclusiveness (e.g. BostrÃ¶m 2006; JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016). For example, it has been argued that inclusiveness generates new and more socially"
214,480,0.348,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"The key to using climate model output is understanding the credibility of the model, the legitimacy of the model, and the salience or relevance of the projection. Credibility comes from the type of model and the model development process. Legitimacy comes from a detailed understanding of uncertainty in all its dimensions for a particular problem. Salience (relevance) comes from understanding of a particular problem. Climate model output must be made relevant, and having translators or interpreters familiar with a particular application has been effective in many cases. Climate information in many cases is just one dimension of a problem, and it may not be the dominant dimension of uncertainty, particularly where the human sphere is involved. It may matter more how society changes than how climate changes to determine the load on a particular resource (e.g., water, land). So climate model output must be put into perspective, and uncertainty assessed against particular problems to determine salience. The use of interpreters and a focus on salience allows the dimensions of uncertainty to be reduced. These dimensions are different for particular problems. The prediction problem determines the timescale, and that determines the balance of scenario, initial condition, and model uncertainty. It may also help determine how to construct an ensemble of models for a particular problem. And the particular impacts determine what portions of model uncertainty are most important. Examples of particular aspects of model performance include intense summer convective precipitation over a region, or a particular mode of climate variability like tropical cyclones, the Asian monsoon, or blocking events. Focusing on a particular process allows a better assessment of uncertainty in a particular model, or an ensemble of models. This can be done with speciï¬c observations. It also helps to ï¬t the model output into a particular problem, and getting the particular data on the right spatial and time scales. We hope that this approach is useful in helping to frame the problem of assessment and use of climate models from broad uncertainties to speciï¬c and more tractable uncertainties. These uncertainties can be qualitative or, when narrowed sufï¬ciently, even made quantitative. For most problems, if framed in this way, it is not necessary to wait to use a future model with reduced uncertainty, and the âbestâ model or set of models may be different for different processes. Climate models provide a wealth of salient information that is ready to be interpreted and assessed to make speciï¬c projections."

223,24,0.348,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Recent Developments in Decision-Making Theories and Geographies of Science: Improvements in the Understanding of Relations Between Knowledge, Action, and Space In proposing to use theories of heuristics13 and nonrational tools, Gigerenzer and his collaborators have introduced a concept they call ecological rationality (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011; 2015; Gigerenzer & Selten, 2001; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002; Samuels & Stich, 2015; Todd, Gigerenzer, & ABC Research Group, 2012). Unlike rational choice theories, heuristic theories of decision-making are concerned with psychological realism relating to the capacities and limitations of actual humans and emphasize the importance of a specific context, frame, or environment and focus on the performance of actors in the external physical and social world (Buskens, 2015, p. 903; Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, pp. 911â912; Hertwig & Herzog, 2009; Lindenberg, 2013; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2000). In a world where not all risks are known and where optimization is not feasible, ânonrationalâ tools such as heuristics are neededâ¦[N]onrational theories apply to âdecisionmaking under uncertainty,â where not all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are known or knowableâ¦Rational theories, in contrast, are tailored to situations where all risks are known. (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 911) The study of the ecological rationality of heuristics,14 or strategies in general, is a framework to study performance in the external world: A heuristic is ecologically rational to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of the environment. Heuristics are âdomain-specificâ rather than âdomain-generalâ; that is, they work in a class of environments in which they are ecologically rational. Heuristics provide not a universal rational calculus but a set of domain-specific mechanismsâ¦, and have been referred to collectively as the âadaptive toolboxâ. (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 912) âA heuristic is not per se rational or irrational; rather, its rationality depends on the match between the architecture of the tool and the structure of the environment in which it is employedâ (Hertwig & Herzog, 2009, p. 668). âAn inferential or judgmental strategy is ecologically rational if it is accurate and efficient on the sorts of tasks that were important in the environments in which we evolvedâ (Samuels & Stich, 2015, p. 722). âA heuristic is a strategy that ignores part of the information, with the goal of making decisions more accurately, quickly, and frugally (i.e., with fewer pieces of information) compared to more complex methodsâ (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 913). âA heuristic is ecologically rational to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of the environment. Heuristics are âdomain-specificâ rather than âdomain-generalâ; that is, they work in a class of environments in which they are ecologically rational. Heuristics provide not a universal rational calculus but a set of domain-specific mechanismsâ (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 912)."

Annual outbreaks on trout farms may be due to persistence of the virus in the local environment or reinfection from wild redfin perch. Natural epizootics in redfin perch occur most often in summer, and there is evidence of a positive relationship between EHNV pathogenicity and water temperature. Redfin perch are not susceptible to EHNV below 10 Â°C, and incubation periods for the virus are shorter at higher temperatures (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995). In rainbow trout, EHNV outbreaks have occurred between 11 and 20 Â°C (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995; Whittington et al. 1994, 1999). Temperature-dependent pathogenicity may be related to viral replication rates (Ariel et al. 2009). The first transmission studies with EHNV were conducted by Langdon (1989) who identified a wide range of susceptible hosts, a factor that contributed to the listing of EHNV by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). Although there are recognized deficiencies in laboratory challenge models to determine the susceptibility of host fish to virus isolates under natural conditions, a potential increase in the host range of EHNV infections has been predicted. In three separate challenge studies, black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), pike (Esox Lucius), and pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) experienced significant mortality following bath exposure to EHNV (Bang-Jensen et al. 2009, 2011a; Gobbo et al. 2010). On the other hand, goldfish (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and European sheatfish (Silurus glanis) did not experience significant mortality following bath exposure to EHNV (Bang-Jensen et al. 2011b; Leimbach et al. 2014). Like other ranaviruses, the outcome of EHNV infection may depend on various viral, host, and environmental factors including: virus concentration and route of delivery, viral strain, host genetics, host density and age, and water temperature (Brunner et al. 2015). For example, lower mortality was observed when European redfin perch stocks were challenged with EHNV, but it was these individuals that caused transmission of the pathogen to and extensive mortality in Australian redfin perch that were cohoused with them (Ariel and Bang-Jensen 2009)."

The present text focuses on scenarios used by the IPCC in its assessment reports released between 2001 and 2014 (IPCC Third Assessment Report, TAR; IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, AR4; IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, AR5; as well as special reports) as they cover the majority of scenario-driven climate change and impact studies reported in the various chapters of the present assessment. A dedicated activity to build the scenarios used in TAR and AR4 resulted in the so-called Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC 2000). The latest set of scenarios, used in AR5, followed a new approach for scenario development that uses so-called representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of future forcing and in parallel (or as a follow-up process) examined the range of socio-economic assumptions in model runs consistent with the RCPs, sharing during this step prior experience in the use of narratives and scenarios (Moss et al. 2010; van Vuuren et al. 2011a).

341,301,0.347,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"IWRM is considered to be a central concept in contemporary water governance (White 1998; Lubell and Edelenbos 2013). The key feature of IWRM is âintegrationâ, which is a normative goal that can refer to the integration of fragmented responsibilities for water governance (functions), institutional fragmentation (e.g. Wallis and Ison 2011b) and societal fragmentation (Lubell and Edelenbos 2013). The latter, societal fragmentation, is characterised by a disconnect between those making decisions and those affected by them. IWRM promotes stakeholder participation through some platform or institutional arrangement that promotes inclusion. However, as Warner (2006) found in an assessment of multi-stakeholder platforms in managing catchments, a realistic assessment of their purpose and capacity to achieve this ought to be considered before initiation. A finding from SLIM research (Ison et al. 2007), in which 14 empirical case studies of water governance platforms were undertaken, was that the existence of a multi-stakeholder platform, i.e. of multi-stakeholder institutions, did not guarantee effective performances that could be said to constitute social learning. How is IWRM suited to governing the relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments? One enduring challenge that Molle (2009) highlighted is managing interconnected and nested biophysical landscapes with disconnected administrative and social systems. Inclusiveness in IWRM could help âconnectâ social systems, achieving a greater variety of participants particularly through inclusion of people with local-scale interests. Institutional barriers, such as the centralisation of policy and lack of support for local capacity to implement IWRM (Medema et al. 2008), are both impediments to and arguments for greater inclusiveness. Despite the duration of IWRM as a governance framing choice (White 1998), what has not become clear is a praxis (or praxeology) of IWRM including the institutional forms needed to support this praxis. In this framing, the perennial issue is how to address the question: what do actors need to experience to claim that integration has occurred? In our experience, this question is rarely addressed well, in situations where integration is sought or claimed."

198,471,0.347,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"explored by analyzing the relationships between climatic and agricultural variables (Di Falco et al. 2011). In practice, continued refinement of soil, water, tree and crop management practices will contribute much of the required adaptation, except in systems that are already water stressed (Turral et al. 2011). However, while it is globally acknowledged that food productivity contributes to food security, post-harvest processes are also important. Furthermore, since their own agricultural activities are the primary sources of food for many people in developing countries, effects of climatic changes on crop productivity (and the peopleâs responses to them) will strongly influence their overall food security (Ingram et al. 2008). Hence, efforts to ensure food security must include strengthening of the adaptive capacity (Plummer and Armitage 2010) of individuals, households and communities by improving their access to, knowledge of, and control over natural, human, social, physical and financial resources (Pramova and Locatelli 2013). For these reasons, several authors (Pittock and Jones 2000; Stafford Smith et al. 2011) have argued that adaptation to climate change needs to be seen as an iterative process. If so, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation and/or progress towards it are clearly important to assess the effectiveness of adaptation interventions, options and technologies (UNFCCC 2010). However, there are uncertainties regarding appropriate adaptation indicators. Ideally, they should be different but complementary to development variables, but current approaches to adaptation M&E do not take this distinction into account. This chapter describes efforts to improve the design and implementation of adaptation M&E, at program and project levels, undertaken in a CGIAR Research Program (CRP7). Specific objectives were: (i) to demonstrate the applicability and utility of the theory of planned behavioral changes for adaptation M&E, focusing on adaptive capacity, and (ii) contribute to the development of an integrated biophysical-behavioral changes approach to adaptation M&E."
278,222,0.347,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"There is strong consensus among scientists that climate change is upon us and that mitigation action is both worthwhile and urgent (UNFCCC 2011; IPCC 2014a). At the same time, there is widespread recognition that the poverty and inequality in the developing world is unsustainable and there are internationally agreed goals to rectify this (UN 2012). Climate change research has deï¬ned the problem: through measuring and modelling the ï¬ows of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), monitoring extreme weather events, acidiï¬cation of oceans and other observations, the causes and consequences of climate change have been identiï¬ed. We can attribute global climate change to a host of different economic activities with some degree of spatial detail (e.g. Hertwich and Peters 2009; Peters 2010). Current mainstream models for climate change mitigation (CCM) frame the problem predominantly as one of the energy systems and one that is located where energy or emissions are produced or where energy is ï¬nally consumed. They emphasise energy and emissions directly or indirectly associated with activity in different sectors of society (including land use change) â see Fig. 6.1 â but they omit (1) the linkages between energy use sectors through nonenergy resource ï¬ows, (2) the drivers of resource use (e.g. from infrastructure development) and (3) the secondary resource availability (e.g. from infrastructure retirement). Thus, the current mainstream CCM models omit the material boundary conditions of the global system and opportunities for energy and emissions saving through recycling and reuse of materials. When we refer to solutions, we ask: âwhat can we do about climate change?â What are the technical and behavioural responses to the challenge? Analysis of energy and emissions ï¬ows is essential but insufï¬cient to address these questions"

341,36,0.347,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter the authors have presented a narrative that supports their normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance. Jennifer McKay presents a portfolio-based approach to planning and management and argues that rapid urbanisation, growing urban populations, environmental issues and climate change all present significant challenges for water resource management, the delivery of essential water and sanitation services and environmental protection. As a result, traditional approaches that have relied heavily on large-scale infrastructure development are making way for new approaches such as the portfolio-based approach to planning and management. In an urban context this includes integration of all components of the urban water cycle, and most state governments in Australia have embarked on implementing this integrated approach by having a mix of water supply sources including demand management and conservation measures. However, effective implementation of this approach depends on policies and regulations and encounters various impediments. Accordingly, this chapter focuses on the City of Adelaide in South Australia and explores the legal and policy challenges for implementing an integrated urban water management plan in Metropolitan Adelaide. Drawing on the results of governance studies carried out in Australia that included a literature review and stakeholder and community surveys, this chapter attempts to better understand the barriers to transitioning Adelaide to a water-sensitive city. With regard to implementing an integrated urban water management strategy in Australia, there is no âone size fits allâ structural arrangement. Although there is growing support for implementing a portfolio of water supply sources, it is also true that there are impediments to implementing this approach. The authors caution that achieving (cultural) transformations to encourage institutional change for implementation of an integrated urban water management approach may take several years, and therefore planners and policy-makers must have a long-term framework for addressing these issues. Looking ahead, there is scope for further research to explore the intergovernmental issues and provide models to enable this transition and hence be a model for the world in portfolio approaches. Marguerite de Chaisemartin provides an overview and thus contributes to a better understanding of the worldâs groundwater resource, its distinctiveness and its governance â describing the principal elements of and key instruments employed in groundwater governance. To this end, the authors introduce several case studies from across the globe and offer some corresponding lessons learnt. In particular, this chapter presents an analysis of the role of monitoring and assessment in groundwater governance, showcasing the example of the Netherlands. A global diagnostic of the current state of groundwater governance is provided, based on information from a set of commissioned thematic papers and the outcomes of five subsequent regional consultations carried out within the framework of a GEF-supported project on Global Groundwater Governance.

The resulting increased number of patients needing hospital beds has overwhelmed even the surge capacity of the CCUs of a metropolitan cityâs tertiary care hospitals. To meet this challenge, a teleconference has been scheduled between several members of the hospitalsâ administration, the CCU directors from each hospital, and public health officials involved in leading the jurisdictionâs pandemic response. As a public health official who played a central role in developing the pandemic plan for your jurisdiction, you have been included on the call to provide guidance for the pandemic response. During the meeting, a number of CCU directors report that their physicians and nurses are concerned about the type of patients being admitted into the CCU. Some of the directors see a trend that they suggest is ultimately undermining the efficiency of the pandemic response. They argue that, as the severity of the pandemic continues to increase, their triage criteria should be modified so as to use CCU resources to save the most lives possible. They worry that admitting those who present with the most need is preventing treatment of those who will benefit most from CCU admission. âSo long as our triage scheme saves the most lives, it is ethically justifiableâ a number of them declare. The group takes up the proposal of a CCU director to triage according to Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoresâwhich are derived using a tool that determines a patientâs organ function and failure rate to predict outcomes (Vincent et al. 2000). Were the pandemicâs severity to increase, the group suggests that, in addition to the CCU directorâs proposal to use SOFA criteria, even more inclusion, exclusion, and priority criteria could be added with the goal of saving as many lives as possible. Theyâve proposed exclusion criteria for CCU admittance that include patients with a poor prognosis, patients with other known health issues, and some mention of age cut-offs, to name a few. Others involved in the teleconference question whether this is the right approach to take. They argue that, by aiming to save the most lives possible, those who may benefit less from CCU admission, like older adults or individuals with disabilities, will be unfairly affected. They say, âwe should not just aim to save lives, but rather save lives fairly.â As you and your public health colleagues are leading the pandemic response, the hospital administrators and CCU directors look to you for a recommendation or decision about how to proceed."

These images can also tell us how OH advocates understand relationships between humans, animals and environmentsâas they are and how OH believes they should be. Humans appear regularly, talking to each other, caring for animals, working in laboratories, or as human hands. OH depicts itself as a form of care of animals, environments and the planet. Implicitly or explicitly, this imagery shares the assumption that humans must care via forms of custodianship where only human agency is made visible. In first world contexts we see familial or clinical scenes, most often with pets; in images of the global South and East we see small-scale, direct agricultural care and veterinary care of wildlife. In this way, OH indicates its globalizing ambition alongside its awareness of key differences in humanâanimal relationships in different parts of the world. Care and risk are held in balance, particularly in the context of zoonotic diseases, which by implication come from less appealing wildlife species and from modes of humanâanimal interactions that occur in traditional food and farming systems. This narrative casts animals and certain kinds of human as âguilty victimsâ, geographically far away from the global North, or socially excluded, who must be kept out at all costs.99 It is also at odds with emerging OH research which suggests that pandemic disease risks may be accentuated not by traditional but by modern intensive farming systems and the global distribution of their products.100 finally, it is worth observing that as time goes on, the imagery of OH has become more and more abstracted: following John Berger, the animals are literally disappearing from a movement primarily led by people concerned with animal health.101"
378,111,0.347,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,The technical term for what has become the ârepresentative agentâ in mainstream economic models is âHomo economicus.â Its character is the embodiment of the ï¬rst law of the human condition: constantly seeking to improve the hedonic calculus and constantly comparing and competing with others over scarce resources and best offers. The costâbeneï¬t analyses that this agent undertakes lie at the heart of explaining human behavior and the choices that should be expected. The ï¬nancial crisis has shown how helpful the resulting predictions are for complex real world dynamics. But this is not the topic at hand. We want to stay with the assessment of how key ideas and concepts of the mainstream economic paradigm not only limit which development solutions are imaginable and justiï¬able but also how their incorporation in culture and institutions drives societies away from sustainable outcomes.

187,95,0.346,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"The term âVulnerabilityâ is used here to describe the dependency between a well-deï¬ned threat and the disruption mode and mechanism of a well-deï¬ned CI. Obviously, a given CI may show different types of disruption modes depending on the disruption mechanism and the vulnerability of this mechanism to the threat. Also, a CI does not react to all threats in the same manner. CI disruptions are fundamentally stochastic processes. They can then occur independently from threats, as well. The occurrence of disruptions in the absence of threats will be called âsystemicâ disruptions. If disruptions are the result of the occurrence of a threat, they will be called âstressed disruptionsâ. Stressed disruptions depend on the vulnerability of the CIs to the stressing threat. Most of the models describe CIs vulnerability to threats using one the following approaches: â¢ Qualitative approach; it describes the vulnerability using a qualitative metric such as: extreme vulnerability, vulnerable, medium, low and not vulnerable. â¢ Binary approach; it describes vulnerability using a binary function [1, 0]. The value 1 means that the CI is vulnerable to the threat, i.e., if the threat happens, the disruption will certainly occur. The value 0 means that the CI is not vulnerable to the threat, i.e., if the threat happens, no disruption occurs."
278,18,0.346,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"I ï½ P ï´ Aï´T where I represents the impact of human activities on the environment, P is the human population, A is a measure of affluence (usually interpreted as average per capita GDP) and T is a measure of technological efficiency of consumption: T ï½ ï¨ Environmental impact ï© / ï¨Unit of GDP ï© . The IPAT relationship in this simplistic form was originally deployed to frame discussions over the extent to which technological advances could offset growth in population and affluence; for example, âclean technologyâ is conceived as an approach to reducing the T term (see Clift and Longley 1994). However, the recognition that well-being or quality of life is distinct from consumption as measured by GDP has led to a different discussion in industrial ecology and other circles: how can a good quality of life, the focus of the Social equity lobe in Fig. 1.1, be maintained within the constraints represented by the Environmental compatibility lobe? This means questioning whether A really needs to increase (see, e.g. Jackson 2009), as well as how far P will increase and whether reducing T can offset these increases. Like Whiteâs (1994) definition of industrial ecology, the IPAT relationship is generally conceived in terms of consumption flows â GDP â but the debate in industrial ecology increasingly refers to the importance of social, environmental and manufactured stock. The distinction between stocks and flows is therefore important; many of the chapters in this book focus on it. The terminology comes from economics, but the concepts underlie many other disciplines, including most branches of engineering. A flow variable is one that has a time dimension or flows over time, like the flow in a stream. A stock variable measures a quantity at a particular instant, like the quantity of water in a lake. An individual item in the stock may have a limited life (or, in engineering terms, a limited âresidence timeâ). Income is a flow; wealth is a stock. A fleet of vehicles is a stock, but the fuel as it is burnt and the rate at which new vehicles enter service are both flows. A consumer making a purchase drives production, which is a flow; the object purchased then joins the stock of articles, such as appliances and clothing, in the consumerâs home."
376,824,0.346,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Human activities can fundamentally alter the social-ecological interactions within rangeland systems (Stafford Smith et al. 2007), particularly as enterprise owners and managers respond to biophysical drivers such as climate, or socioeconomic drivers such as local, regional, and international markets (Reynolds and Stafford Smith 2002; Reynolds et al. 2007; Chap. 8, this volume). Semiarid and arid rangeland systems may be among the most tightly coupled socio-ecological systems because of the high degree of climate variability and dependency among system components (Stafford Smith et al. 2007). We look to studies of past management response to change for insights that could benefit climate change adaptation. Drought is a normal part of climate and, although common in arid and semiarid rangelands, drought can occur in all types of climate (Thurow and Taylor 1999; Wilhite and Buchanan-Smith 2005). Drought is referred to as a slow-onset natural hazard, where effects of drought accumulate slowly over time. This slow onset, and the temporary nature of drought, often leads to a lagged response by landowners and managers. Drought impacts can be costly, with reductions in water supplies, forage, and livestock productivity. Herd liquidations, one response to drought, often occur on the downside of the price curve for livestock and restocking on the upside of the price curve (Bastian et al. 2006), resulting in financial challenges for the landowner (Torell et al. 2010). Drought has been a learning experience at the scale of an individual livestock enterprise; however, some enterprises may still be underprepared for subsequent droughts. Over 500 cattle ranchers in the state of Utah were surveyed after the 1999â2004 drought, described as the sixth most severe drought since 1898 in Utah (Coppock 2011). Herd size varied from less than 5 brood cows to over 300 head and grazed ecosystems included desert, grassland, and high-elevation grasslands. Only 14 % of cattle enterprises were prepared for the 1999â2004 drought. The experience of this drought increased the number of ranchers that self-identified as being better prepared for subsequent drought to 29 % when they were surveyed in 2006. A negative experience in the 1999â2004 drought and the perception that another drought was inevitable were primary motivations for increasing drought preparedness. The most common risk management actions put in place by ranchers after the 1999â 2004 drought included improving water for livestock, and diversifying family income (Table 15.2). While adaptive capacity for drought improved with this experience, still greater than 50 % of the livestock operators were only somewhat prepared or not prepared for the next drought. This lack of adaptive capacity ensures that crisis drought management will begin again when the next drought occurs."

164,126,0.346,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","social and cultural cohesion and adaptive abilities have been lost, preventing the rebuilding of society (Volkan 2000). In the case of ârigidity traps,â decision circuits are highly interconnected, reinforcing themselves and making the system inflexible (Gunderson and Holling 2002). A good example is an old forest where larger, wellestablished trees inhibit the growth of saplings, impeding the renewal of the forest as a whole and increasing vulnerability to disturbances such as wildfire (Carpenter and Brock 2008). A corresponding social example would be the case of authoritarian governments where vertical decision-making structures impede innovation and adaptation, that tend to collapse when the overall settings such as democratic values become gradually hegemonic. Preventing the marginalization of a human community by increasing its resilience and adaptive capacity cannot be achieved by concentrating on a single component without considering other interlinked components of the SES. Contrarily it must fulfill various complementary and successive goals (e.g., guaranteeing food security, creating income generating opportunities, and maintaining ecosystem services)â goals which aim at improving the conditions for living systems, either social or ecological. In consequence any intervention to prevent and eventually reduce marginality should consider the functionality of the components of the SES and the involved processes. Moreover these efforts need to acknowledge the complexity of SES and therefore adopt systemic principles that allow the identification and characterization of the components, and consideration of the context, boundaries, connectedness, feedback, inflows and outflows as proposed by the âEcosystem Approachâ (Waltner-Toews et al. 2008), and further elaborated by Gatzweiler et al. (2011) in the context of social marginality."
92,158,0.346,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Another outcome of the chapters and primarily a result of the PINGH structure is an opportunity to advance the focus of global health collaborations and research with students and community partners. One might argue that this type of research already exists within other health-related organizations; however, the types of conversations, projects, and research carried out within PINGH highlight the impact that can happen when the community works with students in the co-creation of the knowledge and research. Take for example the Project Redemption project from Chap. 6, which highlights what can happen when communities that have often been overlooked are included as contributing participants and central to the core theme of the study. In other chapters (see Chaps. 4 or 7), the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students was purposeful and impactful to not only the students but also provided useful information on potential changes that could ultimately influence how to better integrate students into other programmatic roles of these global health programs. Furthermore, book chapters reveal challenges when working with global partners such as access and transparency of national data or access to other pertinent information. Despite these issues, authors recognized through these types of global health projects, greater awareness and policies (both PINGH and national/regional country policies) could be developed to address some of these limitations that impact programs. Another important issue raised across most chapters was the significance of a robust program design. When programs are strategically developed to include students (graduate and undergraduate), develop and challenge learning, incorporate community voice, and acknowledge critical reflection, there is an opportunity to change the status quo of student learning in global contexts. These components contribute to a learning environment that provides the student and the community with an opportunity to contribute to the learning process and ultimately create an experience that is meaningful to all. In reviewing the system of PINGH and its goals, there were three common themes found in all the chapters. Projects and activities highlighted the elements of a network that values (1) community voice and inclusivity, (2) student engagement and contributions, and (3) faculty and site collaboration."
182,246,0.346,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"On the level of the population, then, through a complex of culturebound interactions between humans and dogs, Schwabe had discovered another way in which E. granulosus responded to and shaped its environment. In this case, statistics captured how the parasite infiltrated the cultural ecosystem of Lebanese society. Dogs were ascribed a variety of roles, from companions to stray mongrels, some welcomed into the human sphere and some excluded from it. In either case, canine relationships with humans became a key ecological factor that enabled or obstructed the parasiteâs passage to humans. In invoking the importance of these domestic social relationships alongside surgical data, Schwabe used ephemeral connections between humans and dogs to follow the parasitic animal as it moved from one host ecosystem to another. The parasitological research tradition had been driven in just this manner, by animals such as E. granulosus, which, in responding to their environments, often created new symbiotic relationships that were based on the biological qualities of the host animalâSchwabe expanded on this tradition in his explicit inclusion of their social and cultural behaviours as well. With his success at AUB, Schwabeâs sphere of influence grew and he increasingly took to the global health stage. In Beirut he had pursued E. granulosus into the human realm, finding that movement between nonhuman and human research gave him a fuller sense of the parasiteâs biology. This work only expanded when the WHO first asked him to travel on their behalf in 1960, contracting him to visit Cyprus and investigate the islandâs endemic E. granulosus. This trip was quickly followed by a series of trips to multiple far-flung centres of E. granulosus infection, from New Zealand to Argentina, which would mark the initiation of the WHOâs global effort to control the disease.36 Most critical for his own career at this time, however, was Schwabeâs trip to Kenya in January 1961, on a fulbright Scholarship that would relocate his family to a home outside Nairobi for the entire year.37 While Schwabeâs explicit goal during his stay in Kenya was to finish writing the manuscript that would become his first edition of VMHH, he pursued the E. granulosus parasite into this new setting as well.

For example, surveillance is within the scope of Art. 9â11 HD, entailed by the duties to report and research in Art. 17 and 18 HD. The situation is similar regarding the WFD. Whilst the monitoring programmes stipulated in Art. 8 WFD are generally not designed to cater for the need to identify and monitor climatic aspects, they will inherently contribute to the detection and understanding of aspects of climate change (EC 2009, p. 50). The Birds Directive contains no monitoring duties, but it does stipulate research and reporting obligations (Art. 10 and 12 BD). Most significantly, on the level of an individual protected area, management planning according to Art. 6 (1) HD induces the scope of monitoring needed in order to identify the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types that are protected in the area and under the prevalent conditions (Schumacher and Schumacher 2012, p. 120). The general deterioration prohibition, Art. 6 (2) HD, and the assessment of implications of plans and projects stipulated in Art. 6 (3), (4) HD serve the purpose of at least maintaining resilience, although improvement cannot be directly achieved with these instruments. With regard to climate change impacts, this"

Synergistic interactions, or winâwin conditions, indicate that management leading to the increase of one type of ecosystem service may result in the increase of other ecosystem services. For example, some ecosystem services respond similarly to specific management practices and ecological conditions, such as those that may lead to increased carbon sequestration then resulting in increased water holding capacity, and, many of them, such as cultural services and biodiversity conservation, produce multiple intertwined values (Bennett et al. 2009)."

Stakeholder mapping can be used to identify the core stakeholder functions in the sector and to assess how effectively they are carried out. Such mapping also highlights the interaction with, and the impact of stakeholders on, other areas that influence the water sector. Beyond the âtraditionalâ actors, new players have gained interest and influence in water governance (Fig. 3.4). Whilst the role of the private sector has been inclined to focus on companies delivering water supply and sanitation, businesses have paid increasing attention to water governance in their strategies, especially to cope with regulatory risks and to secure water allocation. In parallel, citizens and water user associations have gained increasing influence over political decisions on water. As risks of floods intensify, property developers are also gaining influence, as spatial development generates long-term liabilities and financial implications in terms of water management, such as compensation for the loss of green areas and water amenities. They can play an important role in harnessing new sources of finance and contributing to the development of nontechnical solutions to manage floods. Institutional investors (e.g. pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds) have also begun to factor environmental, social and governance issues into their decisionmaking process, and they are investing more and more in water infrastructure and utilities. Some stakeholder categories are frequently excluded from the process. These include women (as the primary users of water in many parts of the world, for domestic consumption, subsistence agriculture and health), youth (as the future generation that will need to solve issues related to water), the rural and urban poor (as the main consumers in informal urban and rural settlements) and indigenous and aboriginal"
246,136,0.345,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The Pervasive Impact of Humans Despite the existence of many large protected areas where human impacts are minimised, just about all predator-prey systems on earth are impacted by humans in various ways. The most obvious and immediate effect is through human induced mortality of both predators and prey. While some of the planetâs largest protected areas may insulate some large herbivores from human exploitation, there is still pervasive human impact through poaching and legal harvest within protected areas or on the herbivores that seasonally migrate outside the borders. For large carnivores, the situation is even worse as their wide-ranging movements more often carry them beyond protected area borders (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998). In a European context, where protected areas are often small, there are probably very few large predator individuals, let alone populations, that live their lives entirely inside protected areas (Linnell et al. 2001). In addition to the deliberate targeting of these species, there are many other sources of mortality which humans induce, such as through vehicle collisions (Langbein et al. 2011) and cases where disease is transferred from domestic to wild species. Furthermore, humans have very strong impacts on herbivores through their manipulation of habitats (see Chap. 8). Forestry and agricultural practices have dramatic impacts on vegetation structure and productivity that can have both positive and negative impacts on herbivore and carnivore populations (e.g. Gill et al. 1996; Torres et al. 2011). In general, small scale forestry and agriculture lead to situations that increase productivity and benefit many herbivores. The winter feeding of wild herbivores is a widespread activity across most of northern, eastern and central Europe which has the potential to greatly influence herbivore distribution and density (Putman et al. 2011). Long-term deposition of nitrogen and climate change can also have dramatic impacts on the productivity of vegetation (Holland et al. 2005). Another impact comes from competition between domestic and wild species. Domestic herbivore densities tend to exceed those of wild herbivores and can have dramatic impacts on habitat structure and the productivity of vegetation, as well as providing potential prey items for predators. In many areas, animals of domestic origin have been, and still are, critical prey for large carnivores (Mattisson et al. 2011; Peterson and Ciucci 2003). Even predators of domestic origin (domestic cats and dogs) can compete with wild predators. A final impact occurs through the behavioural disturbance that human presence and activity can induce in both predators and prey (Moen et al. 2012). Given the mobility of both large carnivores and large"
97,502,0.345,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","in Rio 1992, the idea of employing natural elements to substitute and complement man-made infrastructure and production systems is a rather recent development. During the last decades, there has been more and more research focusing on NBS (see as a general introduction ten Brink et al. 2012). At the same time there is an increasing interest on the political level (a prominent example provides the latest EU research strategy; see EC 2015). Nature-based solutions are multifunctional, i.e. they deliver manifold services at the same time. For example, an urban park is not only a place of recreation for people (and sometimes a touristic factor) but also a corner-stone for (urban) biodiversity. The park is providing cooling effects important for reducing heat stress induced by climate change, relieving public sewerage infrastructures in case of heavy rainfall by providing natural seepage, filtering particular matters and dust and reducing noise of, e.g. traffic, and is contributing to climate change mitigation via carbon sequestration of its vegetation. While on the one hand, the multifunctionality of NBS promises high social return on investments, since they simultaneously address several societal goals, it is on the other hand hard to develop financial arrangements for their realization, since their superiority only becomes visible if all services are considered. Sectorial returns, e.g. in terms of noise reduction, are often falling short of benefits provided by technical and grey infrastructure solutions such as noise-insulating walls. While there is yet lacking a clear definition (Potschin et al. 2015), the idea of employing nature to satisfy human needs has attracted both conservation experts such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2016) and major infrastructure investors such as the World Bank (2008). The expert group of the âNature-Based Solutions and Re-naturing Citiesâ of the European research programme Horizon 2020 defined NBS as actions inspired by, supported by or copied from nature; [â¦] [that] use the features and complex system processes of nature, such as its ability to store carbon and regulate water flows, in order to achieve desired outcomes, such as reduced disaster risk and an environment that improves human well-being and socially inclusive green growth (EC 2015, p. 24). The concept therefore aims at satisfying human needs by utilizing (cultivated and humanly formed) natural systems. Regarding the urban environment, the idea is to foster multifunctional green spaces, green roofs, roadside greeneries, etc. to improve human health and human well-being. There are potential similarities and overlaps to concepts such as the âecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem-based adaptation/mitigation and green and blue infrastructureâ (EC 2015, p. 24). Thus, many different aspects have been addressed from various perspectives; at the same time, however, many details have not been clarified yet. For an actual implementation, financing aspects are certainly among the issues which are of utmost importance. While we assume that there is no easy blueprint, one-size-fits-all solution, we aim at elaborating on the issue from a perspective of public finance and public choice. Hence, our basic premise is that, in urban areas, public bodies are central actors that provide the required investments for the implementation of NBS. The goal of this chapter is therefore to clarify how cities and municipalities may leverage required investment volumes for NBS. Focussing on municipal actors, the chapter serves three purposes:"

Finally, the approach of making more water available for drinking, irrigation, and industry has lead to signiï¬cant ecological disasters. The depletion of water resources f.e. has signiï¬cantly shrunk the Tchad Lake and the Aral sea and thus led to the salinization and the sterilization of vast areas that surround the sea. Furthermore, rivers do not carry sufï¬cient water downstream of dams leading to the disappearance of aquatic and non-aquatic species. While new initiatives like the EU Water Framework Directive do try to reduce the ecological impacts, many damages are still to be addressed. Because of the resistance and tensions at various scales, international institutions advocated a new water management approach in order to better integrate various national, regional, local stakeholders, as well as users from the agricultural, industrial, and drinking water sectors. The division and competition between these sectors led to conflicts and to the depletion of the resources as the water supply has been raised to solve or anticipate the conflicts between users. The new approach thus is the âIntegrated Water Resource Managementâ, which is closely linked to the river basin as the privileged territorial management unit."
180,371,0.345,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"In direct contrast to the approach taken in (V2), (V3) characterizes vulnerability by identifying it with some specific attribute, context, or group membership. This approach focuses on vulnerability in terms of something, such as physical vulnerability, social vulnerability, vulnerability in terms of lacking capacity, vulnerability in terms of belonging to a certain identifiable group, or vulnerability because of belonging to a marginalized population, etc. This approach to defining the concept is an excellent way of illustrating the sorts of conditions that we might want to pick out as requiring special consideration in terms of susceptibility to harm. As such, (V3) serves as a useful heuristic device because it gives examples of the sorts of things that are often considered vulnerabilities. However, this check-list approach is to borrow David Lewisâs (1986) phrase, an attempt at explanation by âway of example,â whereby we provide some key paradigmatic examples or illustrations of what constitutes vulnerability and state that vulnerabilities are âthese sorts of things.â This approach does a poor job of defining vulnerability.

231,207,0.345,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"This chapter examines past and present studies of variability and changes in atmospheric variables within the North Sea region over the instrumental period; roughly the past 200 years. The variables addressed are large-scale circulation, pressure and wind, surface air temperature, precipitation and radiative properties (clouds, solar radiation, and sunshine duration). Temperature has increased everywhere in the North Sea region, especially in spring and in the north. Precipitation has increased in the north and decreased in the south. There has been a north-eastward shift in storm tracks, which agrees with climate model projections. Due to large internal variability, it is not clear which aspects of the observed changes are due to anthropogenic activities and which are internally forced, and long-term trends are difï¬cult to deduce. The number of deep cyclones seems to have increased (but not the total number of cyclones). The persistence of circulation types seems to have increased over the past century, with âmore extremeâ extreme events. Changes in extreme weather events, however, are difï¬cult to assess due to changes in instrumentation, station relocations, and problems with digitisation. Without thorough quality control digitised datasets may be useless or even counterproductive. Reanalyses are useful as long as biases introduced by inhomogeneities are properly addressed. It is unclear to what extent circulation over the North Sea region is controlled by distant factors, especially changes in Arctic sea ice."

376,666,0.345,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Research on the effects of biodiversity on disease dynamics has been motivated, in part, by the example of Lyme disease (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000). The causative bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi is hosted by white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) that reach higher densities in less diverse ecosystems where mammalian mesopredators and avian raptors are rare or absent. An ensuing debate has concentrated on whether this represents a general relationship between higher biodiversity and lower disease or if this is idiosyncratic and system-specific (Lafferty 2012). Yet for parasites with complex lifestylesâsuch as trematodes, cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans, chytridiomycetes, oomycetes, and myxosporeans that move between multiple host species to complete their life cyclesâthere are multiple different mechanisms by which âdilutionâ or âdecoyâ effects could moderate disease prevalence (Johnson and Thieltges 2010). The debate over the impact of biodiversity on disease is similar to the debate over the mechanisms by which biodiversity may affect ecosystem processes (Loreau et al. 2001; Hooper et al. 2005). Traditionally parasites and pathogens were, and mostly still are, viewed as things to be controlled or eradicated where possible. More recently, however, researchers have been investigating the effects of parasites on ecosystem function and whether a stable and resilient ecosystem has a rich parasite assemblage (Hudson et al. 2006; Vannier-Santos and Lenzi 2011; Hatcher et al. 2012). Similarly, there is an explosion of research on the microbiome, or the microbial community within an individual, and how that community composition affects nutrition and obesity, immune function, disease risk, cancer, and so forth (Kau et al. 2011; Vannier-Santos and Lenzi 2011).

Target knowledge is defined as an understanding of actors, their interests, concerns and capacities, and it is developed on the basis of values and norms that guide decision-making. Social research may be used to describe the social sphere, but, again, the actors themselves share a detailed knowledge about its nature. So, the question whether and to what share fossil energy or renewable material-based resources shall be used in construction is one that is solved based on target knowledge. Finally, transformative knowledge provides answers about changing practices and institutions. While the first two types of knowledge are describing the status quo, and may help to define a desired future state, the transformative knowledge is crucial in order to describe a path, the operational steps from the current to a desired state (cf. Fig. 4.1). While the systems and target knowledge form a necessary prerequisite andâat least in principalâcan be undertaken in purely disciplinary scientific research manner, transformative knowledge can be understood as the essence of transdisciplinary research, in which multiple forms of scientific/ practical and multidisciplinary perspectives are combined and transformed."
55,128,0.344,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"and said very little about exogenous or endogenous candidiasis, at a time when nystatin was attracting attention. At the 1950 NYAS meeting, Samuel B. Salvin, then at the Division of Infectious Diseases at NIH, placed the incidence of fungal diseases in context of other infectious diseases. Fungus infections in man, although less frequent than bacterial, are still numerically important. For example, of the 92,933 deaths due to infections and parasitic diseases in the United States in 1945, 284, or 0.3 per cent, were due to mycoses. This was approximately equal to the number of deaths reported as caused by scarlet fever, measles, or the typhus-like diseases (due to rickettsia), and was more than the total of all deaths recorded from rabies, smallpox, relapsing fever, leprosy, brucellosis, paratyphoid fever, plague, cholera, and anthrax. It should be realized, of course, that effective control measures are employed against some of the aforementioned diseases, whereas control methods against the mycoses not only are not practiced, but, generally, are not even known. It should also be borne in mind that the dermatophytoses, although characteristically nonfatal, are extremely common, probably equalling the most widespread of the bacterial or virus diseases in prevalence.6 In 1953, Walter Nickerson from the Department of Microbiology, Rutgers University, tried a creative presentation of mortality data to chart the rise of fungal infections.7 He used graphs for the period 1945â1949 that showed starkly opposite mortality trends, where âall infectionsâ had dropped sharply, while that from mycoses had increased markedly. Nickerson had produced his graphic illustration by using very different scales for the two classes of infection. Deaths from mycoses were recorded as actual numbers, while those from all infections were recorded in thousands. The alarming increase of nearly 50% in fungal infection deaths was actually from 270 to 380, while the actual number of deaths from all infections had fallen 30%, from 93,000 to 66,000 deaths â still 170 times greater! In the event, the annual total deaths from mycoses in the next decade never reached 500.8 More telling was Nickersonâs point about morbidity; he stated that âmycotic infections are probably the mostly widely distributed and most numerous types of infection, with dermatophyte infections, such as athleteâs foot, alone as prevalent as the most widespread of the bacterial and virus diseasesâ.9 Medical mycologists had long argued for recognition of the distinctive pathogenicity of fungi.

198,37,0.344,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract In 2014, the second conference on evaluating climate change and development offered the opportunity to take stock of evaluative evidence of the challenges, failures and success of climate change action. In 2011 one of the authors raised the possibility of a micro-macro paradox of climate change action (van den Berg, Evaluation 17:405, 2011): in his view evaluations of climate change action provided evidence that climate action works and achieves direct impact â yet climate change seems unstoppable. Several major, comprehensive evaluations were presented at the 2014 conference and provided an overview of actions taken and their successes and failures, as well as obstacles on the way to global impact. This chapter presents an overview of issues, evidence and the way forward for evaluators tackling climate action and sustainable development. The evidence provides support for the micro-macro paradox of 2011 and indicates that the global community has the technology and knowledge on how to stop climate change. However, actions that promote climate change still outweigh remedial climate action with at least a factor of 100. Thus current successes of programs and projects will not impact global trends, unless at the same time the non-sustainable subsidies and actions are stopped.

Oteros-Rozas et al. (2014), for instance, describe a sociocultural valuation approach of ES that investigates peopleâs perceptions of the importance of ES in a cultural landscape. There are several other creative ideas from different researchers regarding nonmonetary assessment approaches. For instance, GarcÃ­a-Llorente et al. (2016) suggest that to analyze the social support for biodiversity conservation activities and the related delivery of ES, one calculates the willingness to give up time. Kumar and Kumar (2008) point to the need of considering psychological and sociological aspects in ecosystem service valuation. They argue that there is a need for approaches that combine natural and social science research."

This admittedly crude underestimate, and a few other early studies, stimulated a huge surge in interest in this topic. In 2005, the concept of ecosystem services gained broader attention when the United Nations published its Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005). The MEA was a four-year, 1,300-scientist study for policymakers. In 2008, a second international initiative was undertaken by the UN Environment Programme, called The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB 2010). The TEEB report was picked up extensively by the mass media, bringing ecosystem services to a broader audience. Hundreds of projects and groups are currently working towards better understanding, modelling, valuation and management of ecosystem services and natural capital. In 2012 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was established. IPBES is an intergovernmental body (similar to the IPCC) which provides information on the state of biodiversity and ecosystem services for decision-making purposes. Its current membership includes 126 national governments. Emerging global, national and regional networks like the Ecosystem Services Partnership (www.es-partnership.org) have also emerged. Ecosystem services are now poised to provide real solutions to the problem of how to sustainably manage our critical natural capital assets. From the perspective of ecosystem services, wetlands are among the most important and valuable ecosystems in the world (de Groot et al. 2012). The recognition of this value is a far cry from the situation not that long ago (and still prevalent in some places) when wetlands were considered to be âwastelandsâ and every effort was made to drain, fill and convert them to other land uses. Coastal wetlands, and in particular large river deltas, are especially important and valuable. River deltas contain the majority of coastal wetlands. However, they are also among the most impacted by human activities and 1 in 14 people globally live in deltaic regions (Day et al. 2016). The worldâs most populated delta is the GangesâBrahmaputraâMeghna in Bangladesh.

320,39,0.344,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"The Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007a) clearly underlined the existing trend of climate change. It projected future developments with dramatic impacts, such as increasing temperature, changes in both amount and distribution of precipitation, change of the climatic water balance, and the increasing occurrences of extreme events. These changes will have serious impacts on nature (IPCC 2007b) and endanger the natural heritage that is protected within nature reserves, national parks, biosphere reserves or other protection categories. These facts are already recognised on a European policy level: âClimate change has the potential, over a period of a few decades, to undermine our efforts for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversityâ (European Commission 2006, p. 13). Current discussions connected to climate change often focus on the prevention or mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Even though mitigation of climate change is of utmost importance, protected area administrations as well as nature protection authorities also need support on the political (administration) as well as on the practical level (management) in order to cope with climate change and their adaptation to it. To preserve ecosystems, habitats, and species, as well as their goods and services, for society under changing climatic conditions it is recommended to: â¢ identify potential climate change and land use-induced threats; â¢ model regional climate change effects and their potential impacts on protected areas (see Chaps. 2 and 3); â¢ evaluate existing management practices;"
175,25,0.344,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Water resource systems have beneï¬ted both people and their economies for many centuries. The services provided by such systems are multiple. Yet in many regions of the world they are not able to meet even basic drinking water and sanitation needs. Nor can many of these water resource systems support and maintain resilient biodiverse ecosystems. Typical causes include inappropriate, inadequate and/or degraded infrastructure, excessive withdrawals of river flows, pollution from industrial and agricultural activities, eutrophication resulting from nutrient loadings, salinization from irrigation return flows, infestations of exotic plant and animals, excessive ï¬sh harvesting, flood plain and habitat alteration from development activities, and changes in water and sediment flow regimes. The inability of water resource systems to meet the diverse needs for water often reflect failures in planning, management, and decision-makingâ and at levels broader than water. Planning, developing, and managing water resources to ensure adequate, inexpensive, and sustainable supplies and qualities of water for both humans and natural ecosystems can only succeed if we recognize and address the causal socioeconomic factors, such as inadequate education, corruption, population pressures, and poverty. Over the centuries, surface and ground waters have been a source of water supply for agricultural, municipal, and industrial consumers. Rivers have provided hydroelectric energy and inexpensive"
378,167,0.344,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"The following summary is thus also the conclusion of this chapter. It briefly runs through the four big ideas listed in Table 3.1 and why they fall short when we seek to understand how to satisfy human needs while respecting natureâs law. The discussions above have shown that they are scientiï¬cally flawed. Yet, through their materialization in todayâs market and government structures, these ideas have become very real in their impact on people, their decision-making and their freedom to do things differently and more sustainably. The reflexive ontology behind this book sees the opening up of worldviews and belief systems as the ï¬rst step in system innovation strategies: identify which arguments, practices or laws are built around flawed assumptions and ideas and understand how they hamper more sustainable developments. Engaging in transforming such path dependencies will of course always be a highly political, contested and power-ridden process whose outcome no one can predict. But shedding vested intellectual interests often comes before shedding economic vested interests: sense and legitimacy of the status quo start crumbling and alternative practices multiply, inspired by an emerging imaginary that there are indeed alternatives. Trying to understand the world by dividing it into pieces creates an imaginary in which the relationships and generative rules underlying system dynamics get lost behind numbers and detailed descriptions of the individual pieces. This atomistic view of mechanical systems suggests that the single items remain unchanged and between them one can detect and thus manage linear and reproducible causalities in an additive or subtractive approach. System dynamics are viewed as predictable and controllable as long as the properties of the individual parts are understood well. There are no time delays or feedback loops that allow one to anticipate the fact that stopping a particular cause will no longer stop a particular reaction once system dynamics have reached tipping points. General ignorance of the Tyranny of Small Decisions is related to this: large output changes need large input changes. It is this âparticleâ worldview or paradigm that leads to the common juxtaposition of incremental versus radical change. But applying this view to complex systems ï¬lled with humans is not helpful, as the ï¬nancial crises show. Using it to inform strategies of human need satisfaction offers very little insight about the matter it is supposed to address: utility or happiness is a relative and context-dependent experience and not a thing that can be privately held and hoarded. Meanwhile, natural capital is a web of life and not a"

170,110,0.343,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"5 Conclusion The debate on the impact of the information society on the Global South is ongoing and the jury is still out. In this chapter, we attempted to provide context and perspective to this debate. The misgivings of development planners, governments, and donors regarding the outcomes of ICT4D projects were reviewed. The contradictions attendant to evaluating ICT4D impacts were articulated. We discussed The Hague framework, described how it came about, and proposed a way forward, which was to construct theories of change for specific projects or programmes. The chapter presented a generic theory of change that established causal links between attributes of information society and the Millennium Development Goals. It developed indicative ToC maps or pathways to change applicable to eAgriculture, ICT for education, and KM for climate change adaptation. We capped the chapter by describing a possible downside to the use of theories of change. We said that ToCs may guide us in establishing causal links between ICTs and development in the Global South, but we can get blindsided by them. The parameters that we set in our impact evaluations sometimes act as horse blinders, denying us of our peripheral vision and preventing the full appreciation of the information society phenomenon. At a certain point in the evaluation process, we will have to remove these blinders and explore unintended outcomes or impacts."
118,342,0.343,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"The paradigm within which Industrial Age technologies are understood is based on an Enlightenment worldview. As said, this worldview is atomistic (reductionism), deterministic (cause and effect) and objectivistic (universal laws). In other words, the laws governing the behavior of these complicated systems can be: â¢ Understood by studying the behavior of their component parts, â¢ Deduced from cause and effect (a search for causal links or chains), and â¢ Determined independent of the observer, that is, only deduced from âobjectiveâ empirical observations. The context within which our Post-Industrial Age Technologies and their underlying science are understood is based on a nonlinear worldview. This worldview gives rise to complex systems that are characterized by at least one of the following [28]: â¢ Holistic/emergentâthe system has properties that are exhibited only by the whole and hence cannot be described in terms of its parts, â¢ Chaoticâsmall changes in input often lead to large changes in output and/or there may be many possible outputs for a given input, and â¢ Subjectiveâsome aspects of the system may only be described subjectively. It is often said that for complex systems, âthe whole is greater than the sum of its partsâ. What this means is that there is an emergent quality (sometimes called an emergent property) that is not exhibited by the parts alone. Examples include electric power transmission grids, the disposal of high-level radioactive waste, and the response of social systems to severe natural phenomena. I believe that the new issues regarding national and international security also fall into this category. In each case, the system is simultaneously a whole and a part of a larger whole, a characteristic of complex systems. It should be made crystal clear that the impacts of human activities on both society and the environment (from the development of the steam engine to the development of the jet engine) have always been complex. In the past, however, the only undesirable consequences of an Industrial Age technology, such as a nuclear power plant, that were considered in a PRA were geographically local (public health effects out to one mile or 25 miles) or they were observable in ârealâ time (a hydrogen explosion). This gave the impression that the current risk paradigm is accurate because locality and observability were two characteristics of the impact. This lens is changing, and yet our practices are still based on the same paradigm. That is, a nuclear power plant accident has âglobalâ impacts (an accident at one plant affects the operation of all plants) and manifests very quickly (e.g. loss of public confidence worldwide). In the case of disposal of radioactive waste, the undesirable consequences are almost imperceptible (e.g. the migration of high-level radioactive waste takes place over geological timescales or millennia). Moreover, these impacts may be temporally persistent and/or irreversible (e.g. the degradation of public welfare due to nuclear proliferation). Thus, as a result of the complexity inherent in Post-Industrial Age Technology, societal and environmental impacts are no longer geographically local, nor perceptible in real time, nor reversible. Rather, complexity can produce impacts that are"

But in view of the pressures, it implies the failure of his R-7 project. To make matters even worse, replication tests conducted in other labs are not getting the expected results.

Climate change studies indicate warming and drying trends, both in the recent past and future forecasts (Savage et al. 2009). Currently, unsustainable dryland cultivation is the greatest threat to livestock survival during winter, spring, and fall when the high-elevation summer pastures are unavailable. Sustainable dryland cultivation is the greatest threat in terms of the fragmentation of pastoral migration routes and staging areas.22 Both situations will only get worse if climate change scenarios are verified, as more cultivated areas are abandoned in the most fragile landscapes and drought becomes the norm rather than just a temporary or cyclic event. The Ethiopian situation illustrates too many people and livestock (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) exploiting a diminishing natural resource base. This trajectory was predicted over 20 years ago (Coppock 1994). Symptoms are ecological and socioeconomic (Coppock et al. 2014). The former include bush encroachment and gullying on certain soil types. The latter include land-use fragmentation due to de facto privatization of grassland parcels annexed from communal resources, loss of dry-season grazing to maize cultivation, and occupation of former drought grazing reserves by people who have arrived from overpopulated places elsewhere. Bush encroachment has been exacerbated by decades of overgrazing and (past) official bans on the use of prescribed fire that have shifted the competitive balance from perennial grasses to woody plants (Coppock 1994). This loss of grasses means a decline in fine fuels that are needed to carry fires that might otherwise control the recruitment of woody seedlings. Maize cultivation by pastoralists is a food insecurity response to a declining ratio of livestock to people and thus is symptomatic of the trend of increasing poverty (Desta and Coppock 2004). Chronic food insecurity has led to dependence on food aid, the provision of which effectively delays resolving the root causes of hunger (Coppock et al. 2014). The Sahel differs from southern Ethiopia in many respects, but shares some of the same broad outcomes. The Sahelian belt occurs at a continental scale, with far more variation in terms of climate, land use, and rangeland ecology (Table 17.1). Sahelian production systems vary from pure pastoralism to highly integrated agropastoralism where crop residues provide livestock fodder, and livestock manure enhances crop yields (Heasley and Delehanty 1996; Turner et al. 2014). In the Sahel the overall challenge for pastoralists is how to exploit the highly variable occurrence of fodder over space and time most efficiently. Fragmentation of landscapes and natural resource endowments has occurred due to population growth, spread of cultivation, and national policies that attempt to reassert tougher border controls, although efforts have occurred to accommodate pastoral mobility across national borders (Zoundi and Hitimana 2008). In some instances, however, cultivation has remained stable or retreated due to variation in local population growth and climate patterns (Tappan et al. 2004). Pressure on grazing resources from cultivation is particularly a problem in the southern Sahel where seasonal, long-distance livestock movements to the north during the rainy season (e.g., transhumance) have been"

Furthermore, they present a profoundly distorted impression of the human resource context within which Health Partnerships and professional volunteers are attempting to promote capacity building. This chapter takes the reader through our own learning from the starting position where we assumed that we were engaging with the simple inability of LMICs to fund the training and deployment of health workers (âthey need all the âhelpâ they can getâ approach) to our more contextualised understanding of the sheer complexity and power dynamics of human resource (mis)management. The immediate and obvious response to this simplistic âhealth worker shortagesâ model is a labour substitution or service-delivery intervention. This response, whilst appealing to the altruistic and clinical learning needs of volunteers, lacks sustainability. It also undermines public health systems. There is a strong tendency to assume that the solution to health systems crisis in countries like Uganda lies in clinical expertise and that clinicians are best poised to inï¬uence global health agenda. We have come to realise that this clinical expertise, whilst highly valuable, needs to be framed and managed within a much more multi-disciplinary and research-informed understanding of human resource systems. And this has important implications for the deployment and management of professional volunteers. The second part of the chapter introduces the concept of âco-presenceâ. Co-presence is a well-known concept in the highly skilled migration and knowledge mobilisation literature and our familiarity with this framed our approach to volunteer deployment. Put simply, unless volunteers are working in co-present (or face-to-face) relationships with their peers, we run the risk of labour substitution and also fail to create the environment conducive to knowledge exchange and mutual learning.1"
376,1022,0.343,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Our review of the six case-study sites has been limited in breadth and depth, but overall it indicates that a vast amount of new knowledge has been generated during the past 25 years. Over a generation has passed since the publication of seminal, synthetic works on rangeland ecology and management relevant to the developing world. These include efforts by Huss and Aguirre (1974) for Mexico, Penning de Vries and Djiteye (1982) and Le HouÃ©rou (1976) for the Sahel, Pratt and Gwynne (1977) for East Africa, as well as Florez and Malpartida (1988) for the Peruvian Andes, and Sandford (1983) for the developing world more broadly. Other books of the 1970s focused on North Americaâbut that ostensibly also had relevance to the developing worldâinclude Stoddart et al. (1975). When considering the body of work conducted in our case-study sites over the past 25 yearsâas well as the current priority rankings from Table 17.2âit is interesting to see how the overall thematic emphasis has changed. Taking the landmark works from the 1970s and 1980s as the baseline, there has been a decided shift from ecology-focused or top-down, technology-driven work to bottom-up, human-oriented work.42 Another notable transformation within the human dimension research sphere has been a shift from methods grounded in detached observation of human communities to one of active engagement and collaboration with communities as research partners. Twenty years ago, human-dimensions research almost solely consisted of surveys, interviews, and participant observationâand much of this effort was conducted by cultural anthropologists and economists. Today, there is far greater emphasis on participatory action research, participatory rural appraisal, and stakeholder involvement from a wide array of research angles, to the extent that pastoralists and policy makers are also active members of research teams. Finally, there is another trend to treat some development interventions as experiments with sound experimental designs and impact-monitoring protocols (Coppock et al. 2011). The ten coauthors of this chapter debated on the scholarly contributions that have most shaped their work over the past 25 years. About 10 works were nominated, and the top 5 are listed in Table 17.3. Prominent among the 5 are pieces related to systems thinking and integrated problem solving on pastoral lands. Most of these works offer different ways to better unify thought with respect to human and ecological processes."

72,10,0.343,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"natural sciences, most of the big 20th-century theoretical breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and biology did not arise in a detached ivory tower but as responses to the practical problems of the real world, and much of the theoretical distinction between basic and applied research, which became institutionally embodied in the late 20th century, misread that history â a point eloquently made in Jon Agarâs recent book (2013). Yet to describe the study of social innovation as a craft knowledge is not to imply any less need for research rigour. There is still a need for falsifiable hypotheses â the more clear-cut, or surprising, the better. There is certainly a need for data â time series data on the growth or decay of social organisations, their contribution to GDP, their social make-up, their geography, and so on â and we should hope that over the next decade social innovation can begin to catch up with the rapid progress being made in the statistical study of other fields of innovation. Examples of this include the progress being made in measuring intangibles, the pioneering work on measuring the creative economy (Bakhshi et al., 2012) and the use of web-scraping and other tools to show economic phenomena before they have been captured by official statistics (Bakhshi and Mateos-Garcia, 2012). That sort of rigour is bound to take research away from the immediate concerns of practitioners, and so a balance needs to be struck. The Italian philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci (1979) famously commented that we should cultivate pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will; perhaps what we most need here is to combine enthusiasm of the spirit and scepticism of the intellect. Striking that balance is a challenge both for the field and for individuals. Many individuals researching social innovation are also practitioners and activists; they are advocates as well as scholars, immersed in the mission as well as the measurement and analysis. This is bound to create tensions. But again, it is not so different from other areas of social science â from late 19th-century sociology to late 20th-century rational choice economics, many of the most apparently detached intellectuals were also in truth advocates for new ways of seeing the world and new ways of acting on it. Joseph Schumpeter, for example, was the finance minister of Austria in 1919 (Backhaus, 2003)."

Partners have agreed on a number of initial ï¬elds of cooperation in research and capacity building, coupled with social and ï¬nancial investment. These common interests will focus on new initiatives to study research frontiers in understanding landslide disaster risk, on development of people-centered early warning technologies for landslides, hazard and vulnerability mapping, and international teaching tools, as well as open communication of these results with society.

Early outcomes from the interventions was achieved around reduction of distances to water points, increased access to good quality water for the resident and neighbouring communities, increased capacity of traditional natural resource governance committees (dedhas), proper diagnosis of livestock diseases and strengthened local capacity for natural resource management. With respect to measuring resilience literature has shown that there are no universal or generally applicable indicators of resilience (or of vulnerability or adaptive capacity), as these phenomena are highly context-specific. However, a number of studies have sought to define dimensions of resilience, with each dimension gathering together a suite of related factors that might be represented by context-specific indicators (Alexander 201316; Nguyen and James 201317). However for the purposes of this study, social or livelihood resilience as defined by Eakin (2012)18 and Tanner et al. (2015)19 was used as it was fit for purpose."

347,72,0.343,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"However, studies of guideline, assessment and advice documents linked to MSFD (Udovyk and Gilek 2014) and the HELCOM BSAP (Udovyk and Gilek 2013) reveal a rather limited acknowledgement and management of uncertainty. In fact, irreducible uncertainties associated with ecosystem dynamics and interdependencies are rarely mentioned in assessments and science-based advice (Udovyk and Gilek 2013). Similarly, there are hardly any references to strategies or methods for coping with such uncertainty. Instead, in line with the notion of achieving âbest available knowledgeâ, assessment and advice documents mainly acknowledge uncertainty caused by low precision and accuracy in methods and a general lack of scientific data for certain geographical areas and ecological endpoints. The general strategy applied for managing epistemic uncertainty is to obtain more data through an expanded monitoring network, with larger geographic and temporal coverage (HELCOM 2009a). Such a traditional empirical approach in science has in many ways been successful in and instrumental to reaching a consensual understanding of the sources and impacts of eutrophication and of the importance of various nutrients (e.g. Conley et al. 2009a; Elmgren 2001). However, for generating science-based advice on nutrient reduction requirements to reach environmental objectives, alternative modelling approaches would be needed to better control uncertainty associated with ecosystem dynamics (e.g. Udovyk and Gilek 2013). Interestingly, however, our interviews revealed a not so uncommon âdownplayingâ of model and scenario uncertainties in science-policy interactions linked to development of BSAP. Presumably, this can to some extent be explained by a common ambition among scientists (Baltic Nest) and decision-makers (HELCOM) involved to facilitate a regional agreement on nutrient reduction targets (cf. Linke et al 2014). A strong acknowledgement of uncertainty could in this respect have been a reason for disagreement rather than agreement. An overview of scientific studies on Baltic Sea eutrophication exposes several scientific disagreements on the sources and impacts of eutrophication that in various ways have had significant repercussions on stakeholder conflicts and management decisions at national and regional levels (e.g. Elmgren 2001). At an early stage of Baltic-wide eutrophication assessment and management, there was in the 1960s a lively debate on whether or not anthropogenic eutrophication of the open Baltic Sea was possible at all. Once compelling evidence for such large-scale human-induced"

252,39,0.342,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Abstract This chapter discusses the relation between collective, individual, and institutional responsibilities with regard to the realization of herd immunity from certain infectious diseases. The argument is put forth that there is a form of collective moral obligation to realize herd immunity, that there is a principle of fairness in the distribution of the burdens of collective obligations, and that such principle entails that each of us has the individual moral responsibility to make their fair contribution to herd immunity through vaccination. These individual moral obligations, in turn, entail a further individual obligation to support policies aimed at realizing herd immunity. The chapter concludes with a suggestion that the individual moral obligations to support such policies generate an institutional responsibility to implement them.

347,28,0.342,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Over the last few decades, the term âgovernanceâ and the specific topic of this book â âenvironmental governanceâ â have become prevalent in the social and environmental science literature (e.g. SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). The concept of governance, first established in public administration and taken up in political science, is used to depict a shift in responsibility from state to non-state actors (e.g. private or voluntary sectors) that affects structures and processes for collective action and decision-making (Stoker 1998). It emphasises social and political steering and acting in polycentric networks on different levels â local, regional, national, European and global (e.g. Delmas and Young 2009; Rosenau 2003; Wagner 2005). However, there is a great variation in how governance is defined and used. In other words, it refers more to a perspective than a coherent theory (e.g. Pierre and Peters 2000; Rhodes 1996). Our definition in this volume includes both structures â such as policy contexts, existing power relations among key actors, regulatory frameworks and organisational forms of decision-making, reflexivity and participation â and processes. Processes comprise aspects such as the evolution of organisations and interactions between, for instance, science and policy, as well as communication and interaction among policy-makers, scientists and other stakeholders. Processes also include the development of strategies, framings, communication and learning. In many respects, EAM shares with environmental governance an interest in similar core topics, e.g. multilevel and multi-sector institutional interactions, knowledge integration and stakeholder arrangements and partnerships (SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). In addition, it offers several additional focal areas and assumptions of value to the comprehensive analysis of environmental governance aimed for in this book. To begin with, there is a fundamental ecosystem-based focus in EAM that assumes that sustainable management of human activities and pressures can only be achieved if it is based on the sensitivity and complexity of the ecosystem in focus. In line with"
214,25,0.342,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"In order to describe climate modeling and the climate system, it is necessary to have a common conception of exactly what we are trying to simulate, and what a model actually is. What is climate? What is a model? How do we measure the uncertainty in a model? This chapter introduces some key terms and concepts. We start with some basic deï¬nitions of climate and weather. Everyone will come to this book with a preconceived deï¬nition of what climate and weather are, but separating these concepts is important for understanding how modeling of climate and weather are similar and why they are different. It also makes sense to discuss what a model is. Even if we do not realize it, we use models all the time. So we describe a few different conceptual types of models and put climate models in context. Finally we introduce the concept of uncertainty. As we discuss later in the book, models may have errors and still be useful, but this requires understanding the errors (the uncertainties) and understanding where they come from. Most of these concepts are common to many types of modeling, and we provide examples throughout the text."
308,244,0.342,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Conclusion: What Should We Aim For? The World Health Organization (WHO) deï¬ned health as âa state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease.â It decided in Alma Ata (1978) that the world should reach this Utopian level by the year of 2000. By 2000, things got far worse than what they were in the 1970s of the twentieth century. We do not think it is practical to assume reaching that Utopian level of health all over the world. Let us be more pragmatic and aspire to have: (1) World peace (2) Equity in distribution of wealth: It is shameful to ï¬nd the wealthiest three have more than Gross National Product (GNP) of 35 developing nations whose populations exceed 600 million; and the 85 wealthiest persons own half the wealth of the whole world, and their income exceeds the income of 3500 millions of the world population. It is a disgrace to ï¬nd many millions dying from malnutrition, famines, diarrhea (6 million children die of diarrhea annually because of lack of clean potable water), malaria (more than 2 million die of malaria, mostly children in Africa), 2 million die of tuberculosis (mostly in Africa and many of them due to HIV). These inequalities could be corrected if the wealthy people and wealthy countries donate 2.5 % of their wealth to the poor and needy both in their countries and outside their countries. The 2.5 % is the obligatory Zakat (alms-giving) in Islam required from all those who have more than their basic requirements for a decent life. If this corner of Islam is fulï¬lled, the problem of poverty, inequality, huge problems in health, and education will gradually be overcome. Let us hope that at least the world population will get clean potable water, at least two nourishing healthy meals per day, good drainage system, child and maternal care which would reduce the infant mortality rate, the 5 years mortality, the stillbirths, the deaths and diseases occurring due to parturition and postpartum, and so forth.

309,422,0.342,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"A food model is a body of knowledge that aggregates multiple experiences in the form of trial and error by a human community. It comes in the form of a series of nested categories that are used daily by members of a society, without real awareness, implicitly taken as âself-evidentâ. This âself-evidentâ character is the main epistemological obstacle to the study of dietary patterns. The sociology of risk poses risk as a ânewâ datum on the scale of history in the development of rationality and probabilistic thinking. For the socioanthropology of food, food anxiety is a âconstantâ phenomenon. It is the role of dietary patterns to maintain the intensity of anxiety at an acceptable level, and to regulate it. Thus, crises appear as a weakening of the devices of regulation and as a consequence of the erosion of food models. The paradigmatic rupture is that anxiety is not the problem, but that âbadâ regulation is. This paradigmatic reversal is similar to that made in the sociology of organisations by Michel Crozier and Erhard Friedberg (1980), when they proposed to regard conflict not as the consequence of an organisational failure, but as constitutive of organisations. Whereas the preceding theoretical currents, Taylorism, or the current of human relations, sought to avoid conflict at all costs, the sociology of organisations postulates that the purpose of management is not about avoiding conflicts, but rather about regulating them. Reading risk in terms of it being a consequence of modernity invites one to seek the conditions of a return to the confidence of a time before crisis. It could also in certain situations support the naÃ¯ve idea of a nostalgic, lost food paradise. The approach whereby anxiety is posed as an invariant suggests a focus on the âdevicesâ of regulation of anxiety that are food models. While the theory of risk hierarchises the risks between vital risks, that is, the health risks on one side, and on the other, the secondary, more âqualitativeâ risks, the perspective of food anxiety gives importance, not only to the health risks, but also to the questions of pleasure, social identities, ethics, human-animal relationshipsâ¦"

Finally, the ecological sensitivity of different areas and âmarine crossroadsâ where incidents are more likely to occur can be comparably easily identified and located. It is, however, more complex to relate these parameters to what we know about the likelihood of human errors. Although clear distinctions between human error on the one hand and technical malfunction on the other can seldom be made, available statistics show that the former tend to still be the most common cause of incidents and accidents (Knudsen and Hassler 2011)."
378,69,0.341,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"To Polanyi, the logical consequences of this were poverty for most workers needing to sell their skills and an overexploitation of nature. Political interventions were frequently necessary to prevent this inbuilt tendency of market systems from destroying its real basis. Social history in the nineteenth century was thus the result of a double movement: the extension of the market organization in respect to genuine commodities was accompanied by its restriction in respect to ï¬ctitious onesâ¦ Society protected itself against the perils inherent in a self-regulating market systemâthis was the one comprehensive feature in the history of the age (Polanyi 1957: 76). The influential nineteenth-century philosophers or economists whom he cites, however, see the origin of the misery precisely in these regulatory efforts. They believed that without public interference and by shedding former organizational patterns, market dynamics and their tendency toward equilibrium would lead to the most efï¬cient allocation of resourcesâfrom which everyone would prosper eventually. Some structural adjustment costs for some groups or ecosystems might"
248,171,0.341,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","overwhelming importance of what I referred to as vastogenic (waste-creating, waste-proï¬ting) systems. The article went on to cover research pointing out that over the 70 years since the end of World War II, a determinable set of political and social initiatives have shaped global corporate food regimes in Europe, the US, and elsewhere into social systems that sit outside the control of all but a few of the most powerful nation-statesâsocial food mobilizing systems that proï¬t from their vastogenic components. Food security (however deï¬ned) is increasingly dependent on the internal structures and processes of a diminishing number of corporate food wholesalers and retailers, plus those controlling the production factor chains of global agriculture such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. Critically, food waste is not just some regrettable side effect of these systems that will be taken care of by technical, regulatory, and organizational ï¬xing; it has become a core component of the way these systems have developedâwaste speeds up the proï¬table through-flow of food and is an increasing part of the proï¬t mechanism. To combat the ofï¬cial and institutional systemic myopia, a shift of global geographical vision is required, away from the productivity and population biases that comprise the current food security discourse, and towards the spatiality and biopolitical aspects of these vastogenic systems (including their social, political and economic embeddedness), what Misselhorn et al. (2012) describe as a food systems approach. Global food production systems for instance do not just passively distribute food from zones of mass food production to an increasingly spatially diverse and growing range of zones of mass food consumption, they are dynamic systems with the agency, power and proï¬t-motive to ceaselessly create new appetites and diets, particularly now amongst the fast-growing consumer classes of South and East Asia. Essentially, the proï¬tability of these systems is built on the gradient between higher priced means of delivery in higher income zones and lower cost methods of production in low-income areasâareas where food insecurity is a substantial issue. That gradient can be made steeper by a contractual dominance over small food producers acting to cheapen production factor costs, and through a range of measures to speed up food waste (and thus turnover) once it exits the doors of the system. It is worth reviewing some of the ï¬gures to illustrate the size of (and increase in) food waste. The EU points out that up to 50 % of the edible food passing through them is wasted by European households, supermarkets, and restaurants each year; a quantity which it is estimated will grow by 40 % by 2020 under current circumstances (European Parliament 2012). In the US 40 % of all food production is wasted, 25 % of which is thrown away by Americans when they get home (Buzby and Hyman 2012)âthe quantity being wasted in the US has also increased by about 50 % since the 1970s from 30 % of the total to 40 % (Hall et al. 2009). Globally, the ï¬gure for overall waste is about one third of all food (Hall et al. 2009; FAO 2011), but food waste is overwhelmingly dominated by consumers in zones of mass food consumption: âConsumers in rich countries waste almost as much food, 222 million tonnes, as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 2011: 5).â In some food categories (seafood, fresh vegetables), the systemic"
169,695,0.341,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"This becomes even more alarming when it is realized just how scarce freshwater ecosystems are in the ï¬rst place, covering for less than 1% of the Earthâs surface. Freshwater conservation has therefore been a priority among environmental NGOs for decades. In fact, many local or national NGOs and initiatives were formed as a direct consequence of too little to no governmental action toward sustainable management of freshwater resources. Many international NGOs, such as WWF, also started to act because of the crucial role water resources play in the context of human development globally. They function as advocates for integration of local, regional, and international water policies, for a proper scienceâpolicy interface, and for adequate stakeholder involvement in decision-making in order to ensure that the needs of both nature and local communities are being met. In the following text, we will present three case studies that illustrate how environmental NGOs can make a difference and what challenges they face."

Long-term benefits relate to improved understanding and awareness of flood risks, more confidence in governmentsâ decisions or capacity building. Overall, benefits can be clustered into four types: â Acceptability and sustainability, in terms of effective implementation of water policy and projects, proper enforcement of regulation, political acceptability and ownership of decision and outcomes â Social equity and cohesion, which is related to trust, confidence and customer satisfaction, as well as corporate social responsibility â Capacity and knowledge development, which emanates from raising greater awareness, sharing information and forming opinions â Economic efficiency, as it can assist in optimising cost saving, value for money and time saving, as well as broader economic benefits related to greater policy coherence and synergies across sectors and projects. Conducting evaluations on the costs and benefits of stakeholder engagement can provide the evidence to effectively guide decision-making and policy/project implementation with tangible data and analyses. Different costs and benefits accrue to different stakeholder groups at different times and require managing trade-offs to ensure successful engagement processes and outcomes. There is a dearth of knowledge on the distributional impacts of stakeholder engagement. The danger is the potentially inequitable distribution of the benefits of engagement. The sustainability of stakeholder engagement will not only depend on the net difference between aggregate costs and benefits, but also on how they are distributed between stakeholders and on stakeholdersâ willingness to bear them. Also, water policy reforms and large projects can induce important adjustment costs, especially in the short term, whilst the benefits of such initiatives may only become visible in the long term. It is crucial to critically reflect upon the ratio of costs and benefits during engagement processes and determine the appropriate trade-offs related to this dual temporality."

With their legal rights (resources), they are also in the position to block the development of the process, at least until a higher level of awareness (cognitions) has been developed (Fig. 6.8). However, after our diagnosis of the intensity of perceptions of local challenges for water use due to the impacts of climate changes, although the role of strong resources in blocking the development of adaptation measures could be considered highly negative, that is just a matter of interpretation. If the answer is âstrongâ, we must recognize that the influence on the dependent variable that the score is very negative. This characteristic of the interaction process can also be highly supportive. Perhaps the story for Vilaine, as also formulated in words, is that all three main factors now have a negative influence on the progress of adaptation. However, when change occurs, most likely a change from cognitions (more awareness), to motivation, such change would have a positive influence on drought adaptation. Thus, the same strong resource position that is now capable of blocking progress would then become a productive position in the development of adaptation measures. As a consequence, relatively rapid change is not impossible and even possible. To represent this possibility, Fig. 6.9 describes the process induced by an improvement of local climate change awareness.

182,357,0.34,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"ANIMALS AS PATHOLOGICAL SPECIMENS The role of pathological specimen was performed after death by many of the animals that feature in this volume. Its frequency reveals how important animal bodies were to the building of pathological knowledgeâ about diseases that afflicted particular animals, the distribution of diseases across the species, and the disease relationships between species. We have seen how animals were transformed into pathological specimens through post-mortem examination. Their organs, tissues and bodily fluids could be observed directly, removed for exhibition to interested parties, preserved for deposition and inspection within museums, or prepared for microscopic examination within laboratories. In existing historical literature, these processes and practices are generally sidelined by, or conflated with, the animalâs role as experimental material. The key exception is in accounts of the state control of certain late nineteenth-century animal diseases. Woods shows that in Britain, policies for the eradication of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and swine fever were predicated on the belief that they could be diagnosed accurately during post-mortem examination. Experience demonstrated that this was not, in fact, the case: Abigail Woods. âfrom Practical Men to Scientific Experts: British Veterinary Surgeons and the Development of Government Scientific Expertise, c.1878â1919.â History of Science li (2013): 457â80. Other authors have explored the diagnosis, in animal pathological specimens, of diseases that spread to humans via meat consumption. Here the animals performed simultaneously as food, a role that is discussed further below. Starting in Germany, and spreading subsequently to other European countries and the USA, specimens of pig muscle were subjected to microscopic inspection to see if they contained the parasitic disease trichinosis, which could cause death to human consumers: J. Gignilliat. âPigs, Politics and Protection: The European Boycott of American Pork, 1879â1891.â Agricultural History 35 (1961): 3â12; J.

36,829,0.34,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Generally, it is a lot easier to attract funding for specific projects and programs than for staff or volunteer compensation, but these projects may be short term and tied to specific areas. Conservation solutions that require long-term monitoring with standardized methodologies (mandatory for statistical inference of success or failure of interventions) often lack âinnovation appealâ to referees and funding organizations. Access to core or unrestricted funding which can be used for key strategic work, or to maintain basic network administration, is hard to secure. BCT has managed to grow its unrestricted income through donations, membership, legacies, and community fundraising, with some success, but this takes time and investment, and can be hard to maintain during periods of economic downturn. Ironically, while lack of protective legislation hampers conservation progress for some networks, protective legislation can lead to negative attitudes toward bats in other areas, particularly during recessions when protection of species can be seen as a barrier to economic growth. In addition, perceived âexaggeratedâ bat protection efforts can lead to reluctance among citizens to admit to the occurrence of bats in their property at all, for fear of losing partial control over their property. In a social network, links between actors are almost entirely based on forms of communication, so mechanisms for communication (from face-to-face to online contact) are critical for the success of a network, particularly when members are geographically dispersed. All the bat conservation networks have a Web presence for interaction and/or issue newsletters, and many have regular face-to-face meetings, but gaps in communication can cause network stress, particular when node diversity is high (i.e., members come from many different backgrounds and perspectives). Effective communication is critical if network members differ in their position on a key issue. For example, tensions between the core actors in BCT and supporters and volunteers in 2006 over BCTâs stance on a government study of rabies in bats generated very strong concerns (Racey et al. 2013). This led to a review and new model of working with volunteers (partner and network agreements, regular meetings and communication) which proved very beneficial."

As previously stated, the assessment phase serves to deï¬ne the management challenge and identify which factors may be involved in its genesis or in any solution(s). How factors are assessed depends both on mental models and goals held by individual stakeholders as well as the model(s) of the problem developed by the group. The process of building a model of the problem that is understandable and acceptable to the group offers a chance to clarify what goals and mental models are being used by individuals. If those are ignored, there is a good chance that efforts to reform policy or encourage the adoption of new innovative policies may be rejected by stakeholders. This highlights the importance of sustaining the learning process long enough to achieve such clariï¬cation. This deeper level of learning, e.g., doubleloop learning, involves probing the decision-making process itself and how social and institutional relations and stakeholder perspectives inï¬uence it (Torbert et al. 2004; Argyris 1976, 2005; Argyris and SchÃ¶n 1978; Williams 2011).

72,76,0.34,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Added to this are individual initiatives and rebellions against prevailing morals, customs, rules â interruptions or crossings of âimitation streamsâ â that are transferred and imitated from person to person, leading to social innovations. âResearching the âmany small inventionsâ, according to Tarde, is a matter for a sociology which âhas become a truly experimental scienceââ (Balke, 2009, p. 151). Social change must be viewed as a contingent phenomenon that resists any general (macro) theory. Because of the basic interdependence between social structures and social negotiation (Joas, 1992, p. 60), in every reproduced action there exists simultaneously the momentum of creation, change and transformation. The benefit of conceptualising a micro foundation of the social realm consists in decoding the recursive processes based on many small social inventions, ideas, initiatives and innovations as drivers of social change. If social micro units are accorded constitutive importance for the dynamics of society, it becomes possible to describe social change not simply as a trend in the sense of a transition from one state at time t to another at time t1, but to see it as an independent non-deterministic reality. Thus, social innovation can be understood as a âstarting point for creating social dynamics behind technological innovationsâ (Geels, 2006, p. 6), that is, as change that arises as a result of constant changes by inventive and imitating actors (Tarde, 2009c, p. 67). With Tarde, social change can be traced back to the effects of small and micro units. Change is explained from the bottom up in current discourse on social transformation processes, as a fundamental prerequisite for substantial change (Paech, 2012). Its emergence from unintended and intentional deviations from the ideal of imitation provides the possibility of linking micro and macro perspectives (Gilgenmann, 2010, p. 7) â connecting a view of individuals in their society with a view of the society as a whole. While the macro perspective looks at how social facts and constructs impact on social life, that is, it refers to the power of structures, institutions etc. to shape actions (see, for example, Hasse and KrÃ¼cken, 2005, p. 17), the micro perspective on the social realm focuses on the âlaw of their formationâ (Tarde, 2009a, p. 101) and discovers how they emerge and transform, that is, it enables a micro foundation of social change. The key to analysis, therefore, lies in identifying social innovations that spread through society as a result of imitation to bring about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). These are non-teleological and highly contingent processes."
118,716,0.34,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"21.6 Discussing the Fukushima Daiichi Catastrophe Other chapters in this book convey the experience of planning and hosting the summer school. The week in August 2011 was eye-opening in so many ways. The students showed an unusual willingness to play along with an experiment that went against much of their previous training. Social scientists are used to deeply unresolvable problems; in fact, we often take pleasure (at least the academics among us) in societal complexity and the absence of a single right answer. Our summer school attendees remarked on their bewilderment: how to chart a course through the thicket of conflicting perspectives and options. To my mind, the most compelling parts of the summer school were not about contentâthe lectures by experts, the formulation of problems to be tackled, or even the conclusions that the student teams articulated on the last day. What was most impressive was the process, how it all unfolded. The organizers and discussion leaders managed to make space for future engineers to speak analytically and non-defensively about the failures that led into the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. It was not out of line to talk about the ânuclear villageââand also to subject that concept to some pretty stringent critique. Some students found a voice to speak from their own experience in ways that I doubt they would have tried in a regular NE classroom. Several said that whatever the caveats attached to formal projections of risk, they had never believed that an accident of this sort could actually happen. And now that it had happened, it could happen again. It also took deliberate social engineering to make room for open-ended discussions. Along with turning off the video camera (documenting for the purpose of Japanese reporting to funders) and a no-powerpoint rule for final presentations, it made a difference that we were in a setting outside the classrooms in Etcheverry, in downtown Berkeley, near several bars. It is tempting to live out of the inspiration of the summer school and to present it in the reporting language of demonstrated success. And yet I do not think of it as a straight-ahead model for future educational programs, at least not in this oneshot form. Asking the students to do little preparation, in a week of lectures and Q&A we could only get so far. When we made our way past the initial technical presentations to take up societal issues, it was not clear that social scientists were seen as having anything different to offer from engineers speaking in the same vein. And in the student discussions, inevitably, the content of âsocial scienceâ"
282,216,0.34,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"sometimes indistinguishable from other âgoodâ management practices, such as consultations, either with external parties or internally with employees, or simply coordination of activities across an organizationâ (Rodal and Mulder, 1993, pp. 27â8). Even when focusing only on UN partnerships, Carmen Malena notes that âReviewing the literature and talking to UN and civil society representatives quickly reveals that there is little common understanding regarding the meaning of partnershipâ (Malena, 2004). 4. The âideal typeâ as a method for defining social scientific concepts is commonly ascribed to Max Weber. Social reality is usually so complex and varied that no conceptual apparatus can do it justice. Nevertheless, Weber argued, social scientists should define clear concepts that try to capture important similarities of phenomena and thus facilitate analysis and enquiry. Cf. for example, KÃ¤sler (1995), pp. 229â34. 5. Cf. the so-called Bali guiding principles (available at http://www.un.org/esa/ sustdev/partnerships/bali_guiding_principles.htm, last accessed 27 August 2009) and the CSD 11 decision (Commission on Sustainable Development, 2003). 6. âUnter âPublic Private Partnershipsâ verstehen wir Entwicklungspartnerschaften mit der Privatwirtschaft: Die Partnerschaften bestehen aus gemeinsam finanzierten Projekten von Unternehmen und entwicklungspolitischen Institutionenâ (Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Technische Zusammenarbeit, 2004). 7. The concept of corporatism has changed over time, sometimes creating confusion as to its exact meaning. Williamson (1985b), for example, provides a comprehensive discussion of the concept of corporatism and distinguishes three different usages of the term as a body of prescriptive economic and social thought, as a practice of a range of authoritarian regimes and as an analytical tool to examine the relations between organised groups and the state in liberal democracies. 8. Philippe S. Schmitter, a leading contemporary theorist on corporatism, for example, reflects the ambiguous connotations of the term when he states that âCorporatism, either as a practice in political life or as a concept in political theory, has always been politically controversial. It has been heralded as a novel and promising way of ensuring harmony between conflicting social classes. It has also been condemned as a reactionary and antidemocratic formula for suppressing the demands of autonomous associations and movementsâ (Schmitter, 1995, p. 309). 9. This argument has been made most explicitly for partnerships operating at the international or transnational level by Marina Ottaway. To her, recent trends suggest that corporatist solutions at the global level are on the rise. Analysing the historical track record of corporatism, she comes to the conclusion that the main danger of corporatism as implemented in nation states, namely the emergence of authoritarianism, is not a risk at the global level. Yet she still concludes that corporatismâs costs exceed it benefits: âAnd this is what corporatism has always done: it absorbs groups that challenge the status quo in the political system, where they can have some impact on policy reform but are neutralized as vehicles for radical changeâ (Ottaway, 2001, p. 280). For the local level, Vivien Lowndes has emphasised that partnerships have the same shortcomings as the traditional corporatist model. Cf. Lowndes (2001). 10. Cf. Saul (1999). 11. The argument has been made most powerfully for NGOs operating at the transnational or international level. Thus, for example, Anderson and Rieff criticise the standard account of transnational NGOs as constituting âglobal civil societyâ and"

347,291,0.339,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"how to safely perform ballast water exchange before entering the Baltic Sea, as well as provide guidance on how to perform risk assessments and monitoring. Various research projects and databases have been initiated at the European and Baltic Sea level to compile inventories of IAS, as well as identify species and shipping practices connected with particularly high levels of environmental risks (HELCOM 2014; Smolarz et al. 2016). Hence, both management and assessment activities linked to IAS risks in the Baltic Sea are, despite some recent progress, still in need of further development, particularly in order to reach the ambitious objective set by HELCOM in the 2007 Baltic Sea Action Plan of no introduction of IAS from ships. For example, observations of new IAS often still build on incidental reporting, since targeted and coordinated monitoring is often lacking in high-risk areas. In a wider perspective, it has also been argued that management and science support needs to be improved for ânon-shippingâ sources of IAS such as aquaculture and that interdependence with other environmental issues such as fisheries, human-induced climate change and eutrophication need to be considered in risk assessments (Smolarz et al. 2016). Wide stakeholder involvement at the science-policy interface is lacking in the case of IAS. For most stakeholders and the general public, this seems to be due to a widespread lack of interest in the IAS issue and its management, which are seen as rather uncontroversial and straightforward. In contrast, stakeholders associated with the shipping and cargo sector have shown a strong interest in contributing knowledge and opinions as part of negotiations on development and implementation of regulations (Lemke et al. 2010). Negotiations leading up to the 2004 opening of the BWM Convention have been described by IMO as âcomplexâ. The subsequent rather long ratification process seems to have been influenced by discussions on, for example, technical possibilities and costs of ballast water management. It therefore remains to be seen whether or not these sector-based discussions will improve efficiency and effectiveness of IAS-related management in the Baltic Sea."
97,4,0.339,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Today, we are facing increasing challenges from climate change and urbanization. Already, half of the earthâs population lives in urban areas, and projections suggest that this share will increase up to 66% by mid of this century. This urban expansion will heavily draw on natural resources, including open space, and will have severe effects on ecosystems and the services they provide. Cities are the first to experience impacts from climate change. Rising temperatures, heat waves, extreme precipitation events, flooding and droughts are causing economic losses, social insecurity and affecting health and human well-being. Traditionally, urban planners and practitioners in land and resource management have relied on conventional engineering solutions to adapt to climate change, but this may not always be cost-effective, sufficient or sustainable. Nature-based solutions can address societal challenges from climate change and urbanization in a sustainable way. By using ecosystem services, nature-based solutions are innovative solutions that use natural elements to achieve environmental and societal goals. They offer significant potential to provide energy and resource-efficient responses to climate change, and to enhance our natural capital. Nature-based solutions provide additional multiple benefits to city residents such as improvements in health and wellbeing, and improvements of the local green economy. This volume brings together a wealth of knowledge on the effectiveness of nature-based solutions in addressing climate change adaptation from diverse but inter-related fields of study. Importantly, research from the natural and social sciences is combined and results are interlinked with urban governance and local participation. This volume clearly demonstrates the importance of taking a systemic approach to combine knowledge from different fields, such as urban planning, nature conservation, urban engineering, governance or social justice and public health to address complex issues in a sustainable way. This integrated view to sustainable urban development is also emphasized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the New Urban Agenda adopted at the United Nationsâ HABITAT III conference, and supported by the European Commissionâs research and innovation policy on nature-based solutions. It is now time to seize opportunities to act. By understanding the value of nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation for"
73,555,0.339,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Abstract The dominant mode of feeding Australian cities is the industrial food system, including industrial agriculture. This food system has produced crises in public health in the form of rising incidence of non-communicable disease linked to diet; and crises in environmental health ï¬owing from industrial agriculture and the food processing and distribution network. This chapter discusses the urban agriculture program implemented in Cuba in the mid-1990s âSpecial Periodâ in response to a food security crisis, as an example of legal change in response to food system failure. The Cuban experience is analysed by drawing on Blomleyâs work on legal geography methodological tools of performativity, and pragmatism (speciï¬cally Deweyâs writings on âhabitâ). It is concluded that changes to the law and policy underpinning Australiaâs dysfunctional urban food system might be catalysed by framing and communicating the health and ecological problems in the language of crisis, and by responding to this food system crisis by experimenting with alternatives such as urban agriculture.

178,21,0.339,Ethics Dumping : Case Studies From North-South Research Collaborations,"Vulnerable Populations âSocial Science Research in a Humanitarian Emergency Contextâ, by GwenaÃ«lle Luc and Chiara Altare, describes conflicts for an international NGO in an African village. The community felt betrayed when unexpected ï¬ndings about health-seeking behaviours that revealed illegal female genital mutilation (FGM) were shared publicly and contributed to cultural stigmatization. The NGO performed a dual role as assistance provider and researcher, which endangered the neutrality of the data collection and, in the end, the acceptability of its assistance. Roger Chennells and Andries Steenkamp criticize an international research project, which aimed to examine the genetic structure of âindigenous hunter-gatherer peoplesâ from Namibia and compare the results with âBantu from southern Africaâ. A supplementary document published with the study contained conclusions and details that the San regarded as pejorative and discriminatory; âInternational Genomics Research Involving the San Peopleâ details the perceived exploitation and the San response. In âSex Workers Involved in HIV/AIDS Researchâ, Anthony Tukai tells the personal story of supporting a vulnerable and stigmatized population in a Nairobi slum. In a demonstration of good practice, the case outlines empowerment mechanisms that reduced the potential for exploitation. In âCervical Cancer Screening Trials on Poor and Illiterate Women in Indiaâ, Sandhya Srinivasan, Veena Johari and Amar Jesani describe three internationally funded clinical trials that took place between 1998 and 2015 to determine whether primary healthcare workers could conduct cervical cancer screening using cheap visual inspection. These non-drug trials did not require regulatory permission, and the existing standard of care was misconstrued. According to the authors, known and effective methods of cervical cancer screening (by Pap smear) were withheld from 141,000 women even though they have represented the standard of care in India since the 1970s. Two hundred and ï¬fty-four women in the no-screening arm died from cervical cancer."
260,75,0.339,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"The commercial trade of ranavirus hosts is likely a significant factor facilitating the global distribution of ranaviruses, as well as interclass transmission of the pathogen. If novel strains of ranaviruses are introduced into naÃ¯ve populations, experimental evidence suggests that there could be devastating effects (e.g., Pearman et al. 2004; Storfer et al. 2007; Hoverman et al. 2010). With the trade in animals being truly global and ranaviruses accompanying them (e.g., Schloegel et al. 2009; Kolby et al. 2014), it is important to understand what ranaviruses are being transported and where they end up. Understanding the geographical distribution and host range of ranaviruses is becoming increasingly important as the World Health Organization for Animals has declared that EHNV and ranaviruses that infect amphibians are âreportable infections of wildlifeâ (OIE 2008). This designation requires countries that have agreed to OIE policies to screen a sample of ranavirus hosts that are crossing international borders for the presence of ranaviruses (Schloegel et al. 2010). However, few countries have yet taken steps to implement import policies that require declaration of ranavirus-free animals. Moreover, infection of fish by ranaviruses (other than EHNV) and reptiles (for any ranavirus species) are not included in the OIE regulations. We are just beginning to understand the distribution and host range of ranaviruses. Continued surveillance of wild and captive populations, as well as, commercially traded animals combined with the characterization of the ranavirus strains are necessary to fully understand the distribution and host diversity of ranaviruses. Therefore, when ranavirus studies are undertaken, sufficient funding should be obtained to at least partially characterize the virus if detected. This approach will require that researchers work in interdisciplinary groups. Acknowledgments Funding has been provided by a Presidentâs Initiative Faculty Development Grant Type A to ALJD.

The Web 2.0, a buzzword comprising of phenomena such as blogs and social networks, is shaping not just communication, but also decision-making in communities ranging from Parliamentarians to CEOs, and from TV staff to newspaper editors. The scientific community has not felt the same amount of pressure. Nevertheless, a few scientists have taken the lead: Science blogs are increasingly popular and scientists tweet and interact with a larger audience. Universities have opened pages on Facebook and other social networks, or have created internal networks for communication. We have even witnessed the rise of social networks that exclusively address scientists (see Academia Goes Facebook? The Potential of Social Network Sites in the Scholarly Realm). A silent revolution is on its way with more and more students entering the ivory tower of academia with a set of communication expectations based on real-time communication across borders, cultures, and scientific clubs. The ivory tower opened up some windows which are now being showcased as Science 2.0. Meanwhile, a second silent revolution has been taking place. In 2002, the Soros-founded Budapest Open Access Initiative1 called for more publications along their principles. Ten years later, Open Access has spread to a plethora of scientific communities, publishers and journals (BjoÌrk et al. 2010; Laakso et al. 2011; Laakso & BjoÌrk 2012). The more common Open Access has become, the more people start to think about what other sorts of scientific information might be available openly. As is the case with Open Access, for many initiatives striving for Openness in the context of scientific information it is quite unclear what kind of Openness they are claiming or how they define Openness. Some Open Access advocates are satisfied if scientific publications are available online and free of charge (so called Gratis Open Access) while others want these publications to be made available according the principles of the Open Definition,2 that applies the Open Source paradigm to any sort of knowledge or information, including the rights to access, reuse, and redistribute it. Considering the Open Science concepts as an umbrella, there are several initiatives (see Herb 2012) that want to open up nearly every component or single item within research and scientific workflows, e.g.: â¢ Open Review, which includes both review of funding proposals and articles that are submitted for publication, the latter traditionally conducted as a peer review. Open Review does not so much aim for Openness according to the Open"

229,21,0.339,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"Holistic understandings of the early modern body thus clearly influenced the experience and treatment of illness at a basic level. As Chapter 4 of this book details, they also contributed to the tendency to compare natural with politic bodies, and vice versa, a phenomenon which has been described in various permutations by medical, cultural and literary historians.35 Among the products of the âbodily turnâ in early modern studies have been a number of works focussing on specific illnesses, which often foreground the twinned physical and social ramifications of a particular disease. Venereal pox and plague have proven particularly fruitful topics for such investigations, with numerous authors showing how those diseases interacted with contemporary concerns about personal morality, national security and self-sufficiency.36 Perhaps because it appears much less frequently in the primary literature, no such interdisciplinary study has been conducted of cancer in the early modern period. Indeed, while the politics and semiotics of cancer have been much studied, these studies overwhelmingly focus on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, often from an activist standpoint. Texts such as The Breast Cancer Wars and âThe body in breast cancerâ, for instance, have shown how militaristic metaphors popularised in the mid-twentieth century continue to influence clinical research and decision-making around breast cancer.37 Furthermore, cancer is, for many such studies, a feminist issue, with diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer in particular reflecting the âpinkwashingâ dominance of heteronormative models of femininity.38 In the related genre of cancer âbiographiesâ, the recent past is equally, and understandably, emphasised. Several of the most incisive studies of the cultural and social history of cancer have concentrated on the twentieth century, and while they acknowledge the âatavisticâ presence of premodern beliefs about cancer in those narratives, these older beliefs are cast as static, homogenous and characterised by shame and fear.39 Texts such as Siddhartha Mukherjeeâs popular The Emperor of All Maladies, James S. Olsonâs Bathshebaâs Breast or George Johnsonâs recent The Cancer Chronicles offer a broader historical sweep, but nonetheless devote the vast majority of their pages to detailing the development of therapies in the past 200 years, an era of relatively rapid development in the understanding of cancers.40 In many readings, therefore, cancer has been framed as a postindustrial disease, suddenly emerging as a major cause of death during the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, scholarship on cancer which traces the disease into pre- or early modernity has generally accepted that the disease is an ancient one, with textual evidence of âcancersâ dating back well over a millennium. A brief 2004 study by A. Kaprozilos and N. Pavlidis, for example, details treatments for the disease from the third-century BC"

[My University] now has [an] initiative that studies tech and society, for example. You need a human perspective around scientific innovations and their applications. As4: Natural sciences create technologies and social sciences propose various policies, but it is only humanities who can tell us how they can be used wisely. As16: Philosophy helps us foresee the impact of new technologies (or gives us the tools to do so). Challenging social norms Humanities research can often be the source of challenges to widely accepted social values and traditions. In this way it may actually be in tension with social cohesion. This role overlaps with critical thinking, being a specific instance of it, so we shall have more to say below. But for the moment, here is one of our interviewees testifying to the critical value of the humanities in a social context: As2: I would just say that it is only in the humanities and social sciences that we still produce a âcritical discourseâ. Science, technology and even economics have stopped performing that function. The curricula in these areas have no element of criticism per se, making it difficult for them to contribute to the formation of critical citizenship. It has proved more than once in the course of the last century that pure science and economics have failed to produce an understanding of the symbolic life that makes us social and therefore human. This point was also stressed at our Latin American workshop. Institution building Finally, it is worth recording three interview responses (from India, Lebanon and Russia) that linked the humanities to the creation and nurturing of strong institutions: ME3: The humanities are essential for building strong institutions.

Uncertainty is perhaps the dominant focus. Uncertainty is present in many forms. As we have discussed, uncertainty can be related directly to initial observations (initial condition uncertainty), to the physical climate model (structural uncertainty), and to future emissions (scenario uncertainty). There is also uncertainty from observations used in evaluation (usually a part of structural or model uncertainty). There is another class of uncertainty about the impacts of the resulting climate projections on the anthroposphere. Impacts of climate change on human systems include impacts on agriculture, built infrastructure, and ecosystems. These impacts are often highly dependent on the local facts and details, including policy and management practices that are in place. There is uncertainty associated with the response of people. The response is often discussed in terms of changes to technology and future energy systems to reduce emissions. This is called mitigation. However, on a local scale, there are decisions about land use, policy, management,"

169,620,0.338,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Originating in the 1970s, the ES concept became an issue in the international environmental discussions in the 1990s. Since then its inï¬uence has continued to rise. An important milestone was Robert Costanzaâs publication on the value of worldâs natural capital and ES that calculated the total value of worldâs ES with $16â$54 trillion per year (Costanza et al. 1997). A more recent publication by Costanza et al. (2014) gives an updated estimate for the total global ES in 2011 of $125 trillion per year. Other important steps were the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2003) that assessed the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being, the TEEB initiative (TEEB 2010) that highlighted the global economic beneï¬ts of biodiversity, and the establishment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2015) that acts as an interface between scientists and policy-makers. Furthermore, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2010) has a strong focus on ES and includes this issue as one of its strategic goals. A comprehensive review on the history of the ES concept is given by GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. (2010). In the ï¬eld of landscape planning, the ES approach is comparable with the idea of âlandscape functionalityâ that has already been an issue for decades (Kienast 2010; Von Haaren and Albert 2011; Grunewald and Bastian 2013). Although this concept overlaps to a certain extent with the understanding of ES, many open questions remain before the ES concept is fully integrated in landscape research and decisionmaking (Hermann et al. 2014). Depending on the research question and the context, there are different ways to categorize ES. An overview of these different classiï¬cations is given by, e.g., HÃ¤yhÃ¤ and Franzese (2014). The most commonly used classiï¬cation was developed in the frame of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2003) that divided ES into four categories: supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services.

36,838,0.338,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Finally, a global network would provide a means for current and emergent critical issues to become widely known and, critically, could act as a single voice to promote bat conservation through global positions on recurrent, widespread issues such as wind installations, habitat loss and the protection of critical sites, EIDs. A unified voice and global position could also be key in local or national issues where governments, resilient to the dogged efforts of the local group, might be swayed by unified international scrutiny or outrage. Many of the regional networks have faced such challenges. For example, in Australia, the ABS is in urgent need of support to keep up with the number and scale of political issues and administrative actions surrounding flying foxes, and it is conceivable that unified global advocacy might have prompted earlier, precautionary, action as the Christmas Island Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi) declined to (presumed) extinction. Some suggestion that international opinion can influence local decisions comes from Mauritius. In 2006, the prime minister of Mauritius was heavily lobbied by British conservationists to void a cull of Pteropus niger, planned to placate fruit farmers. The lobbyistsâ influence is uncertain as the cull went ahead, but its success was limited by existing, observed, legislation precluding the discharge of firearms after dark. We believe a global network can play a key role in bat conservation in the coming decades. However, it must retain the personality of each regional network and promote local bat conservation. Based on the effectiveness of polycentric diverse networks outlined above (Sect. 17.3.2), we envisage a global network as a metanetwork of regional networks (Table 17.1) linked by bridging ties among members to generate an emergent, but decentralized global network of networks. To reach this end requires that existing regional networks be supported and strengthened, the establishment of new networks in areas of the world currently not covered, and the development of bridging links across regional networks to provide global coverage."

149,11,0.338,Sago Palm : Multiple Contributions To Food Security and Sustainable Livelihoods,"Abstract The United Nations (FAO) projected that global food production needs to be increased by 60% by 2050 to meet increasing world demands as a result of rapid population growth and per capita food consumption increase. However, there is a very little room to expand agricultural land, while water scarcity is threatening future agricultural production potential. Under the circumstances, it is predicted that nearly 90% of the food production increase should come from existing arable land through yield increase and advancement of agricultural research and innovation. On the other hand, the world is facing other serious challenges and uncertainties resulting from the stagnation of productivity growth of major cereal crops, advancement of negative impacts of climate change, and competition on the use of agricultural land and water with bioenergy crops. It is uncertain if and whether the world can meet the challenging target by 2050. Otherwise, the world food security, peace, and stability would be seriously threatened. The situation sparked scientific interest in identifying alternative food resources, which can be grown on underutilized lands without or with less competition with existing food crops, tolerant to stress environmental conditions, and produce a substantial quantity of food or starch. FAO recognized that neglected and underutilized species play a crucial role in the fight against hunger and are a key resource for agriculture and rural development for the benefit of smallholder farmers. In addition, many neglected and underutilized species play a role in keeping cultural diversity alive. They occupy important niches, conserving traditional landscape, adapted to the risky and fragile conditions of rural communities. Against this backdrop, sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.) was identified as one of the most promising typical underutilized food crops with very little attention and research in the past. It can be grown in underutilized wetlands and peat swamps where other food crops cannot grow economically. It produces a high yield of edible starch (about 150â300 kg of dry starch per plant), while different parts of the palm H.

Adaptation is defined by the IPCC fourth assessment report as âthe adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effectsâ (IPCC 2007). This implies a permanent change in the livelihood system leading to better risk-management or coping capacity in the long-run (Smit and Wandel 2006). Diversification at household, village, landscape and national levels is one of the ways of adapting to the changes in climatic patterns and thus of building resilience to climate change, hence it is frequently mentioned in the international CSA policy discourse (FAO 2010;"
92,164,0.338,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Recognizing the value of understanding the interconnectedness and interactions of global health, the PINGH structure facilitates approaches for developing and fostering institutional relationships and collaborative research agendas. Although most projects were developed within the context of a PINGH meeting, they all expanded to reach out to global partners who may or may not have been at meetings. The goal is to create a project or research agenda that focused on an idea or universal health need. Conversations which formed the basis of these projects seemed to be done with the disposition of including multiple voices and perspectives. Participants and organizers approached their project with a sense of urgency and an understanding of their potential role in creating awareness of challenges that exist within areas of global health such as data collection methods, transparency of data, or improving the understanding in an evidence based material. Additional features of these projects leaned towards the role and importance of faculty in fostering global educational experiences for students, challenging the status quo of student learning beyond the traditional Western models of thinking and learning, and developing bilateral partnerships between students and emerging and experienced faculty. The framework of PINGH enabled faculty and staff to consider conceptual frameworks that pressed learning environments to take place in both the Global North and South. Feasibility and specifications of learning sites and the relationship between these sites and selected social and global health trends aided in fostering these relations between countries. The inclusion of the north-south connection was not without challenges such as language barriers or understanding of cultural values and norms that impacted healthcare systems. But at the very least, participants were exposed to a different way of being and were able to co-construct knowledge with a diverse set of colleagues who held different sets of ideologies and systems. The merit of these relationships was due to actions and behaviors that supported the engagement of individuals across and within various institutions and countries. Most notable were: 1.

341,143,0.337,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Abstract Urban governance is as much about infrastructure as it is about people and processes. In particular, the history of urban governance is closely intertwined with the history of urban water services. Historically, as urban areas became larger and more densely inhabited, the collective need for better water services (drinking water, sanitation and flood protection in particular) became overwhelming. Cities simply could not grow beyond a certain relatively modest size without the simultaneous articulation of an integrated water services infrastructure to replace the piecemeal local arrangements previously in place. This necessarily implied new and more complex governance arrangements, in this case the institutionalisation of water services management in functional departmental structures, linked to political decision-making, finance, quality assurance and related functions. Whilst other papers have presented case studies of the urban hydrosocial transition (UHT) in terms of the physical extension of water services (e.g. water supply, sanitation and surface water management), this chapter focuses specifically on urban governance of water. We argue that the progressive breakdown of Fordist neo-corporatism in water services has opened up the field to a proliferation of âglocalâ (to use Swyngedouwâs useful neologism) governance arrangements. Whilst integrated water resource management (IWRM) principles imply a supra-urban scale of governance, the fact that urbanisation brings with it local concentration of water-related impacts means that there is an ineluctable local and urban dimension to water governance. It is therefore not surprising that cities around the world are asserting themselves as central players in water governance. Brief case studies from around the world are presented by way of illustration. Keywords Cities â¢ Water services â¢ Urban hydrosocial transition â¢ Governance"

In the next 10 to 20 years, estimates predict a dramatic increase in the prevalence of NCDs, which will account for nearly 40% of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 (Olesen and Parker 2012). This already has consequences for the current R&I collaborationânot just in 10 or 20 years from now. In this context, AfricaâEU collaboration will require additional research investments to prevent NCDs through new vaccines, diagnostics and treatment, and to improve and increase access to health facilities and health coverage. To better understand AfricaâEurope science cooperation patterns in health research, CAAST-Net Plus conducted a bibliometric study on health co-publications between Sub-Saharan African and European researchers in recent years.2 Bibliometric assessments of joint research in health have already been conducted, for example by Breugelmans et al. (2014, 2015) who compared research publications on PRNDs. Both of these studies found an overall increase in the volume of collaborative research outputs, similar patterns in geographic differences and an overall emphasis on PRDs. However, there have been no comparative analyses of the current research areas in AfricaâEurope collaboration. The study conducted by CAAST-Net Plus analyses the volume of publications on HIV, malaria and TB, collectively here called poverty-related diseases (PRDs), as well as on NDs and on NCDs in bilateral cooperation between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).3 The data was analysed according to the three health research specialisations, defined by keyword sets.4 Figure 6.1 shows the development of the three strands of health research specialisations over the last decade. While the overall number of EUâSSA co-publications in health increased steadily (from slightly more than 2000 in 2005 to almost 5500 in 2014), the relative proportion of publications on NCDs, PRDs and NDs changed: publications on ND and NCD grew while fewer publications on PRD were published, although they still constitute the strongest research strand in comparison to the other two. The increased attention given to NCDs is all the more positive as they have long been ignored although their burden might soon be higher than that of infection diseases. Yet, NCDs are still not a priority, as the number of publications on PRDs has been growing much faster than on NCDs. In fact, African research institutions do not participate fully enough in research on NCDs, as in PRDs or NDs. Several calls to fund research on NCDs have been recently issued by African institutions; for example, the"

222,57,0.337,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"It is well established that ecosystem services provide benefits to society in terms of well-being, but less clear how those benefits are distributed in society. A key issue, not least in delta settings, is whether ecosystem services have greater importance for populations with low levels of wellbeing, and whether ecosystem services and their provision can represent a pathway out of poverty. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment proposed that ecosystems bring benefits through maintaining and enhancing the health of people, through life-sustaining goods and services, and through options for use that represent opportunities for development in material and non-material ways. Beyond direct economic use of ecosystem services, benefits include impacts on health through pathways such as nutrition, clean air and clean water, but also psychological well-being. Further elements of well-being can include positive associations with place and identity in constructing meaning and purpose in life and how ecosystems ameliorate risk, providing a safety net and refuge."

Just as residents in the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius have ignored incentives to relocate, people living in flood plains who make decisions about insurance based on their personal experience with floodsâa rare eventâhave tended to turn down even federally subsidized flood insurance (Kunreuther, 1984). At the same time, experiencing a rare, but highly consequential, event in reality can also have a lasting psychological impact. This possibility brings the discussion full circle. Generations growing up in a period of low stock returns appear to take an unusually cautious approach to investing, even decades later. In other words, young people who experienced the dramatic economic slump of 2008â2009 may enter the stock and housing market much more cautiously than their parents did."

Two important observations can be made about black swans. First, a black swan cannot be described by any of the stakeholders because the event is completely unknown to all of them. Second, while a black swan is a total surprise to all the stakeholders considered, there may be other individuals outside the group of stakeholders for which the event is not a big surprise. As an example, while the economic crisis of 2007/2008 came as a huge surprise to most people, a few individuals, including Taleb [9], foresaw the crisis, even though they could not say when the crisis would occur or exactly how serious the consequences would be. A gray swan is a metaphor for rare global behavior with a large negative impact that is somewhat predictable but typically overlooked by most of the stakeholders considered. It is the âknown unknown,â a rare event that some know is possible but no one knows when or whether it will occur. Because a gray swan is not a complete surprise to all stakeholders, it tends to have less impact than a black swan. However, its impact is still huge. For simplicity, we often neglect to define a set of stakeholders when we discuss gray and black swans. However, the reader should assume that users, owners, software developers, operators, and regulatory government agencies are always among the stakeholders."

This level of analysis has supported our ability to design very practical evidence-based interventions. This concept of bounded rationality (in the economic model) is perhaps far more relevant than the architects of these papers anticipated. One of the limitations of the papers, perhaps reï¬ecting the level of abstraction, is the lack of attention to conï¬ict and power: the possibility of multiple realities and parallel organisational cultures. Corruption is systemic in Uganda especially within the public sector; it can be described as a culture. It is pervasive and starts from the very top of organisations and the systems within which they are based and operates through powerful, organised syndicates. Health workers (and patients) are acutely aware of its existence, the personal beneï¬ts that derive from it and the profound risks associated with challenging it. It is interesting to note the reference by MuÃ±oz et al. to the entrepreneur as a âdestabilising agentâ (2011: 199). âDestabilisingâ in this context could imply creative disruption triggering innovation (in the right direction). Alternatively, or simultaneously, it could refer to the impact of corruption. This detailed (tacit and explicit) knowledge of how corruption works at every level and in every decision necessarily shapes both imagined realities and action plans. In this sense, there may be two parallel systems operating in marked tension with each other within a health facility or authority. Chapter 3 has discussed the impact of corruption on professional volunteers and their relationships with Uganda health workers identifying the dynamics of power and hierarchy (positionalities). None of the theories reviewed pays explicit attention to these dimensions of context. Interestingly it is often the lack of knowledge on the part of foreign agencies and individual volunteers rather than their superior clinical knowledge that limits impact and generates unintended consequences.23 Of course, corruption pollutes not only organisations but also the wider system that nurtures it, fundamentally weakening a sense of identity with the state at national or local level and also with âleadersâ (at every level). Whilst we can identify closely with the concept of âaction planningâ as a vehicle for the exercise of individual agency based on the recombination of disparate knowledges, we have some concerns that the emphasis in the material reviewed, perhaps reï¬ecting the business/private sector context, fails to explain inaction or stasis. Or, situations when human action, qua rational, as MuÃ±oz and Encinar (2014a: 75) put it, could amount to non-decisions or inaction. On a practical level, it may prove impossible to imagine returns on an investment (in training, for example,"

Of course, the socioeconomic context of vulnerability is addressed together with the environmental context, but questions remain about whether current behaviors of community members are supportive of desired biophysical adaptation outcomes.

284,379,0.337,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Social movements opposing mining activities claim that developing mining activities jeopardizes local (and supralocal) livelihoods. Communities in Peru, Guatemala, Colombia and Ecuador signal the risks to their livelihoods, which are dependent on agriculture, cattle and forests. Concerns about health also appear, with high relevance in Esquel (Argentina) regarding cyanide use. Worries about water quality, and availability for local economic activities and household use, are common to all studied cases. While the affected communities signal such concerns as grounds to redraft or even stop a mining project and national mining plans, governments and companies claim that these decisions are not for local communities to make. Central governments argue that mining is an issue of national interest and experts within a national decision-making process should have the last word. Governments and mining companies frame local alarm as an exaggeration that undermines the positive impacts of mining. Moreover, critical communitiesâ and EJMâs views are being labelled by Latin American national governments as irrational, ignorant, anti-development, politically driven, promoted by foreignersâ interests or by a radical, subversive environmentalism (Bebbington, 2012b), hand in hand with criminalization processes (OCMAL, 2011). Ofï¬cial participation arenas become frustrating spaces given the partial information that is shared and the powerless participation modes they offer (Cole and Foster, 2001). As decision-making procedures are unable to address local communitiesâ concerns, disputes form around these procedures and their decisions (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Suryanata and Umemoto, 2005; Walter and MartinezAlier, 2010; Urkidi and Walter, 2011). It is becoming increasingly common for EJMs to prevent or boycott public audiences, as these are seen as an empty requisite for project approval (Jahncke Benavente and Meza, 2010). There were cases of boycotts of public audiences in Tambogrande, Toquepala, TÃ­a MarÃ­a, Esquel and Loncopue. Indigenous communities rejected and misrecognized the alleged consultation processes led by mining companies and governments in Peru, Colombia and Guatemala. In Ecuador and Argentina, indigenous communities claimed that formal consultation never occurred (Urkidi and Walter, 2011; PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). Furthermore, one of the ï¬ndings of this research has been the role played by violence in the fostering of consultations. Human Rights claims have been identiï¬ed as a particular root of Latin American EJMs (Carruthers, 2008). Mining referenda have emerged in contexts of repression and criminalization of activists, where concerns regarding the physical and psychological integrity of activists were rising. In this"

This chapter concludes with policy guidance to decision-makers and practitioners in the form of overarching principles on how to set up the appropriate framework conditions for inclusive water governance. Evidence presented in this chapter demonstrates that decision-makers who adopt a systemic, inclusive approach to water governance are likely to get a better return on the time and resources they invest. They will also be better equipped to handle stakeholder issues and risks more effectively. For engagement processes to be relevant, a careful balance is required between what they try to achieve, the resources they require and whether they succeed in reaching the intended objectives. Decision-makers at all levels have a critical role to play in establishing the enabling environment for result-oriented, effective and impactful stakeholder engagement. Although engagement processes cannot be easily replicated from one context to another, the OECD proposes six principles for creating the necessary conditions for inclusive water governance. Anton Earle defines transboundary watercourses, including rivers, lakes and aquifers (confined and unconfined), shared between two or more countries that are home to over 70 % of the worldâs population and supply water for roughly 60 % of the global food production. It is no surprise that the management of these watercourses has been entrusted to national states, which have the power to make sovereign decisions over their management, use and conservation. State sovereignty is mitigated through the existence of a global institutional framework comprised of customary international water law (the norms dictating how states behave), global and regional conventions, basin-level agreements and basin management organisations. The good news is that there is a large body of joint institutions between countries with transboundary watercourses, the UN estimating that around 3 600 exist. This in part explains the relative lack of military interstate conflicts. Less good news is that despite the existence of international and basin-level agreements and basin organisations, the benefits to be expected from international cooperation around transboundary watercourses have in most cases not materialised. Acute, persistent and seemingly intractable problems persist, with ecosystem degradation not being reversed, joint investments in water infrastructure not materialising and joint management organisations failing to attract significant long-term support from the respective basin states. Despite at least two decades of concerted support by the international development community, the impacts of enhanced interstate cooperation are noticeable through their absence. This chapter investigates why this may be so and introduces a starting point which moves beyond the state-centric approach to transboundary water management. In doing so it does not challenge the sovereign right of states to manage their watercourses; instead it shows how a range of non-state actors do in fact influence state practice through a variety of mechanisms. As these mechanisms are frequently covert, it becomes difficult to assess the integrity of the relationships between actors, in turn making public engagement and participation difficult. Needed is a governance paradigm which opens the decision-making arena to non-state actors all in support of the national governments and their respective mandates. This chapter ends with an indication of what such a governance arrangement might look like"
97,528,0.337,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Climate change and urbanisation are amongst the greatest global challenges society is facing today. The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) has recently been highlighted as key concept in policy and management in achieving alignment of environmental and societal goals (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016; Kabisch et al. 2016a). The chapters of this volume assess the evidence, debate different concepts, identify policy avenues and display practical management applications that highlight the potential of NBS in tackling global challenges related to climate change and urbanisation. The authors critically review and present recent findings how urban ecosystem management can be employed to adapt to climate change effects, while at the same time contributing to social and health benefits. The examples discussed for ecosystem services and co-benefits in this volume comprise case studies concerning climate change mitigation via reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as climate change adaptation by enhancing the regulation of air quality and temperature, contributing to water cycle regulation, provision of recreation potential as well as improvements for human well-being and mental health. In this conclusion chapter, we summarise the main outcomes of the chapters in this book. Considering current European policy as well as recommendations drawn by the ENCA interest group on climate change from the outcomes of the European conference on âNaturebased solutions to climate change in urban areas and their rural surroundingsâ (Kabisch et al. 2016b), we develop recommendations for putting NBS into practice and policy and outline outstanding challenges for science and society."

Scientists and representatives of the business community have not denied that further research is still needed with regard to potential risks and that risks cannot be ruled out until the toxicology is more advanced. This helped build trust. The situation could be described somewhat paradoxically as follows: Because all sides have openly discussed the need for further research and potential risks, the debate has remained constructive. The gaps in the science regarding potential risks has been construed as a need for research rather than cause for demanding that products with nanomaterials be barred from the market. Rather than insisting on the absolute avoidance of risks (zero risk), trust that any risks will be dealt with responsibly has been fostered."
114,32,0.337,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Safety Is a Moving Target Safety is, in a number of respects, a constantly moving target. As standards improve and concern for safety grows within a system, a larger number of events will come to be considered as safety issues. In a very real sense innovation and improving standards create new forms of harm in that there are new ways the healthcare system can fail patients. In the 1950s many complications of healthcare were recognised, at least by some, but largely viewed as the inevitable consequences of medical intervention (Sharpe and Faden 1998). Gradually, certain types of incidents have come to seem both unacceptable and potentially preventable. The clearest example in recent times is healthcare-associated infection, which is no longer viewed as an unfortunate side effect of healthcare. With increased understanding of underlying processes, mechanisms of transmission and methods of prevention, coupled with major public and regulatory pressure, such infections are becoming unacceptable to both patients and professionals (Vincent and Amalberti 2015). In the last 10 years, as more types of harm have come to be regarded as preventable, the perimeter of patient safety has expanded. A larger number of harmful events are now regarded as âunacceptableâ. In addition to infections we could now include, in the British NHS, pressure ulcers, falls, venous thromboembolism and catheter associated urinary tract infections. In the United Kingdom the Francis Report into Mid Staffordshire Hospitals NHS Trust highlighted additional risks to patients, such as malnutrition, dehydration and delirium all of which are now being viewed as safety issues. We should also consider adverse drug reactions in the community that cause admission to hospital, polypharmacy and general harm from overtreatment. All these, in the past, might have been regretted but are now receiving greater attention through being viewed under the safety umbrella. The perimeter of safety is therefore expanding but this does not mean that healthcare is becoming less safe. A long-standing concern with safety in such specialties as anaesthesia and obstetrics is actually a marker of the high standards these specialties have achieved. Safety is an aspiration to better care and labelling an issue as a safety issue is a strongly motivational, sometimes emotional, plea that such outcomes cannot and should not be tolerated (Vincent and Amalberti 2015)."
320,304,0.336,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Major challenges in adapting nature conservation management originate from a lack of sufficient understanding of the complex functional relations in natural systems and from uncertainties in predicted changes or impacts due to climate change. Additionally, knowledge about the effectiveness of different management practices is usually scarce or poorly documented. A methodical adaptation approach has to deal with these uncertainties and knowledge gaps in order to foster decision making with a limited workforce and limited time and funds available at local levels (Hansen and Hoffmann 2011). External scientific input and support is essential for all protected areas but must be tailored to meet the needs and decision contexts of each areaâs management (see Chap. 5)."

This has led to continuous tensions and antagonisms about access to natural resources, the distribution and use of revenues, and the distribution, compensation and prevention of environmental and social costs (Alimonda, 2011). In Latin America, issues of poverty, inequality and environmental protection are thus closely intertwined. Despite academic studies showing the risks of being a global provider of foodstuffs, energy, metals and environmental services without appropriate institutional arrangements, not much progress has been made in successfully tackling problems of underdevelopment (Bunker, 1988), impoverishment/marginalization (Martinez-Alier, 2002), inequality (Therborn, 2011), accumulation by dispossession (Harvey, 2003), and disempowerment and dependency in rural communities (Painter and Durham, 1995). After a long history of elite capture and foreign exploitation of Latin American mines, agrarian lands and, later, oil and gas resources, social and political forces started to push forward reforms such as the nationalization of oil and metals, and the distribution of land in the twentieth century. Nevertheless, access to resources, revenues and power remained unequally distributed at local, national and international levels. The neoliberal regimes of the late twentieth century went against previous redistributive policies (Liverman and Vilas, 2006). This period was marked by greater attention to both environmental protection and decentralized decision-making (Larson, 2003). However, restricted funding and liberalized markets limited the potential to break with historically established patterns. This new environmental, social and institutional context also changed environmental governance in Latin America. Both in rural and urban areas, poor citizens became more vulnerable due to environmental degradation and the increased intensity and frequency of climate disasters, including droughts, ï¬ooding, hurricanes and glacier retreat (Rios and Veiga, 2010). In many countries, especially in South America, a new phase of widespread civic discontent and mobilization of groups against exclusion, poverty, inequality and technocratic policies started in the 1990s (Harris, 2003). While many groups only called for socioeconomic redistribution, indigenous movements, landless farmers and environmental organizations also demanded different policies towards land and nature (Carruthers, 2008; Urkidi and Walter, 2011; Latta and Whitmann, 2012). Since the turn of the twenty-ï¬rst century, Latin America has experienced radical developments that have changed the dynamics of"

The focus on a single currency with no other collateral than debt makes the human and ecological drama even larger. In nature, a diversity of lifeforms mingles in permanent pursuit of harmony, using different resources to develop. During a workshop at the Zoo of Emmen, the imagination of entrepreneurship was triggered through looking at the diversity of butterflies living together in a relatively small space, and peacefully at that, due to the non-competitive differentiation of size, food, reproduction, etc. Creating an ecosystem in economies can overcome problems of current models that live through single cyclic patterns. This also has its logic in the ï¬eld of human complexities. Not everyone goes through a crisis at the same time or in the same phase of their lives. Many people do this on their own and develop awareness and innovative patterns ahead of the mainstream. If their leadership is blocked by a formalized mainstream, then progress is blocked out of the systemâs self-interest. Negative tension then gradually builds up. However, if the leadership receives freedom to deploy itself, it generates a positive tension between the robustness of the mainstream and the argumentation of renewal. When we deployed AiREAS, we addressed the awareness level of human beings at different levels of society ï¬rst. When asking a deeply aware human being about the need for core human values, hardly any resistance is felt. If this is seconded by the proven vulnerability that builds up in the institutions, then the professional position of that same human being involves making a choice: contribute to the core values through the authority of the position, or negate awareness by supporting the mission of the institution, even if it proves damaging to the core values. Awareness and guts are human factors that become decisive for taking individual entrepreneurial action, but when these factors are combined in a multidisciplinary, awareness-driven co-creation, change is a fact. The human being comes ï¬rst, awareness places the core values as a permanent goal, and leadership produces the required change for harmony. We use our institutions, knowledge and technology as instruments for progress, rather than submitting to them in dependence. We have been attempting to prove this by going through our own value-driven cycles. Every exercise in AiREAS has been developed through this method of combined entrepreneurial approach by bringing people and authorities together behind the awareness switch. A whole new dialogue appeared, including new vocabulary to express ourselves without continuous disputes about the meaning of words in the different contexts."

Hence, the adaptation of management needs to be included in a broader assessment framework to be useful in a decision-making context. This framework should comprise methods to compare scenario results as well as methods to evaluate options and prioritise actions. Risk management is suggested as one tool to provide this framework (e.g. Rannow 2011, 2013; Lorenzoni et al. 2005; Willows and Connell 2003). âStress testsâ that help to identify critical changes and thresholds for resilience of ecosystems might be another tool (Brown and Wilby 2012)."

This repetition reflects the extent of the trauma, which is permanently engraved in the collective memory. These representations superimpose the natural and technological dimensions of the disaster. In the documentary The World after Fukushima [37], a lateral tracking shot reveals a landscape devastated by the earthquake and tsunami. Shots of abandoned buildings and heaps of debris follow. The commentary indicates that the accident was caused by the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, but that the real causes lie in the weaknesses of a system âwhose arrogance was matched by its blindnessâ [37]. These words modify the images by associating the damage caused by the tsunami with the consequences of the accident. It is the inï¬nite extension of a war zone, says the narrator. In the documentary Fukushima, Particles and Mankind (Fukushima, des particules et des hommes) [38], color drawings show familiar places: a neighborhood, houses, cultivated ï¬elds. A whitish vapor, full of radioactive particles, spreads over the scene. This represents the âinvisible evilâ. It emphasizes the deviousness of the threat, and calls into question the reliability of our senses and reality. The Fukushima accident is open-ended and illustrates the theory of the risk society [28]. The documentary Fukushima, a step towards global contamination (Fukushima, vers une contamination planÃ©taire) [39] reveals that tuna caught off San Diego (United States) were contaminated with cesium waste from the damaged plant. The same observation is made in frozen ï¬sh sold in Switzerland. The globalization of risks is such that all consumers are potential victims of Fukushima. Furthermore, the disaster is shown to be a repeat of history. As the lateral tracking shot in The World after Fukushima fades out, it is followed by a new shot. This sequence consists of archive black and white images, recorded on August 6, 1945 at Hiroshima. The landscape scrolls across the screen and ends with a ï¬eld of ruins, which appears to be the continuation of the previous shot. Hiroshima and Fukushima are therefore merged into one, single atomic energy catastrophe.11 The analogy is highlighted by a vertical panorama from the Genbaku dome,12 where the sequence ends. The camera rests on the reflection of the building on the surface of the River Ota, highlighting the parental relationship between the two events.13"

233,622,0.336,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Phylogenetic diversity is now a core part of conservation biology, reï¬ecting its link to option values and to evolutionary potential. Further, there is good overlap with related issues in broader ecology. These include community ecologyâs interest in productivity (e.g. Cadotte et al. 2012), resilience (e.g. Pugliesi and Rapini 2015) and the functioning of evosystems (e.g. Srivastava et al. 2012) and microbial ecologyâs use of PD as a cornerstone for exploring diversity patterns at multiple scales (Lozupone and Knight 2005, 2008; Faith et al. 2009). As the chapters in this book demonstrate, the development of new methods and their applications are very much tuned into human impacts and sustainability issues. Thus, red listings, drivers of extinction, and changes in spatial and temporal distribution of phylogenetic diversity are common elements of these studies. All this promotes the incorporation of phylogenetic diversity in the international conservation agenda. These prospects are magniï¬ed by the remarkable facilities for obtaining entire or large parts of genomes or other molecular sequences of any kind of organisms, and by the sheer magnitude of biological (gene sequences, trait databases, species occurrences, red lists) and environmental data (climate layers for past, present and future interpolated to very ï¬ne spatial scales; land-use layers, spatial data indicating particular important risks such as ï¬res, ï¬oods, and so on) now available in the public domain. All these allow for rapid estimation of the phylogenetic relationships for a large number of organisms in association with potential distribution and threats for species and lineages. In addition, under the stimulus of modern phylogenetic and molecular methods, systematics is going through a signiï¬cant transformation that will certainly inï¬uence biodiversity conservation (Mace et al. 2003; Pons et al. 2006; Vogler and Monaghan 2006; Faith et al. 2010; Yahara et al. 2010). For closing this book, we will brieï¬y describe this transformation of systematics and then discuss some impacts of these changes in biological conservation. We ï¬nish by exploring the possibility of deï¬ning âplanetary boundariesâ for biodiversity on the basis of phylogenetic diversity, and its important role in linking biodiversity into broader societal perspectives and needs."

We have argued that large-scale conservation decision-making would beneï¬t from agreement on a general measure of biodiversity, one that is not tied to particular projects or contexts. We have set out a group of broad categories of measurement strategies with the aim of determining whether one of these might furnish an appropriate general measure. In this section, we set out a similarly broad brush taxonomy of philosophical justiï¬cations for the conservation of biodiversity with the aim of determining whether any of those available might provide a justiï¬cation for conservation based on a general measure of biodiversity and hence might provide us with a basis for inference about the nature of such a general measure. We will argue that the best justiï¬cation is one that respects the plurality of human and non-human interests in biodiversity as well as uncertainty about how best to secure those interests and about future changes both in the environment and in human affairs. Philosophical justiï¬cations for the conservation of biodiversity come in many forms but all such arguments fall into one of four categories."

252,69,0.336,The Ethics of Vaccination,"In discussing the problem of what should be done to counteract global warming, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong has suggested something resembling the idea I have just put forward. He argued that individuals do not have a moral obligation to avoid taking oneâs car for leisure drives on Sundays to prevent global warming, because the impact on global warming of any individual driving is negligible; rather, as Sinnott-Armstrong argues, it is governments that should intervene to prevent global warming, if necessary by prohibiting individuals from recreational driving on Sundays. What individuals have a moral obligation to do is simply âto get governments to do their jobâ (Sinnott-Armstrong 2005, p. 312), that is, as I have said above, to actively support the appropriate policies. Presumably, SinnottArmstrongâs argument could also be applied to the case of vaccination and herd immunity: individualsâ duty to prevent negative collective outcomes includes the duty to support effective policies with the potential for preventing those outcomes. Contrary to Sinnott-Armstrongâs thesis, I have provided here an argument, based on fairness, to the effect that individuals also have a moral obligation to contribute to the containment of global warming or to herd immunity by avoiding recreational driving on Sundays or by being vaccinated, respectively; they have these moral obligations even if their individual contribution to the collective cause is negligible. In any case, what matters for the purposes of the present discussion is that individuals fulfil their moral obligations to contribute to desirable collective outcomes (such as herd immunity) also by supporting policies that guarantee that herd immunity is realized. Now, as we have seen, Sinnott-Armstrong says that individuals ought to âget governments to do their jobsâ. But what is governmentsâ âjobâ with regard to vaccination policies? In other words, what are statesâ institutional responsibilities? Not everybody will agree with the following principle, and not everywhere is this principle equally accepted, but here I will assume that most people will agree with my understanding: a state has the moral responsibility to protect and promote individualsâ health, especially that of the most vulnerable people (such as those who cannot be vaccinated), by at least controlling those factors that (1) affect individual health, (2) are not under an individualâs control, and (3) that the state can permissibly control. For example, many countries have in recent decades implemented policies prohibiting smoking in public spaces in order to safeguard the health of non-smokers. If I am a non-smoker, other peopleâs smoke in public spaces is a factor that would affect my health, that is not under my"

These costs tend to crystallize in the political organization of Latin American societies, which aims to preserve and enhance social inequality and to keep the rural poor and indigenous populations out of political decisions. The Latin American literature is very closely related to the arguments advanced by European and Anglo-Saxon ecological economists and ecological sociologists. The ï¬rst have shown that the economic growth experienced by Latin American countries during natural resource booms has only been achieved on the basis of an unequal exchange of material ï¬ow (Vallejo, 2009; MartÃ­nez-Alier et al., 2010; Muradian et al., 2012). Similarly, Muradian et al. (2012) have noted that recent technological innovations in the extractive industries have made the exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon deposits â located in remote areas inhabited by indigenous peoples (the Ecuadorian and Bolivian Amazon, for example) â economically proï¬table. The expansion of the âextractive frontierâ implies the accelerated destruction of ecosystems that are essential for planetary survival, along with an increase in socioenvironmental conï¬icts that put the cohesion of Latin American, and especially Andean, societies at risk. Environmentalist literature has made visible two innate elements of the rentier basis of the Bolivian and Ecuadorian states. First, the construction of rentier states represents a set of enormous environmental and social costs that are not only ignored by the literature of political economy and development economics but are also actively kept out of public discussion by academics, international ï¬nancial institutions and the governments that have controlled these states. Second, the set of rules that govern the extractive industries in the rentier states is insufï¬cient to achieve the objective of an environmental governance that ensures the sustainability of societies. The set of debates that I have outlined allows me to present the central argument of this chapter in order to display and analyse in the next section the evidence offered by Bolivia and Ecuador on what I have called âpost-neoliberal environmental governanceâ. Analytically, post-neoliberal environmental governance in Bolivia and Ecuador â and possibly in other Latin American rentier states â can be understood as a system of three layers. In the centre would be the rules of natural resources governance. These are the rules that govern the extraction of resources and the production of revenues for the states. At this level the number of actors is minimal since it only includes governmental elites, certain state agencies and the companies (public and/or private) that conduct mining activities."
284,338,0.336,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"of public services and the deterioration in the quality of those remaining in the public sector are a palpable threat to peoples in every country. Even as indigenous communities are asserting their new-found rights to proceed with forestry and water-management activities, governments are encouraging large-scale initiatives by transnational corporations that threaten to upset the delicate balance of productive activities on which the communities depend for their livelihoods and for ecosystem balance. These projects pose fundamental questions about the ability of the communities to defend their territories, including their substantial cultural, social and productive heritage that entrenches them in their ecosystems. The conï¬icts continue to this day, posing apparently irresolvable differences and often resulting in violent encounters, as mines, ecotourism and other projects (and with the recent reforms, fracking and other forms of resource extraction) threaten the very existence of the communities. The communities generally reject the assumption that the sacriï¬ces that this destruction entails can be compensated by monetary offers that would only force them onto a path of institutionalized marginalization as isolated individuals, a life of limited opportunities without the social support systems and safety nets that their communities offer. The ongoing initiatives to strengthen or generate âniches of sustainabilityâ by peasant and indigenous communities throughout the Americas are heartening and important. While the momentum in the global marketplace is clearly threatening social groups and environments everywhere, the continuing successful efforts of peasants and indigenous peoples to implement their own strategies for social and productive change that deliberately incorporate the environment in the process offer a window on the possibilities for making environmental justice a reality for increasing segments of the population. This will not happen where the capitalist structure of production and control dominates.

10,1,0.335,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Overcoming Drought and Water Shortages with Good Governance On June 20, 2013, a picture went viral on the Internet in which two students were seemingly sailing through the shopping streets of Enschede, my hometown and the biggest city in the region of Vechtstromen, a water authority in the east of the Netherlands. After an extraordinary downpour it was the ï¬rst time ever that these streets were flooded. It was quickly forgotten that just days before this same city was regarded a risky âhotspotâ of unusually high inner city temperatures after a long heat wave that caused many creeks in its rural surroundings to completely dry out. This example is consistent with a general pattern in many areas in Northwest Europe: weathers are often more extreme than they used to be and water management will have to cope with that, through increasing the resilience of our water systems. This book, based on the many insights that are gathered from the project âBeneï¬t of governance in drought adaptationâ (DROP, Interreg IVb NWE) provides an overview of a variety of drought situations in six areas in Northwest Europe, the measures taken to improve these situations and especially an in-depth treatment of the governance conditions that support or restrict the realization of these measures. The people in Northwest Europe that have always, and rightfully so, regarded themselves as living in a water rich area not only need to get used to more weather extremes, but especially to one of the extremes: drought. The availability of sufï¬cient water of apt quality for purposes such as agriculture, nature, and service and drinking water production has become less self-evident and will likely even become less certain in the future. Each of these three functions gets special attention in the comparative chapters in this book. Sufï¬cient freshwater supply is also important for shipping, use, and discharge of cooling water, and for flushing waterways in the low-lying parts of the country to prevent saltwater intrusion in a country such as the Netherlands. Generally, sufï¬cient freshwater supply is a matter of utmost importance as part of a good investment climate for economic activities that are"
383,46,0.335,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"The description and measurement of risk is about developing an understanding of the risk. It can be done qualitatively or quantitatively. The quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is also called probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). Formally, in a risk analysis, we are attempting to envision how the future will turn out if the decision maker undertakes a certain course of action (or inaction). The risk analysis answers the following four questions: â¢ What can happen? What can go wrong? What can go well? Can we create a list of all outcomes that can happen? What are the positive outcomes and negative outcomes? â¢ For each outcome, if it does happen, what are the consequences? What are the benefits or losses for each stakeholder? Some consequences can be small, some large. For example, an earthquake can have catastrophic consequences albeit with a small probability. Some consequences can be positive, some negative. How outcomes link to consequences? This may not be known fully, so a statistical analysis of causes may be done, or experts can be called for their opinion. Who are the stakeholders, i.e. people affected by outcomes? In the example of Janette getting a job, she is a stakeholder, additionally, her parents are stakeholders because if she gets a well-paid job, her parents do not need to support her as much or at all. Each stakeholder has some attitude toward each consequence; in future, we will call such attitudes the utilities. â¢ How likely is each outcome to happen? What is the likelihood or probability of the wrong outcome happening? What is the probability of a positive outcome? Some probabilities can be large, some very little. Is probability a useful way to measure uncertainty? There are other measures that we will learn later. â¢ What is the strength of knowledge that we have? What do we use to calculate the probabilities of events? Do we use past data or expert knowledge? Do we trust the expert(s)? Are data relevant? Do we have enough data? Are data noisy? The four answers to the questions above constitute four elements of risk,"

376,278,0.335,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The modern era of natural resource management has been characterized by human efforts to reduce variability and increase predictability in natural systems. This command-and-control paradigm is an extension of societal attempts to identify problems and design and apply solutions to control or mitigate those problems (Holling and Meffe 1996). Examples of command and control in natural resource management include wildfire suppression, fences to control large ungulate movements, weed control for herbaceous native forbs, predator elimination programs, and watershed engineering for flood control and irrigation, including dams, terraces, and subsurface tile drainage. Each of these practices employs human technology to attempt to modulate and regulate the spatial and temporal distribution of resources and complexity of ecological processes. As a result of these attempts (and others), modern natural resource management has created more simple and homogeneous landscapes, which have been considered to be more economically productive due to their perceived increase in predictability. Alongside resource homogenization, land subdivision, fences, transport networks, growing human populations, and other forms of development are increasingly fragmenting ecosystems into smaller management units (Hobbs et al. 2008). Paralleling command-and-control management is a scientific paradigm that likewise seeks to control or even eliminate variation. Generations of scientists have been trained to design experiments that control all variations except for that which is expected to drive the hypothesized differences. Extreme examples are greenhouse studies and small plot studies that attempt to control for weather and spatial variation, even though we are studying systems that are often described as nonequilibrial and interconnected with other systems. Data from such experiments have most often been subjected to Fisherian statistics, which describe differences between groups in terms of variation around mean values. These models have tra-"
166,36,0.335,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"of vulnerable people. As the preceding discussion testifies, conducting surveys of vulnerable sub-populations raises important questions about the extent to which conventional tools and procedures should be retained or adapted depending on the research context. This concerns all aspects of a research design from the methods used to ensure adequate representation of a particular target population, the tools developed for measuring pertinent theoretical constructs, to the procedures used to analyze the data. Alongside the various challenges involved in data collection described earlier, vulnerability research presents numerous measurement and analytical challenges to which methodologists must be able to respond. Vulnerability is multidimensional, which means that we have to care about measurement quality and not rely on single indicators. Statistical methodology also has to take into account this multidimensionality, by using adequate analytical strategies. Equally, as we have seen, vulnerability can be seen as the result of tensions between stressors and resources. The evaluation of social resources can refer to different types of capitals: economic and cultural, but is also linked to a web of social relations. In this sense, research needs to take into account âlives in contextâ, that is how individuals fit within their social networks and the characteristics of the social and institutional contexts within which these are embedded. All these features of the research domain present unique challenges for future collaborations between substantive and methodological experts. The rise in popularity of quantitative research into vulnerability has occurred at a time when survey methodologists are having to adapt the methods traditionally used to carry out surveys of the general population. This has been due to the deterioration of traditional sampling frames (particularly for telephone surveys), declining rates of participation, and rapid growth in information and communication technologies (Groves 2011). Survey research is changing. Paradoxically this revolution in how surveys are carried out comes at a time when survey methodology as a science has never been more knowledgeable or better equipped to both pre-empt and correct threats to data quality. Yet much of what has been learned so far has been derived from methodological research conducted alongside surveys of the general population. The empirical base is much more sparse for guidance about how best to survey those at the periphery of society, or how best to capture the dynamics of how individuals respond to major life transitions (whether they be normative or nonnormative). In the context of turmoil surrounding mainstream survey methodology, building up specialized areas of expertise around specific substantive research objectives, topics and populations of interest will be of paramount importance. Longitudinal surveys, such as the household panel surveys, are playing a key role in the vulnerability domain â particularly where funding is explicitly made available for methodological research (e.g. in the case of the Dutch LISS Panel, the UK Household Longitudinal Survey). Via this book, the LIVES projects, along with the Swiss Household Panel Survey, are similarly making essential contributions to the methodology of vulnerability research. A second argument for the essentialness of methodology concerns the use of the data themselves. The results of a survey are not simply âdataâ in the etymological"
28,230,0.334,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"follows the social-field multilevel approach illustrated by the hospital studies of Stanton and Schwartz. A field method was used because it became apparent early that self-mutilation was a complex product of many interacting and interdependent factors. Its ramifications extended throughout most of the hospital structure, and etiological factors could not be meaningfully evaluated in isolation.27 The approach of Alfred Stanton and Morris Schwartz (a psychiatrist and a sociologist, respectively), involves analysing the mental hospital in terms of relationships amongst staff members and between staff and patients, and of pathological symptoms (as far as possible) as social responses to conditions.28 Intriguingly, a much bigger sociological study is being carried out at PPI at this time, led by Anselm Strauss, a pioneering medical sociologist who studies symbolic interactionism with Herbert Blumer and later associates with Howard S. Becker and Erving Goffman at the University of Chicago. In the book that emerges from this project, Psychiatric Ideologies and Institutions (1964), there is considerable analysis of what they call the âAdolescent Scarification Crisisâ. Again, this is tackled much less in terms of individual psychopathology and is far more about how institutions deal with crises. It contains large amounts of verbatim content from a conference hastily set up to deal with the fissures between staff members who become openly hostile to each other, arguing about the best way to deal with the âscarificationâ. The sociological bent of Offerâs and Barglowâs psychiatric journal article coupled with the limited focus on individual symptomatology and pathology is striking testament to the influence of these sociologists. Offer and Barglow still use the language of suicide to a significant extent, claiming that âthe self-mutilation incidents were âsuicidal gesturesâ rather than âsuicidal attemptsââ, where the latter signifies a genuine attempt to kill oneself. They argue that in all bar one incident,"

229,156,0.334,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"The harmful cancer-worm was replaced with a similar creature which was beneficial to the patient and, crucially, controllable by the medical practitioner. Attempts at curing cancer with crabs and worms illustrate the degree to which many pharmaceutical cures tended to treat the cancer as a discrete entity, rather than redressing the humoral balance of the whole body â despite the fact that the authors of these cures did not identify themselves as interested in ontological disease models in an academic sense. This was partly a product of cancerâs imaginative construction as ontologically independent of the cancer patient. Such cures were also products of the expanding medical marketplace. As Harold Cook has pointed out, demand for new goods in this period meant that practitioners could make more money selling cures for specific diseases than they could balancing the complexions of a few wealthy patients.65 In this increasingly competitive environment, a gulf emerged between writers â often university-educated, licensed physicians â who emphasised the difficulty of curing any established cancer, and other medical practitioners, sometimes advertising in newspapers or pamphlets, who promised a quick, cheap and painless cure. Though licensed medical practitioners undoubtedly have the loudest voice in surviving historical documents, there nonetheless remain tantalising glimpses of the prestige achieved by some so-called empirics. In 1714, for example, Daniel Turner described one âfamous Cancer doctorâ as a âvillainous empiricâ, indicating that one might specialise in this disease as other unlicensed practitioners did in bone-setting or cutting for the stone.66 He advised those who had cancer that they should on no account [l]ist[en] after a promised Cure by cosening Quacks, or Cancer-curing Pretenders, who, to my Knowledge, have hastenâd great Numbers of People miserably to their Graves, who might otherwise (and that very tolerably) have spun out a much longer Thread and have kept under this really (so far as I know of Surgery) incurable Distemper.67 For their part, the âCancer-curing Pretendersâ attracted âgreat Numbersâ of people to their services by promising what Turner felt he could not. Advertisements for internal medicaments or gentle ointments to cure a cancer quickly and painlessly were frequently accompanied by testimonials from satisfied customers enjoying newfound âHealth and Easeâ.68 Why did these advertisers â some, licensed physicians, but many, apothecaries or âunauthorisedâ practitioners â give a prognosis so much more optimistic than that found in medical textbooks?

According to Tardif (2005, p. 25), the approach is based on the notion of the emergence of social innovation: As a localized process initiated by different actors who seek to change the interactions taking place between themselves as well as with their organizational and institutional environment â the whole with the aim to counteract the impact of crises while attempting to reconcile the different levels of individual interest, public interest and common good. The statistical analysis of data will make it possible to move from a micro to a meso and macro approach to studying social innovation. The assumption is that there are objects of study of relevance for social innovation that are not observable at the micro scale. At the meso level of analysis, such a database will allow for a new reading of social innovations in terms of the mechanisms, configurations, evolution and modes of dissemination in time and across locations and sectors of activity. The approach will, moreover, make it possible to focus on phenomena hitherto little studied in the QuÃ©bec context, such as the emergence and dissemination of innovation clusters, including their patterns and paths of institutionalisation or even their configuration into an innovation system, and to examine their impacts on social transformation, in particular with regard to the QuÃ©bec development model. This framework, once applied to QuÃ©bec, may be extended to other areas in order to conduct international comparisons. There are, indeed, times and territories where social innovations tend to multiply, taking the form of innovation clusters, especially at the onset of crises or in economies with plural tendencies (Klein et al., 2013). Innovations are, then, oriented along emerging socio-technical paradigms, such as new representations of problems and possible solutions or experiments that were successfully carried out in organisations and local communities. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s in QuÃ©bec, when the crisis of Fordism and the welfare state became apparent, social innovations arose in the areas of labour, people services, collective enterprises, public policies and local development (the areas that CRISES focuses on). Using the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, it will be possible to trace the dynamics of the emergence of these innovations as well as their spread into clusters and their wider impacts on society. For example, a researcher might study the proximity effect, which is a phenomenon that promotes collective dynamics with the potential to modulate or reject the dominant forms of social control or"

167,187,0.334,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"The public health strategies in most European countries developed a combination of public health focusing on both environmental and individual health policies. Preventive measures and public health propaganda (the hygienic movement) became key features, and gave Sweden a comparatively low health care expenditure, and there was a strong ambition to create a welfare state (Sundin and Willner 2007; Rehnberg 1990). As it happened the first national health and living conditions survey took place in northernmost Sweden 1929â1931. The so-called Investigation of the North involved 4400 physicians and dentists and 17,400 northerners, and concluded that the diet had to be improved with more vegetables, housing must improve, gardening be developed, and school medicine be established. It also noted that cardo-vascular diseases and alcoholism were relatively rare. One might argue that the efforts to create the Investigation of the North were important for the development of research at the hospitals generally, and to the establishment of UmeÃ¥ University 35 years later. The development of health care systems varied to a great extent over the Arctic. But all systems had to take on similar challenges dominated by large regions with long distances between people, a cold and often harsh climate, limited resources, and difficulties to recruit health professionals. International research collaboration was intensified and in 1967 the first Circumpolar Health Symposium was arranged in Fairbanks. When the scientific conferences were evaluated 35 years later, the conclusion was that three fields of research had dominated the conferences: epidemiology of indigenous peoples, health care delivery and effect of physical factors on human physiology and health (Bjerregaard et al. 2003). Arctic health conferences during the past decade reveal that the field has added strong initiatives on new technologies, digitization and e-health, living conditions, occupational health, climate, the spread of infectious diseases, indigenous health and mental health, and suicide problems to their activities. Collaboration has also been a key strategy for the international Arctic research community. The three science organizations with observer status to the Arctic Council have all health on the agenda. The International Arctic Social Science Association (IASSA) has 20 health session at the ICASS IX conference in June 2017 and the International Arctic Science Committee has a working group (SHWG) that includes health issues and has supported initiatives on health statistics in the Arctic. University of the Arctic has a thematic network on health and well-being. And a great manifestation of Arctic health research is the International Congress on Circumpolar Health that has sixteen conferences behind them, last time arranged in Oulu, Finland 2015. IASSA, IASC and UArctic have signed a Letter of Agreement which increases the opportunities to work towards health sustainability, and research driven by solutions and social impact. Sustainability, solutions, and social impact are important goals for health care in the Arctic. National and regional health care organization, and scientific collaboration have proved to be important for the implementation of the goals. Nevertheless, there are considerable challenges for good and equal health in the Arctic that remain. These are general challenges, even if there are great disparities in the region.

260,11,0.334,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"the anthropogenic translocation of sublethally infected salamanders over large geographic distances (Storfer et al. 2007; Picco and Collins 2008). Thomas Waltzek at the University of Florida is currently sequencing the entire genomes of dozens of ranaviruses from around the globe, which will enable him to look at phylogeographic patterns, and identify areas of recent introductions. In general, pathogens emerge in populations either because they are novel or due to an increase in environmental stressors that decrease host immune function. As described above, there is support for the first hypothesis, and it is likely a consequence of pathogen pollution (i.e., the human movement of infected animals or contaminated fomites over large geographic distances, Cunningham et al. 2003). Furthermore, although research is limited, there is evidence that insecticides, herbicides, and the use of wetlands by cattle can act as stressors and increase the chance of ranavirus emergence (Forson and Storfer 2006; Gray et al. 2007; Kerby et al. 2011). In the past 4 years, >90 % of the cases of ranavirus infection and disease have been reported (Duffus et al. 2015). While enhanced awareness of ranaviruses and increased sampling efforts probably contributes to increased detections, it is unlikely that these factors are solely responsible. In this contribution, we provide a comprehensive and current review of ranavirus taxonomy (Jancovich et al. 2015a), virus distribution (Duffus et al. 2015), hostpathogen ecology and evolution (Brunner et al. 2015), viral replication strategies (Jancovich et al. 2015b), host antiviral immunity and viral countermeasures (Grayfer et al. 2015), ranavirus pathology and diagnosis (Miller et al. 2015), and suggestions for the design and analysis of ranavirus studies (Gray et al. 2015). Collectively, this work provides an up-to-date overview of ranaviruses and their impacts on host organisms, and reflects the contributions of investigators (i.e., molecular virologists, immunologists, ecologists, veterinary pathologists, population biologists) possessing diverse skills, but united in their interest in ranaviruses and the diseases they cause. In addition to this book, professionals around the globe have been working together to learn about ranaviruses. For example, two international symposia devoted to ranaviruses (Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2011; Knoxville, Tennessee, 2013) brought together scientists interested in understanding ranaviruses and their disease potential (LesbarrÃ¨res et al. 2012; Duffus et al. 2014). A third symposium is planned for Gainesville, Florida, USA in 2015. Between the 2011 and 2013 symposia, investigators interested in ranaviruses founded the Global Ranavirus Consortium (GRC). The goal of the GRC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among scientists and veterinarians conducting research on ranaviruses and diagnosing cases of ranaviral disease. Specifically, the GRC aims to: (1) advance knowledge in all areas of ranavirus biology and disease, (2) facilitate multidisciplinary, scientific collaborations, (3) disseminate information on ranaviruses, and (4) provide expert guidance and training opportunities. The GRC accomplishes these goals by hosting a biennial symposium, organizing regional workshops and discussion groups, and maintaining a website (http://ranavirus.org) with various resources including a current list of ranavirus publications and laboratories that test for the pathogen. They also are leading an effort to create a Global Ranavirus Reporting System, which will be an online data management system that allows cases of ranavirus infection and disease"

When prompted, the GIS-prepared climate change maps can be helpful in raising the climate change awareness among public and these maps should, therefore, be prepared. Climate change affects food production, with particular reference to urban agriculture and the associated impacts on food security. The value of urban agriculture to the health and nutrition of developing and developed countries needs to be assessed. There are international, including urban, aspects, such as agricultural disruption, economic disruption and logistical disruption to food availability, food access and food quality as a result of natural disasters remains an under-investigated topic. Climate change is affecting (and will affect) global food production and hence global food security. Urban agriculture plays a signiï¬cant role in maintaining and improving the health of city dwellers, particularly those disadvantaged. Climate change is likely to impact more severely urban environments with associated negative effects on food security. Existing research programmes are not addressing these aspects of climate change and deserve attention. Social, economic and environmental impacts on urban and peri-urban Indigenous communities inhabiting coastal areas need to be highlighted. These impacts include loss of community and environmental assets, such as cultural heritage sites, with signiï¬cant impacts on their quality of life and the establishment of potential favourable conditions for the spread of plant diseases, weeds and pests. Opportunities do not readily exist for engagement with climate change adaptation policy and initiatives and this is further exacerbated by acute shortages of qualiï¬ed/experienced indigenous members that could represent their communitiesâ interests in climate change adaptation forums. The evidence emerging from research shows that consideration of the future by many communities, even with the overlay of climate change and the requirements for serious considerations of adaptation, are signiï¬cantly inï¬uenced by economic aspirations which are seen as fundamental survival strategies for their communities. There are a number of local-speciï¬c issues that emerge from climate change, such as potential for indigenous involvement in the industry utilising wild plant species that may suffer from changes in species availability; concern about changes associated with peri-urban and urban development which appears to be escalating micro-environmental changes; peri-urbanisation as a major environmental change which threatens cultural assets; and indigenous communities that need to be represented in climate change adaptation forums and be more directly involved in land and sea care projects. Climate change awareness is an imperative to achieve sustainability in developing countries. Lack of awareness is a signiï¬cant barrier to climate change adaptation. Raising climate change awareness at the local level is critical, as climate change impacts are exacerbating the number and extent of disasters in different parts of the world. The development of an adaptation plan must be founded on a risk management approach to climate change at the local peri-urban government level. The approach can help build capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment and deï¬ne the area of operation, inï¬uence and responsibility in"
71,1249,0.333,Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides: Volume 1 ISDR-ICL Sendai Partnerships 2015-2025 (Volume 1.0),"The existence of reliable databases on disasters is crucial to study mortality due to landslides in terms of temporal trends, spatial distribution and epidemiological topics (Pereira et al. 2016). Features on fatalities caused by different types of hazards can be found for instance in natural hazard databases (e.g. EM-DAT, DISASTER) based on documental sources, demographic statistics, death certiï¬cates and civil protection authorities. There are some constraints in the inclusion criteria of mortality data in disaster databases. For instance, the EM-DAT only record disasters that have caused at least 10 fatalities, while the DISASTER database includes every landslide that caused fatalities regardless of their number. EM-DAT underestimates the numbers of fatalities and the fatalities are usually associated to the triggering event, such as earthquake, storm and floods (Haque et al. 2016). Another constraint to study the mortality caused by landslides is the relatively short time span of the existing databases and the lack of ï¬eld validation (Petley 2012). In Portugal, social impacts caused by landslides and floods occurred in the period 1865â2015 are gathered in the DISASTER database. This database includes social consequences (fatalities, injuries, missing people, evacuated people and homeless people) caused by landslides documented in newspapers (ZÃªzere et al. 2014). The DISASTER database contains 291 damaging landslides that caused 238 fatalities. In the present work we explore the mortality patterns resulting from damaging landslides occurred in Portugal since 1865. In this work we aim to: (i) analyse the spatio-temporal analysis of damaging landslides; (ii) analyse the frequency and the temporal evolution of fatal landslides; (iii) analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of fatalities generated by landslides; (iv) identify the most deadly landside types; (v) verify gender tendencies in mortality resulting from landslides; and (vi) evaluate the individual and societal risk."
97,533,0.333,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","With regard to disaster risk reduction, Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson also highlight the need for a long-term resilience thinking to tackle impacts from climate change and urbanisation. Reviewing the potentials but also the limitations of green and grey infrastructure for disaster risk reduction in urban areas, they suggest that intermediate âhybridâ approaches, combining both green and grey approaches, may be the most effective strategy for reducing risk from environmental hazards. This is especially the case when NBS approaches may be insufficient to meet the rising impacts of climate change, in case of space limitation or when resource limitations require cost effectiveness in the context of both climatic and economic uncertainty. A particular part of green infrastructure in cities â riparian forests and wetlands â are highlighted as NBS with particular benefits for dense urban areas. Dagmar Haase introduces the management of these habitats as a NBS with multiple benefits that include risk mitigation and adaptation concerning both climate extremes as well as enhanced flood and drought probabilities, while providing co-benefits such as a buffer against high air temperatures, water availability during heatwaves and recreation potential. The author presents several options that show wetland and riparian forestsâ functionality as NBS to better face the consequences of climate change in cities and urban regions and stresses that urban riparian forest and wetlands need to not only be conserved but also be restored in case of degradation. In line with the previous authors, Dagmar Haase also promotes a hybrid approach of combining natural remnants of wetlands and floodplain forests with technical solutions. To realise âmini-wetlandsâ and âriparian trenchesâ in areas disconnected from the river may also create new jobs. Following also suggestions by Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson, the complementarity of both NBS and technology may be a clever, pragmatic and at the same time innovative solution to complex socio-ecological problems. In addition, potential disservices from urban riparian forests and wetlands, including vector-borne diseases, e.g. transported via mosquitoes, may need to be considered as well with potential negative effects to human health. Careful consideration including such trade-offs can lead to more informed decision-making. Complementing the contributions by Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson as well as Dagmar Haase, in their chapter McKenna Davis and Sandra Naumann also focus on disaster risk reduction and introduce sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) as a NBS to flood risk management. Based on their case study analysis, including cost-benefit calculations in comparison with conventional piped drainage systems, the authors conclude that SUDS have a high potential as sustainable, costeffective approaches, which can complement pure âgreyâ infrastructure and can be applied within new developments or used to retrofit existing systems. Nevertheless, uncertainties about long-term maintenance, performance and cost (-effectiveness) are main barriers that limit the implementation of SUDS. Authors highlight that making lessons learned and data gathered from existing projects more widely available will support a larger uptake. Maybe most important to support the uptake of SUDS is the fact that NBS such as SUDS can provide multifunctionality, while purely grey and engineered solutions cannot."

Mankind remains almost everywhere bent under the yoke of the dictatorship of no alternatives. The hegemonic project in the rich North Atlantic region â the reconciliation of European-style social protection within American-style economic flexibility, undertaken as an accommodation of the mid-20th century institutional and ideological settlement to present economic realities â excludes more ambitious innovations even if advanced by fragmentary and gradualist means. Outside the North Atlantic region, the major emerging powers have little to show by way of alternatives other than state capitalism, combined with pieces of neoliberalism and compensatory social democracy. Their potential for spiritual rebellion and institutional invention continues to be suppressed under the burdens of a mental colonialism that their increasing power makes all the more surprising. The most insidious opposition, however, comes from the high academic culture, in which the social innovators might have expected to find friends. There, across the whole range of social and historical studies, tendencies of thought prevail that would, if they were to be believed, deny authority to what the innovators seek to accomplish. In the hard, positive social sciences â beginning with the most influential, economics â rationalisation predominates: a way of explaining present arrangements that justifies their superiority or inevitability by suggesting that they are the outcome of a cumulative convergence to best practice.

Here policy options are seen not as solutions but as hypotheses to be tested under a regime where formalized learning and management are objectives for which experimentation is the key (Rist et al. 2013). Interventions can be risky, especially in riverine SES, which are â. . .open systems that cannot be isolated from their social contextâ (Konrad et al. 2011). However, some river managers do choose to actively intervene in response to some emerging problem. Often a lack of data challenges managers trying to understand and manage how environmental ï¬ows contribute to the serviceable functioning of a river. A history of water control structure construction has almost eliminated naturally ï¬owing rivers. In North America construction of more than 2.5 million control structures have left less than 2% of all rivers naturally ï¬owing (Lytle and Poff 2004), with a similarly small percentage of naturally ï¬owing rivers in Europe (see Chap. 6). This denies most managers naturally occurring reference ï¬ow conditions to use as performance criteria. Social awareness of this extreme state has been heightened by the growing recognition of societyâs dependence on increasingly fragile aquatic resources. Many rivers are stressed and over-allocated in order to serve the demands of growing populations through hydro-engineering (Chen et al. 2015). In response, societal values have shifted to question this history, and managers have been compelled to modify operations of these control structures to mitigate physical and biological impacts on aquatic ecosystems (Rood et al. 2003)."

Green, blue and grey protection systems in combination may provide some of the most effective and broadly beneficial solutions against hurricane, cyclone, typhoon and storm surges in urban areas. Hybrid approaches, like all approaches, have pros and cons. Based on our literature review, we derived the main factors through which the three approaches (grey, green and blue, and hybrid) have been so far described and evaluated. These factors are analysed and listed in the first column of Table 6.2 as hypotheses, which need to be examined empirically to better understand the effectiveness of hybrid approaches for DRR and CCA. We assigned classes of low to medium to high performance to the three main strategies with respect to the factors identified in the literature, with particular considerations of the urban context. Grey infrastructures for DRR provide a wide array of drawbacks under most factors we consider (Table 6.2), but are, on the other hand, easily adaptable to the urban context. Green infrastructures, on the other hand, are flexible, no-regret measures and provide a wide range of benefits and co-benefits, which go beyond the mere protective or buffering functions. However, in the urban context these are often difficult to implement. Hybrid approaches fit well to the already hybrid nature of urban areas while providing solid solutions including many, if not all, of the co-benefits that more traditional green or blue approaches. Thus, at the very local scale, hybrid approaches are suggested as the way forward for DRR and CCA solutions in cities and urbanized regions."
365,702,0.333,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Despite the limitations of the analysis conducted here, some conclusions can be drawn. First, from a technical perspective, there appear to exist no âsilver bulletsâ for achieving climate-smart mixed systems. While this echoes the conclusions of the semi-quantitative analysis in Thornton and Herrero (2014), here we looked at a much wider range of possible interventions than was done there. Triple wins undoubtedly exist, but technical recommendations over broad domains that will work in all or even most circumstances may not be appropriate. Second, from an adoption perspective, a range of different constraints exist that may impede the widespread adoption of all these innovations. These may be to do with investment and/or running costs and access to technology and knowledge of how to implement it, as well as social acceptability and local governance issues. In different contexts, these may conspire to prevent the incremental and transformational shifts that may be needed to result in more climate smart agriculture in many places. Third, for some of the interventions evaluated, there are significant trade-offs between meeting shorter-term food production or food security objectives and longer-term resilience objectives. This applies particularly to crop residue management and altering the integration of crops and livestock within the system, but also to several other interventions (nutrient, soil, water management; grazing management; changing"

Increasingly, research that appeared in the American Journal of Psychiatry stressed the need for industrial physicians to âconcern themselves with the recognition of emotional factors underlying behaviour, which so frequently resulted in inferior output, high sickness rates, high labor turnover and absenteeismâ.150 Building on this approach, many large corporations developed psychiatric programmes for their workplaces, and feature articles in national newspapers attracted the attention of the general public.151 In addition to existing concerns about absenteeism and automation (that were commonplace in Britain), American literature regularly encompassed research on alcoholism, neurotic reactions and the more general application of psychiatry to business and industry.152 Many of these publications included case studies of interviews and medical examinations with male workers who were affected by emotional distress and psychosomatic illness. Writing in 1959, for example, W. Donald Ross, in his book Practical Psychiatry for Physicians, described an exchange with a coal worker complaining about shortness of breath. Having made passing reference to the death of a fellow miner in a rock fall, the worker âskirted aroundâ the subject to focus again on his symptoms. When it was suggested that the death of his friend might have bothered him a good deal, the worker admitted that he âhadnât liked to talk about itâ but had âworried considerably about itâ and was then able to consider the impact of this trauma on his own feelings and anxieties about the hazards of mining.153 This book included an entire chapter on âpsychophysiological problemsâ in which Ross explored a host of somatic presentations that might be caused by emotional distress, including: musculoskeletal disorders, asthma, chest pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, ulcerative colitis and spastic colon.154 Another chapter examined job stresses that were specific to workers of different grades, and the author observed that executive workers were not only prone to anxiety and depression, but also to a host of psychosomatic illnesses which included indigestion, headaches and hypertension.155 It is notable that Ross, despite what might seem like a progressive approach, still"
302,449,0.333,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"â¢ MPs in the freshwater environment are already outside their intended product cycle. Hence, it is difficult to address responsible stakeholders (producer, consumer, waste manager, etc.). â¢ Thus, it is even more important to clarify entry pathways into aquatic environment, to define standardized methods for exposure and hazard assessment, and to work in an integrated approach. An adequate regulation of environmental (micro)plastics is a huge challenge for research and policy. As plastics influence all parts of society, single fields of science or policy cannot tackle this issue individually. During the lifetime of a single plastic product â from design and production to trade and consumption to the correct recycling or disposal at the end of its functional product life â regulatory responsibilities change. This provides various possibilities for regulators to intervene before plastics enter the environment. However, it requires an interdisciplinary coordination of measures on different statutory, political, economic, and social levels. Only the interplay between all stakeholders from all countries results in success. (Micro)plastic particles do not respect political frontiers and, thus, accumulate in interregional waterbodies. For this reason, the need to treat this emerging environmental issue in an international context is increasing. Although â or precisely because â we currently know little about the consequences of MPs in aquatic systems, we should develop and implement measures to reduce further emissions. This is especially true regarding the high persistence and accumulation of these materials in the environment and in accordance with the precautionary principle."

347,101,0.333,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"In 2002, the EUâs CFP underwent a substantial reform process aimed to ensure sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources. This was a landmark shift in EU fisheries governance. Since then, the conceptual basis for fisheries management under CFP is the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) principle, the precautionary approach and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Key elements of this reform include (EC 2002): â The adherence to the precautionary approach to protect and conserve living aquatic resources and to minimise the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems â Adoption of a more long-term approach to fisheries management involving the establishment of multi-annual recovery plans for stocks outside safe biological limits and of multi-annual management plans for others stocks â Reduction of fishing effort as a fundamental tool in fisheries management, notably in the context of multi-annual recovery plans â Aim to progressively implement an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management â Increased involvement of the fisheries industry and other groups affected by CFP through the creation of stakeholder-led Regional Advisory Councils Interviewees suggested that the move to a long-term approach to fisheries management has mitigated (or has potential to mitigate) conflict around TAC levels between scientists and conservation groups on the one hand and fishers and managers on the other hand. This conflict arose because management decisions in the past usually were only âmoderately responsive to ICES advice in setting TACsâ (Patterson and RÃ©simont 2007). Generally, ICES advice is an answer to the question: âHow much fish can we take this year without running the risk of not having enough left over for long-term exploitation?â (cf. Wilson 2009: 10). Over the last two decades, as Wilson argues, the TAC finally decided upon by the Council of Ministers is close to but not as much as ICES has advised. According to scientists, conservation groups and also Commission staff interviewed, the TACs decided upon are not based on carefully weighted biological and social and economic considerations. Instead, they claim that the divergence is due to putting short-term economic and social interests before long-term ecological imperatives. Short-term decision-making along with poor enforcement is seen as the main cause for increased stock depletion risk and economic risks for fisheries and fishers, an issue exhaustively discussed in the scientific literature (cf. Aps and Lassen 2010; Villassante et al. 2011). Over the last 15 years, despite the growing importance of sustainable development, it is believed by many including the media that scientific advice has largely been ignored in European fisheries (Wilson 2009: 28). In recent years, however, there is some indication that TAC decisions by the Council of Ministers have been more in line with scientific advice. As a result, the percentage of European stocks considered as overfished has declined (Lassen 2009, p. 6; EC 2012)."

223,212,0.332,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"In 2009 the world found itself in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Events thought of as extremely unlikely, such as the burst of the U.S. housing boom, the meltdown of the financial system, and the bankruptcy of colossal companies, happened in breathtakingly fast succession. Why was the world so badly prepared for these improbabilities? One explanation is that the crisis of the financial industry preceding the economic recession occurred because the industryâs supposedly optimal risk-management models failed to reckon with âblack swansâ (Taleb, 2007)âunexpected and unpredictable rare events that carry an enormous impact. Of course, modern risk-management paradigms were not alone in failing to take the black-swan event into accountâso did individual players, such as many homeowners who could no longer afford their mortgages. Can psychological theories and findings account for such blind spots? At first glance, the answer is no. Influential studies in behavioral decision research consistently suggest the opposite propensity: People are oversensitive to rare events. For example, they overestimate the chance of getting food poisoning or of contracting lung cancer from smoking (Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, & Combs, 1978; Viscusi, 2002). Moreover, people are depicted as remembering past experiences by how they felt at their peak (rare moment) and end (Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996). Such oversensitivity is not only empirically observed but also theoretically suggested. According to the most influential descriptive theory of risky choice, people overweight low-probability events (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). In fact, cumulative prospect theory explains the puzzling co-occurrence of two R.

243,42,0.332,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"(Hughes 1987), have drawn attention to the contests among the actors and their strategies for promoting their own solutions or interests. From such studies comes a set of concepts that help us understand the role of network effects, which are the mechanisms at play in interconnected setting with a large number of actors with different agendas and interests (Arthur 1989, 1990; David 1985). For instance, recognising that value is generated by the network, not the parts in isolation, and that initial moves in a particular direction encourage further moves along the same path, is crucial. While in early stages in the evolution of systems the path is relatively open, at later stages it becomes more bounded or may create lock-in situations. Earlier research has illuminated what we may call on the one hand socio-technical complexity (caused by technologies being deeply embedded into organizations, and organizations being deeply embedded into technologies, see e.g. Leonardi 2011) and on the other hand network-related complexity (caused by the unpredictable dynamics between a large number of connected actors without central control, see e.g. Williams 2016). Based on these insights, IS researchers have attempted to formulate different ways to think about and deal with large-scale, complex and interconnected information infrastructures â approaches that are sensitive to the presence of complexity. Based on a number of in-depth case studies in global organizations, Ciborra et al. (2000) challenge traditional management approaches based on a control paradigm and advocates more humble, iterative and incremental managerial strategies. âCultivationâ is a metaphor that serves to characterize this alternative approach, in contrast to the prevalent âconstructionâ mode based on detailed preplanning and tight control. A cultivation approach would prefer monitoring and intervention activities over strict control and ongoing adjustments over rigid preplanning. The evolution of the Internet is a paradigmatic example of technology development that has not followed the traditional managerial top-down approach. Hanseth and Lyytinen (2010) uses this case to derive design principles that are sensitive to (and exploit) the network effects that are a core defining feature of information infrastructures. To build (or grow) infrastructures is a challenging endeavour for several reasons: information infrastructures expand through integrating previously separate systems, however, integration is not only a technical concern of achieving interoperability, rather a process embedding political and institutional interests. For instance, in the context of national or regional e-health infrastructures, a large number of heterogeneous actors, including developers and usersâ organizations, are involved with diverging interests, which requires ongoing political negotiations (Sahay et al. 2009). In addition, large-scale infrastructural projects require adequate coordination mechanisms. Infrastructure development is characterized by uncertainty. It is basically an open process due to the many interdependencies that need to be dealt with. Furthermore, unintended side effects and the participating actorsâ reflexivity can add to the complexity (Hanseth and Ciborra 2007; Hanseth et al. 2006). Moreover, infrastructure development is a visionary and political process with a moving target. It deals with an extended time span, as infrastructures are designed today to address future and unknown needs of users."

376,667,0.332,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","In rangelands, various zoonoses (rabies, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, etc.) can be hosted by wildlife species but are most commonly transmitted to humans through their domesticated animals. For example, brucellosis, which affects most pastoral societies, is one of the most common zoonotic infections worldwide with more than 500,000 new cases annually (Pappas et al. 2006). Also, because human populations in rangelands depend to greater or lesser degrees on domesticated animals for their livelihoods, nonzoonotic diseases with wildlife reservoirs, such as foot-and-mouth disease, are also of concern. Political and social controversies at the interface between domesticated and wild animals in rangelands are thus likely to include disease issues of some type (Kock et al. 2010). Such controversies are heightened by the poor success rate of campaigns to eradicate diseases in wildlife reservoirs, with the notable exception of fox rabies in Europe where a safe and effective vaccine bait was available (Brochier et al. 1991). In systems where diseases co-circulate in livestock and wildlife, control efforts can be successful when they are targeted in livestock, such as with rinderpest for example (Mariner et al. 2012; Roeder et al. 2013). Similarly, in Spain,"

For instance, they do not discuss conditions under which individuals have to accept various sacrifices for the good of all. Thus, the kinds of concerns Gostin and communitarians more generally have about preventing the spread of infectious diseases, responding to bioterrorist attacks, protecting the environment, balancing preventive and acute medical treatments, and determining the extent to which one can foster or force limits on individual choices for the public good do not find a comfortable home in the most widely followed bioethical texts. Hence, concern for the common good, responsive communitarians would argue, should be added to the already existing core values on which bioethics draws."
38,434,0.332,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"monitoring perspective can be detected only through in situ observation. Locations at which changes in these variables are measured directly therefore tend to be distributed very sparsely, and often unevenly, across the planetâs surface. In contrast, changes in environmental driversâe.g. climate, land useâare often more amenable to detection through remote sensing, and therefore potentially mappable across large geographical extents. For applications in policy, planning or management that require complete geographical coverage of information on biodiversity change, predictive modelling can play a valuable role in translating mapped changes in key drivers, generated through remote sensing, into expected changes in biodiversity (Lung et al. 2012; Soberon and Peterson 2009). The models underpinning such translation can, again, be either deductive or inductive, with the latter derived from explanatory modelling of biological and environmental data distributed either across space alone (and therefore constituting another form of space-for-time substitution), or across both space and time. The remainder of this chapter explores, in greater depth, this last role of modelling in biodiversity monitoringâi.e., the use of predictive modelling to help map past-to-present changes in the distribution of biodiversity across large spatial extents."
299,96,0.332,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Economics is considered by academics as the queen of the social sciences, the most prestigious of the lot. It carries more weight in the public and private spheres than all the other social sciences combined. It is not an accident that the White House has a Council of Economic Advisers, but all suggestions to create a Council of Social Advisers have been rebuffed. Of the 19 public policy schools in the US, at least 18 are dominated by economists. In the private sector, MBAsâwhose training is more based on economics than on other disciplinesâoutrank other social scientists. Economists (to reiterate, many but by no means all or even most) draw on a metaconception of human nature, often referred to as homo economicus. People are assumed to seek to maximize their self-interest, which at least initially was equated with satisfaction drawn from the consumption of goods and services. It is a view that can be referred to as materialistic hedonism. This thesis is often expressed by the use of the term âutility.â The original concept of utility, as developed late in the eighteenth century by Jeremy Bentham (1789), is narrow: All actions are directed toward gaining pleasure or avoiding pain.1 Happiness, satisfaction, and pleasure are treated as synonyms (Gottheil 2013, p. 121). Utilitarian philosophy views pain and pleasure not only as sources of motivation, but also of ethical guides: âIt is for them [pain and pleasure] alone to point out what we ought to doâ and determine the âstandard of right and wrongâ (Bentham 1789). Along similar lines, John Stuart Mill (1863) wrote that âactions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness,â with happiness defined as âpleasure and the absence of pain.â When British philosopher Thomas Hobbes was asked why he gave a coin to a beggar, Hobbes replied that âhe made his donation with the sole intent of relieving his own misery at the sight of the beggarâ (Aubrey 1898, p. 352). Adam Smith (1776) famously argued in The Wealth of Nations that the market as a system relies on each actor pursuing his self-interest: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. (p. 14)"

73,565,0.332,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"whilst imperfect, the Cuban program met with notable (if unintended) successes in public and environmental health. Prior to the Special Period of crisis and disruption in the Cuban food system, Cuban dietary habits were poor with high consumption of sugar, animal fats, and rice, and low consumption of a very limited range of fruits and vegetables (Wright 2009). Environmental and public health impacts from the industrial agricultural system included chemical pesticide and fertiliser residue and increased mortality rates (Wright 2009). The food system was ï¬awed, and the Cuban government acknowledged the ï¬aws. It took the Special Period oil crisis, however, to move from knowledge to change. If pragmatism advocates for learning via experimentation and experience of what works, it is apparent from what occurred in Cuba that this knowledge alone is unlikely to be enough to instigate change. Blomleyâs discussion of performativity theory (2013) points to failure and crisis in the (ï¬awed) dominant model as an entry point for alternatives. The post-Special Period food system reforms in Cuba involved extensive revisions of property rights. (This should be read, of course, from the perspective that Cuba is a socialist state with a fundamentally different political system than that of Australia.) At a rural level, the most signiï¬cant reform was the breakup of large state farms into unidades basicas de produccion cooperativas (UBPCs), small farming cooperatives located on the peri-urban fringe and run autonomously by groups of farmers (Gropas 2006). Under this scheme worker collectives were granted leases, rent-free, over state farm lands in permanent usufruct together with ownership of the goods produced (Deere et al. 1994). Within the cities, two key features of the Cuban program are the organoponicos and the mercados agropecuarios. The organoponicos are raised-bed intensiveproduction gardens located on public land (Viljoen and Howe 2005). The produce from the organoponicos and other sources is retailed directly to consumers via the mercados agropecuarios, local farmersâ markets in the city (Premat 2009). The Cuban program has separately promoted urban and peri-urban agriculture. The Agricultura Urbana program initiated in the 1990s concentrated on âpatios (domestic gardens), plots (empty lots planted to vegetables) andâ¦ organoponicos â low-walled beds ï¬lled with soil and organic matter, with or without drip irrigationâ (Hagelberg 2010). Plots, or parcelas, were located on a variety of available land types, including âparks, open baseball ï¬elds, and, more commonly, demolition sitesâ (Premat 2009) with this land being granted in rent-free usufruct (Premat 2012). Cubans were encouraged to use every possible urban space for food production. Private gardens and rooftops (patios) were transformed into spaces for chicken coops, pig sties, goat sheds, and vegetable gardens (Premat 2009). A separate and distinct program, Agricultura Suburbana, was implemented in peri-urban regions, on fincas (small farms) in âan eight-kilometre-deep ring between two and ten kilometres from urban centersâ (Hagelberg 2010).

278,225,0.332,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The concept of socio-economic metabolism is relatively young in the literature. Here we interpret the term in an inclusive sense that is synonymous with social (Fischer-Kowalski 1998; Fischer-Kowalski and Weisz 1999), industrial (Ayres 1989) and anthropogenic metabolism (Baccini and Brunner 1991). Modelling methods that incorporate anthropogenic stocks and ï¬ows can trace their lineage back to the early works of Forrester (1958), but examples where social metabolism and material and energy ï¬ow accounting are united with dynamic stock analysis are rare (Baccini and Bader 1996; MÃ¼ller et al. 2004; Lennox et al. 2005; MÃ¼ller 2006; Baynes et al. 2009; MÃ¼ller et al. 2013; Pauliuk and MÃ¼ller 2014). Even within that handful, few talk of the services from stocks that are germane to our discussion on sustainable development. There are a number of proponents of this integrated thinking and there is a natural application in urban systems. The âSocial-Ecological-Infrastructural Systems Frameworkâ of Ramaswami et al. (2012) begins with questions of urban sustainability and expands to the same scope as the socio-economic metabolism framework. They speciï¬cally include services from internal and âtrans-boundaryâ infrastructures, but the key difference from the socio-economic metabolism framework lies in the dynamic treatment of stocks in-use in the latter. In the following sections, we discuss key features of the socio-economic metabolism framework (hereafter the âmetabolic frameworkâ or approach) â see Fig. 6.2."

23,19,0.331,Anti-Vivisection and The Profession of Medicine in Britain : a Social History,"people mourned the deaths of animals and speculated on the possibility that humans and non-humans might share a common afterlife. It would be almost a century before most Christian denominations would seriously address this and other issues related to animals, and though many animal welfare projects were initiated with Christian intent, no mainstream church had much to say about the subject, and some defended vivisection. A perception of greater spiritual kinship between humans and animals arose, I suggest, through the influence of a variety of nonChristian sources, including classical paganism, esoteric philosophy, transcendentalism, and Western interpretations of so-called âEasternâ religions, the same influences that, channelled through the utopian ânew ageâ organisations that sprang up around the turn of the nineteenth century, would eventually inspire the environmental movement. The connection between what I shall call ânew ageâ thinking and antivivisection stemmed from a shared rejection of the agenda of scientific materialism in favour of a holistic worldview, in which intuition and feeling were as important as observation and experiment. Chapter 4 looks at the ânew ageâ programme through the work of Josiah Oldfield, the founder and medical director of Britainâs first vegetarian and anti-vivisection hospitals, and secretary of the Order of the Golden Ageâa Christian organisation committed, amongst other things, to health reform and pacifism. Oldfield was a campaigner for fruitarianism and antivivisection, and his career provides a case study of how medical opposition to cruelty was linked to aspirations for social and spiritual reform. His anti-vivisection hospital, a converted South London town house with only eleven beds was, as its critics eagerly noted, not intended solely for the benefit of its patients. Indeed, there were more vice-presidents than patients, the object being to attract sufficient public support to prove that an anti-vivisection hospital was a financially viable venture. Chapter 5 surveys the work of the National Anti-Vivisection Hospital, which opened in 1903 and continued Oldfieldâs project on a larger scale, challenging the state-sponsored âvivisectingâ hospitals and acting as a showcase for compassionate medicine. While it is likely that no animals were directly saved by the hospitalâs existence, it did spare the anxieties of the local poor, who feared hospitals that permitted vivisection would not scruple to experiment on their patients.

247,44,0.331,Humanities World Report 2015,"Archaeology, more than any other humanities discipline, benefits from the natural sciences (and their associated technology). But, increasingly in the field of environmental and climate science, the influence may be working the other way around. Archaeological research is becoming a more important source of evidence in these fields.20 History is closely intertwined with the social sciences, all of which include a historical dimension or subdivision, whether political, legal, social or economic. Indeed, the fact that history so obviously contributes to the social sciences says something about the arbitrariness of the distinction between humanities and social sciences. Also, history is becoming increasingly important in the understanding of environmental change. This is part of a wider trend, the âhistorical turnâ, where more and more academic disciplines are embracing an interest in historical perspectives. Historical research over long time-periods can bring a new perspective to the social sciences. For example, it has been shown that over time the world has witnessed a substantial decline in violent interpersonal conflicts. For instance, in Europe over the last three or four centuries there has been a substantial drop in homicide rates.21 Furthermore, it seems clear that there is a close and sustained correlation between manslaughter and alcohol consumption. Linguistics clearly influences the fields of psychology and sociology through social linguistics and psycholinguistics. It is also relevant to computer science."

We did not yet include in our analysis data sets or information products that were available only in Bengali. However, to our current understanding, based on the interviews and our literature and Internet search, this seems to be a minor fraction. We also did not include social media data, given that there is nearly no social media penetration among the affected communities.

178,112,0.331,Ethics Dumping : Case Studies From North-South Research Collaborations,"Recommendations The following steps are necessary to prevent ethics dumping between HICs and LMICs. â¢ Ensure the regulation of collaborative research. Studies involving international collaboration should only be allowed in LMICs if mechanisms are in place which ensure that the rights of participants will be respected at all times, and that sponsors, researchers, ethics committees or institutions, whether governmental or private, operating both inside and from outside the host country, are held accountable for their activities in the LMIC. â¢ Ensure a framework for transparency. Mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that trials are conducted in an open and transparent manner, and information about ongoing trials must be available and open to expert scrutiny, so as to prevent harm at any stage of the trial. The anonymized data, ï¬ndings and conclusions of the researchers should be open to scrutiny, so that the ï¬ndings and decisions on whether they should be used in public health policy can be properly evaluated. â¢ Provide compensation for research-related injury. Mariner (1997) writes: Since most legitimate research is intended to beneï¬t society as a whole, the subject assumes risk for societyâs sake (some would say making a gift to society). Therefore, society has a moral obligation to make the injured subject whole by compensating those who took the risks and suffered thereby. In addition, it may be argued that where society conducts, supports, or sponsors research, it voluntarily assumes an obligation to compensate those who are injured in its enterprise."

Predisposing factors are current and antecedent stresses that increase an ecosystemâs susceptibility to short-duration stresses, such as drought (inciting factor), or to longer term change in climate (contributing factor). Predisposing factors include stresses related to current states or values of variables that are internal to ecosystems and dynamic over ecological timescales (current regional climate, soil resources, biota, and disturbance regime; lower panel). In the upper panel, we illustrate a case in which climate change (contributing factor) exacerbates negative effects of a recent stress, such as drought (inciting factor), for a rangeland on which processes already are limited by a warm/dry climate, overgrazing, or a sparse, species-poor plant canopy (predisposing factors) to increase process variability sufficiently to change average process levels"
182,113,0.331,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Agricultural Society (HAS), their history reveals that in late nineteenthcentury Britain, diseased sheep were not perceived as the specifically veterinary problems that historians have assumed them to be. Rather, they appealed to, and forged connections between, experts in human medicine, veterinary medicine and the natural world. After introducing sheep, and the manner in which they were farmed, the first part of this chapter seeks to explain their positioning at the hub of this eclectic research network. It will document the investigations performed, and how sheep influenced and were affected by them. It will reveal that while sheep played multiple roles within the research network, their investigation was underpinned by farmersâ perceptions of them as products of place. On account of this perception, sheep were studied primarily in farmed environments, where they proved capable of making a difference to scientific enquiries. The remainder of the chapter explores how this mode of investigation changed in the early twentieth century, when investigators reconceptualized diseased sheep as hosts and transmitters of infection, decoupled them from their farmed environments, and promoted their investigation in laboratories in the hope of making them more amenable to human control. In the process, medical men and practical farmers became distanced from the scientific study of sheep, sheep lost influence over investigations, and veterinarians sought to capture sheep for themselves. This history therefore demonstrates how sheep first integrated, and then contributed to the disciplinary compartmentalization of experts in their diseases. The shifting approach to diseased sheep was informed by the institutionalization, disciplinary specialization, and growth of state funding for agricultural research.6 These changes are well documented by historians. However, in failing to award equal attention to the earlier mode of research,7 and to recognize sheep as key shapers and participants,8 authors offer a rather 6 Olby (1991), Vernon (1997), Kraft (2004), Woods (2013). 7 One"
255,3,0.331,Railway Ecology,"Eureka! The ï¬rst book on railway ecology has arrived. This pioneering edited volume, written by an international cast, brings together and synthesizes todayâs âstate-of-the-science and application.â Building on the diverse European railway network, the approach is global, with work also from North America, South America, and Asia. The ecological effects of railways are central, while the mitigation of effects appears throughout the book. Rich scientiï¬c highlights are compelling: wildlife mortality patterns; effects on biodiversity; the barrier effect; lots on ungulates, bears, bats, songbirds, and waterbirds. But there is also information on plants, elephants, amphibians, kites, gazelles, and many more, e.g., detecting mortality âhotspots,â and rail-side (verge) habitats, as well as case studies worldwide. Mitigations to minimize impacts emerge as a motif: wildlife crossing approaches; noise reduction; reducing outward noise propagation; alerting wildlife >2 seconds before an expected animal-train collision; reducing avian collisions and electrocution by the elevated net of wires; restricting access; and decreasing vibrations are also discussed in detail. Many nations are actively adding track, while high-speed trains are spreadingâ¦ for good reason. Rail transport is more efï¬cient than road trafï¬c at moving people and goods, and there is more fuel efï¬ciency; less greenhouse gas emission; less unhealthful air pollution; less trafï¬c congestion; and less land consumed. Most importantly, it is also safer. Furthermore, people personally depend on, and are affected by, trains. Trains take commuters to work daily. Every day we depend on long freight trains successfully carrying coal and oil. Many of us ride trains to other cities. Small towns often wither without trains stopping at their stations. Industry and jobs depend on trains bringing heavy resources, such as grain, coal, and minerals. We also buy heavy products, including autos, brought by train from factories. Train noise and their vibrations degrade our neighborhoods near the tracks. Infrequent chemical spills pollute water bodies and neighborhoods. Children wave at the engineer, and gleefully count the wagons/cars of long freight trains. Railway ecology really differs from road ecology. Thus much wildlife moves along rail corridors. At any location, noise from the trains is usually infrequent, loud,"

Human capital saw improvements at the domestic, productive and communal levels. The DRE system enabled other services, such as better education and health, and created more unity among neighbors. Lastly, social capital was impacted through the social acceptance of the projects, especially in projects that had a strong communal participation component which, in part, lead to robust governance structures that proved to be important for the DRE projects to meet climate change adaptation goals."

Despite this, it has signiï¬cant strengths as an indicator in a number of ways. First, it taps into a vast resource of existing data, and so is cost effective. Population abundance, for vertebrates at least, is one of the most commonly collected measures, both in discrete, time-bound studies and from continuous monitoring. Second, it tells a simple, easily understood message of overall, aggregate change. The LPI has achieved prominence as a tool for communicating global biodiversity change to the public via its central role in WWFs periodic Living Planet Report (WWF 2012). Third, it can be cut in various ways to answer different questions and provide indicators for different policy targets. From the global dataset it is relatively simple to draw out subset analyses, or cuts, of the LPI focusing, for example, on wetland-dependent species (of relevance to the Ramsar Convention) or migratory species (of relevance to the CMS) or harvested species (of relevance to sustainable use and human wellbeing concerns). Fourth, it can be improved with new data sources. Knowing where the data gaps are enables a focus on ï¬lling those gaps, whether through unlocking more existing data or by investing in new monitoring. Fifth, it can be applied in different settings and different scales. A national LPI built from within-country studies of population abundances of different species is simple and cost-effective to construct. Moreover, the same approach can be applied to create an index of aggregate change in habitat extent, as has recently been created for wetland extent for the Ramsar Convention (Dixon et al. 2016). In the same way, harmonising the use of metrics across policy contexts is not only an efï¬cient use of resources but also creates greater awareness and potential for mainstreaming biodiversity into other development sectors. Globally, metrics of forest change, ï¬sheries, threatened species and protected area coverage have been used to provide indicators in the context of both the CBD and the Millennium Development Goals. Nationally, there are increasing efforts to incorporate ânatural capitalâ (including biodiversity and ecosystem services) into national accounts (King et al. 2015). The more that biodiversity data can be used in these contexts, the greater impact it will have on decision-making."

92,21,0.33,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Migration and urbanisation attract much interest globally, reflecting growing concerns associated with the management of urban growth (UN-Habitat 2016) and, increasingly, around the ways in which these social and demographic processes are associated with health and wellbeing (Galea and Vladhov 2005; Grant et al. 2017; Nauman et al. 2016). Recognising that there are complex â but poorly understood â linkages between migration, urbanisation and health globally, the key elements of an emerging research agenda have recently begun to be mapped out (Grant et al. 2017; IOM 2016; Hanefeld et al. 2017). However â with few notable exceptions (Oni et al. 2016) â these agendas tend to focus on ways in which migration or urbanisation is associated with health, and are insufficiently Africa-oriented. In an attempt to contribute to addressing this gap, we use this chapter to reflect on our experiences in supporting early-career scholars to further the research agenda associated with migration, urbanisation and health in Southern African Development Community (SADC)."
260,133,0.33,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"One of the perplexing characteristics of ranavirus epidemics is the variation in the outcome, from no (apparent) mortality to massive die-offs. This apparent ârandomnessâ has led to the hypothesis that environmental factors, which can vary a great deal in space and time, may play an important role in disease outbreaks (Gray et al. 2009a). Natural and anthropogenic stressors are broadly thought to suppress immune function, making individuals in stressful environments more susceptible to infection and disease (reviewed in Martin 2009; Blaustein et al. 2012). Although many researchers use the term âstressâ to mean any aversive, generally unpredictable condition that would seem to challenge the organisms, there is a physiological basis to the âstress-induced susceptibilityâ hypothesis. It posits that chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoid âstressâ hormones have negative impacts on the immune system, such as reducing circulating lymphocyte populations, decreasing cytokine production, or suppressing cell-mediated immune responses (Sheridan et al. 1994; Haddad et al. 2002; Dhabhar 2009). Defining stress and identifying stressors and the responses they elicit a priori, however, is often difficult, particularly in the absence of detailed information on the environmental, developmental, and evolutionary context of the organisms (Martin 2009). For example, Warne et al. (2011) found that pro-metamorphic wood frog tadpoles challenged with a ranavirus had elevated glucocorticoid concentrations relative to controls and also experienced faster development and more rapid weight loss. As glucocorticoids are responsible for mobilizing resources (e.g., to respond to infection) as well as accelerating metamorphosis in pro-metamorphic tadpoles, the authors hypothesized that this surge in glucocorticoids led to an energetic trade-off. Only those individuals with large enough energetic reserves could support rapid development and a robust immune response at the same time (Warne et al. 2011). Clearly, linking elevated glucocorticoid concentrations to immunocompetence is fraught with difficulties, even with considerable context. It is thus not surprising that the reported effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on host susceptibility to ranaviruses are highly variable."

309,409,0.33,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"rapid shift of an impoverished food environment (through economic closure and the sidelining of some national food patterns and cuisines) to a context where food cultures are multiplying, intertwining, and becoming more complex is a potential source of concern and anxiety. The switch from a simplified food environment to a more complex one, in which certain influences coming from the outside are claimed by Vietnamese, has multiple and interacting effects: an increase in food anxiety, the destabilisation of regulatory devices, and a questioning of social identities. The feeling of anxiety is reinforced by the multiplication of crises and scandals that, as in many Asian countries, make the front pages of Vietnamese newspapers and the headlines of TV news. Here too, the different levels of crisis are entangled: food safety and health risks, food security (exacerbated since the international food security crises of 2008 and the Vietnamese stock building policies), fraud, and other controversies. In the face of the growing number of scandals due to the use of banned products in livestock and/or agriculture and the press reports, the Municipality of Ho Chi Minh City has announced the establishment of a âspecial committeeâ in charge of food safety (HÃ´ng Nga 2016). Controversies over GMO rice led the Vietnamese Food Association and its Thai counterpart to commit to zero GMO production (Rice Trade Cooperation 2006)."

209,41,0.33,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"In each study, the deliberative activities focused on emerging and potential nanotechnologies. Because the activities took place in a biology course, we focused on technologies that involved biological or health applications, such as the use of nanotechnology for creating new nanomedicines or for human enhancement. We chose nanotechnology as a topic of deliberation because, at the time of our studies, governments were calling for and sometimes requiring public engagement around nanotechnology. For example, in 2003, the US twenty-first Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (P.L. 108â153) required public input and outreach as part of ensuring âthat ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concernsâ¦are considered during the development of nanotechnology.â Abroad, a government-commissioned report on nanotechnology by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering argued for widespread and early public involvement during nanotechnology development (Royal Society/RAE, 2004). Table 2.2 shows some of the features of the background documents that varied between studies. The focus of the Study 2 document was nanogenomics. Between Study 2 and 3, the topics of the background document were expanded to discuss nanotechnology in general, as well as nanogenomics and nanomedicine, and the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) surrounding these technologies. In addition, between Study 3 and 4, revisions were made in response to student feedback that the"

Students reflected on that aspect with remarks about the importance of networking for the development of business. They acknowledge especially the examples provided. Networking is mostly regarded as positive but students also problematized it: âNetworking is very important to make choices that work for a longer time, but it also makes things more difficult, because opinions of people differ.

78,73,0.33,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"We tend to pay more attention to what entities are, or should become, and consider the interactions between them as secondary. For example, we focus on defining what the EU should be, trying to âovercome fragmentationââas we (too) often put itâin order to construct a coherent whole. By framing the issue in this way, we consider fragmentation as a negative and, as a corollary, consider unity as superior to fragmentation. Similarly, in our framing of relations with others, we often speak in binary terms: barriers (to be lifted), or walls (to be erected), for example. Thereby, we fail to pay proper attention to the quality and healthiness of interactions and relations between entities. We are too often inclined to think that the solution to our problems lies in greater leadership, or in upscaling power or control. In fact, sustainability rhetoric points to the need to rebalance the relationship to the self (focus on identity) with the relationship to the other (focus on interactions). Achieving both more integration and more diversity can only be done with a relaxed approach to identity and a constructive approach to otherness6. With the digital transition, the importance of interfaces and interoperability is central. The primacy of interactions becomes a matter of fact, and identity is to be seen as the result of all interactions, instead of as a control variable. One of the practical implications of this mental shift is to pay less attention to size, to minimise narcissist concerns, to go beyond the fragmentation diagnostic and to analyse instead how the quality and efficiency of interactions can be improved to serve the overall purpose."
241,1318,0.33,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(proximate causes) and background warming (here a proxy for external forcing causing global warming). In this case, it could be concluded that winter 2009/2010 was a cold winter despite global warming and an exceptionally cold winter given global warming. Identiï¬ed proximate causes of extreme events are often perceived as contradicting a potential human influence. This is generally not the case. An extreme event is by deï¬nition rare and thus will only occur under particular conditions. Therefore, a large fraction of the intensity of an extreme event may be due to internal variability or, equivalently, an extreme event may not occur due to external forcing alone. This gave rise to the widespread public belief that it is not possible to attribute a single event to climate change. External forcing, however, can have a strong influence on the frequency of occurrence of extreme events as events that are exceedingly rare (or common) in the pre-industrial climate may become more (less) frequent due to external forcing. The subtleties and importance of clarity in relation to the question asked in event attribution are illustrated by the case of the Russian heat wave of 2010. Dole et al. (2011) identiï¬ed atmospheric blocking and thus natural internal variability as the main contributor to the intensity of the heat wave. In contrast, Rahmstorf and Coumou (2011) concluded that with a probability of 80 % the Russian heat wave would not have occurred without the recent large-scale warming (most of which is attributable to human influence). The apparent contradiction is resolved by Otto et al. (2012), pointing out that whereas anthropogenic forcing only contributed relatively little to the intensity of the heat wave, it increased the estimated return time of such an event considerably (see Fig. 23.4). In addition to the challenging distinction between the roles of proximate and ultimate causes, attribution of extreme events may be subject to selection bias. This selection bias relates to the fact that it is usually time series with recent extreme events that are studied (see for example Stott et al. 2004 and Coumou and Rahmstorf 2012). Selection biases could be avoided by using operationalised systems that routinely assess the attribution question for a set of pre-speciï¬ed indices. Attribution of extreme events (and climate change in general) to both proximate and ultimate causes is important to improve understanding of the climate system and to enhance predictability of extreme events.

First, amid all the concerns about the resource depletion, those about the limits for inanimate resources would go away. Those that remain would be over biological and energy resources, and as we will discuss later, these, too, would be fine rovided we proceed in accordance with Vision 2050 and the Platinum Society proposal. Thus, when it comes to saturation of man- objects, we are moving forward as I projected two decades ago in ChikyÅ« jizoku no gijutsu. In short, at present saturation is roughly being reached in developed countries. Because of he breakneck economic growth that China â a developing country at that time â has managed, it is closing in on saturation and may have even overshot it. Globally, 2050 will be the turning point on saturation of man-made objects, and it is conceivable that by that point, we should have put into place the technology, systems, and economy of a circulating society."

This enabled to assess it along the four governance criteria of extent, coherence, flexibility and intensity. The essence of those criteria will be repeated each time before describing the observations done in Twente region. The focus of the analysis will again depart from the perspective of the realization of the projects in the Twente region.

302,350,0.329,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"plastic pellets when measured by number, the mass of the plastic pellets exceeded planktonic mass six times [23]. This âlitter artifactâ in the middle of the ocean was popularly called the âGreat Pacific Garbage Patch,â which had a significant impact on the public perception of the problem. The linguistic framing of the plastic pollution repelled the public by playing on the yuck factor, similar to the case of GMOs described above. The pollution was also unknown to many, making the novelty of the problem significant (driver 7). On the other hand, this description did give some backlash since it created an illusion of islands of plastics floating around in the ocean. Since such islands do not exist in reality, some commentators have argued that the environmental problem was exaggerated and that this could erode citizensâ trust in institutions [24]. Plastic pollution was not perceived as such a big risk in the decades after the first reports were published. This can be explained using several of the risk perception drivers (Table 1). Since plastic pollution was first reported as a phenomenon on the open ocean and not related directly to severe impacts on marine species and ecosystems, it was not perceived as a risk with âpotential for disasterâ (driver 4) nor a contamination that impacted a large group of people (driver 5). Debris in the middle of the ocean has no direct link to any human populations per se, which might also have affected the lack of public response (driver 5). Furthermore, oceanic pollution is abstract and not so tangible since it is not easily visible to most people. Therefore, the âGiddens paradoxâ (driver 8) might also have influenced the lack of perceived risk in these early years. Finally, there was very little information communicated to the public about the problem, for instance, from 2004 to 2010, microplastics were only mentioned a few times in UK newspapers, whereas the number of articles grew markedly in the following years [25]. Since people obviously cannot perceive a risk that they are not aware of, this lack of communication is a final but very important reason for the lack of early alertness to the problem."

The pace and scale of dam construction and other forms of river modiï¬cation are reï¬ected in the scale of impacts on aquatic ï¬ora and fauna. The greatest acceleration of biodiversity loss due to human activities in human history has occurred since 1970 (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The drivers causing loss of biodiversity and, hence, of ecosystem services are either steady, show no evidence of declining over time, or are increasing in intensity. By aggregating the trends of some 3000 wild species, the Living Planet Index has documented a 40% decline in average species abundance between 1970 and 2000. The more rapid decline (50%) of inland water species underscores their greater vulnerability, being closer to the workings and by-products of human enterprise, while both marine and terrestrial species declined by about 30%. The concomitant loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services has been driven by both steady and episodic changes to habitat (land use change and geo-engineering), climate, overexploitation of resources (water, soil, biomass), and pollution. Geo-engineering of rivers has systematically channelized rivers for transport and to increase drainage during high-water events and separated the channel from the ï¬oodplain to protect water-sensitive row crops and zones for high-density habitation, commerce, and industry and dammed rivers for hydropower (Zarï¬ et al. 2014) as well as for water storage as a hedge against drought. Damming rivers currently stores the equivalent of 15% of global annual river runoff (Likens 2010). As a result 48% of rivers (expressed as river volume) globally is moderately-toseverely impacted by either ï¬ow regulation, fragmentation, or both. Impacts could double should all planned dams be constructed by 2030 (Grill et al. 2015)."

They have argued for continued role in capacity building, implementation support, economic development, and information sharing programs, which can strengthen African statesâ recovery from crisis (Hendricks and Lucey 2013a, b). Some analysts have made the case for South Africaâs involvement in promoting civil society engagement and the Livingstone Formula, which states that âCivil Society Organizations (CSOs) may provide technical support to the AU by undertaking early warning reporting, and situation analysis, which feeds information into the decision making processes of the PSCâ (Lucey and Gida 2014). Central to all this is the contested understanding of the concept of peacebuilding. For policy makers as well as experts in African conflict management frameworks, the concept has remained fluid and seems to generically encompass prevention, mediation, peace support operations, and post-conflict reconstruction, thereby begging for an appreciation of what exactly South Africaâs interventions have constituted in countries where they have invested human and financial capital. Using the examples of Burundi and the DRC, this sub-section does not just identify the nature of South African interventions with the view of appraising the distinction between such interventions and those previously undertaken or concurrently undertaken by traditional peacebuilding actors. This distinction is further critical in relation to various platforms and instruments used by South Africa to implement their peacebuilding engagements, and is presented in two main sections with the first focusing on what peacebuilding is conceived to be in South African policy circles and the motivation for intervention and the second identifying the tangibles of peacebuilding."

As Comfort et al. recall: Some cities do better in the face of disaster than others.

Resilience then becomes the synonym for survival and the prescribed antidote for administrative shortcomings. This is too simple (â¦) Far from a ï¬x-it-and-forget-it approach, resilience is the outcome of a long-term process, enduring resilience is a balancing act between risk and resources, between vulnerabilities and escalating or unmanageable risk [75]: 272â273."
118,472,0.329,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Abstract In this chapter, the biological effects of exposure to radiation are summarized and explained from the perspective of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. First, a series of fundamental concepts in radiation biology are addressed to define the different types and sources of ionizing radiation, and resulting paths of human exposure. The health effects prompted by exposure to radiation are then broadly categorized and correlated with the nature of exposure and its extent. Finally, those concepts are revisited to assess the potential health impacts and risks endured by the workers and general population affected by the uncontrolled release of radiation around the Fukushima area. In the wake of the 2011 accident, a surge of public concern over the safety of nuclear energy and potential health risks from radiation exposure has re-surfaced. To evaluate, understand, and mitigate those health risks, it is essential that scientific data be meticulously gathered, rigorously analyzed, and accurately communicated. Taking a systematic knowledge-based approach to accurately capture the risks of exposure to radiation will not only alleviate mass confusion, but also help public health officials and emergency responders better prepare and implement logistics, should another such unfortunate event take place. The topics discussed in this chapter are intended to provide basic tools for understanding how health effects and risks related to radiation exposure are evaluated.

And the kind of luck that Cliff was experiencing seemed âfar too rareâ (p. 41). Actually, the unexpected findings function like a litmus test. Whereas Marion and Robin (but this also applies to Feng) remain sceptical and impassive, as really converted scientific subjects should, Sandy and Cliff allow their desire (for truth and funding respectively) to resurge. And now that Sandy suddenly finds âvalueâ in Cliffâs work (p. 40), Cliffâs positions changes radically, from âfailureâ to âsuccessâ: like âa man in Stalinist Russia, suddenly rehabilitatedâ (p. 40). A divide begins to unfold in the lab between the sceptics (Marion, mildly sceptical, and Robin, increasingly sceptical) and the believers (Sandy and Cliff), with Feng staying completely neutral.4 Cliff and Sandy find encouragement in the fact that the virus begins to take effect, that the experimental mice are in remission, and that there is a âmeasurable differenceâ (p. 58) compared to the control group. Indeed, âsomehow in all the mess of experimental ambiguityâ they may have âstumbled upon something trueâ (p. 58). And Sandy, somewhat prematurely no doubt, begins to compose his grant proposal âpoetryâ. For Cliff, the name R-7 becomes the signifier of redemption. He experiences âutter joyâ, realizing (while holding his results âby the taleâ) âthat heâd finally gotten what he wantedâ (p. 67). From now on, he sees nothing but his naked mice, although they are actually a screen or window into something more essential, more noumenal and biochemical (R-7). After killing six mice and opening their bodies, he is struck by the beauty of their blood vessels, undisturbed by cancer: Over and over het looked, and each time he made the discovery again: his virus worked on cancer cells. He had never seen anything more beautiful or more important than the mouse before him on the table. He had never felt so solemn or so full of joy (p. 69)."
383,44,0.329,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"FIGURE 1.2: Risk management. In contexts where risks are always harmful, risk management aims to reduce or prevent risks. In the safety field, it aims to protect employees, the general public, the environment, and company assets, while avoiding business interruptions (e.g. nuclear power stations can only have harmful risks, also the sight of a person can only get worse). For organizations whose definition of risk includes upside (some positive outcome) as well as downside (negative outcome) risks, risk management is as much about identifying opportunities as avoiding or mitigating losses. It then involves getting the right balance between innovation and change on the one hand, and avoidance of shocks and crises on the other (e.g. value of a house can quite randomly go up or down). Risk assessment is a systematic approach consisting of two components: (1) risk analysis i.e. recognising, characterising, and recording risks, this can include identifying the causes and their potential consequences, (2) risk evaluation i.e. evaluating the risk significance, in order to support decisions about how to manage them. In safety contexts, where risk sources are known as hazards, this step is known as hazard identification."

378,55,0.329,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"From an ecosystem perspective, the main question for the SES camp could be summarized thus: how can we best understand sustainable human societies and apply system innovations to achieve them? Important institutional research in this ï¬eld is carried out at the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Stockholm, Sweden, and also the STEPS Centre in Brighton, United Kingdom. One report that made signiï¬cant waves in Germany was the WBGUâs 2011 World in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability. The WBGU was founded just before the 1992 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development with the mandate of providing independent scientiï¬c advice. A key idea promoted by the WBGU in an earlier report was that of âplanetary guard railsâ similar to the âPlanetary Boundariesâ introduced by RockstrÃ¶m et al. (2009). While acknowledging other environmental domains and their overuse, the main emphasis of both the WBGU guard rails and the 2011 transition or transformation report (the German title uses âTransformationâ but the English translation is âtransitionâ) lies on climate change (WBGU 2011a). Overall, the single most important issue and overarching goal of the different measures and strategies discussed, is the avoidance of catastrophic climate change with all its implications for âthe worldâs ecosystems and their ability to sustain human life.â Given the wide-reaching consequences of the carbon cycle for life on earth, a transformation toward âclimate complianceâ is declared an âethical imperativeâ similar to that of the abolition of slavery and child labor (WBGU 2011c: 1). Climate change is introduced as the most important environmental global challenge and the report discusses other global megatrends in order to understand interlinkages: economic development; democratization; global energy supply and demand; urbanization; and patterns of increasing competition for land use between food, bio-energy and forests. It also seeks to identify how these and ecological earth system trends interrelate. As a result, the three areas with the highest transformative impact are identiï¬ed. These are the sustainable design of future energy systems, urbanization trends, and land use patterns. The programmatic gist of these required transformations is to turn current carbon-based economies into ones based on renewable, or at least recyclable resources. The magnitude of this remodeling is"

Obviously, this new framework enhanced by molecular biology and metagenomics will maintain biological signiï¬cance and usefulness as long as molecular proxies will remain related to species concepts, taxon names and classiï¬cations linking to the wider biological knowledge (Mace 2004; German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina 2014). The peril to invest only in an isolated and blind molecular database was already keenly emphasized by many taxonomists at the occasion of the rise of the barcoding initiative (e.g., Will et al. 2005). Building the network between names, biological knowledge and molecular data is from far the biggest challenge of present-day systematics and other sciences of diversity, much beyond the molecular technical tour de force (Grandcolas et al. 2013). We must keep in mind that this challenge takes place in a difï¬cult moment when discovery rates of species new to science do not decline (Tancoigne and Dubois 2013) but in a context of rising rates of extinction (RÃ©gnier et al. 2015)."

It is complemented by understanding the impact of human activity on ecosystems. Ecological thinking can be improved through ecological education. Improvement of ecological thinking, and understanding the impact of human activity on ecosystems, will eventually lead to increased awareness regarding environmental risk. An ecological education project was therefore conducted with secondary school students as subjects to effect an improvement in their ecological thinking."
118,4,0.329,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"said (mostly by nuclear engineers) that the Fukushima Daiichi accident is a good demonstration of the effectiveness of the defense-in-depth concept. While it is true that there were no deaths due to radiation from the accident, more than one thousand people died during the evacuation and while living in temporary housing as a result of various causes that were triggered by the evacuation. In addition to these deaths, thousands of families, local communities, and industries were damaged or completely destroyed. On a national scale, Japan is experiencing difficult and complicated situations in international relations and economics. On a global scale, carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere increased significantly. These consequences should have been properly analyzed, discussed in public, and prepared for prior to the accident, but there had been serious oversight and misunderstanding about what harms must be protected against in such a severe accident. This insufficient preparedness has been compounded by the lack of an effective decisionmaking process with participation from a broad range of stakeholders, resulting in intolerable delays in societal recovery after the accident. Numerous cases can be found in which decisions led to greater injury due to lack of timely decisionmaking informed by solid scientific evaluation of various risks, including those of low-dose radiation. The bitter reality is that severe nuclear accidents will occur in the future, no matter how advanced nuclear technologies become; we just do not know when, where, and how they will occur. Of course, we should continue our efforts to improve technologies toward minimizing the frequency and consequences of accidents as discussed in detail in Chap. 12, but, in addition, we should develop effective aftermath management for enabling swift recovery. Scientific and academic communities should start efforts for establishing the scientific bases, both natural and social, for better societal resilience. Naturally, as a part of such efforts, the education of nuclear engineering professionals at the college and graduate levels must be reinvented. In fact, to some extent, the team responsible for the present book had shared this recognition in advance of the accident, and efforts had been started before 2011, as Chaps. 1 and 21 describe in detail. For the 4 years (2007â2010) prior to the accident, the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Management at the University of Tokyo and the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley had already started a collaboration called GoNERI for developing advanced educational programs for nuclear engineering. The collaboration was funded by the Global Center-of-Excellence (G-COE) program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences (JSPS). GoNERI was motivated by the particular relevance and importance of social-scientific approaches to various crucial aspects of nuclear technology, such as the nuclear fuel cycle, radioactive waste disposal, implementation in rising countries, etc. Therefore, special emphasis was placed on integrating nuclear science and engineering with social science. However, at the same time, it was also recognized that we did not yet have sufficient command of the fundamentals of the social sciences (such as their domain, concepts, terminology, methodology, etc.), which limits nuclear engineers"

Through collaboration toward common goals, business can address some of the critical environmental and social problems the world faces while strengthening their own resilience to global challenges. Different types of business solutions can be generated. Main conditions for them are to be impactful, measurable, scalable, replicable and beyond business-as-usual. Scalable means that they can have a meaningful impact on the world. Replicable enables them to be applied by many companies, in multiple sectors, regions and countries. Measurable is important to know how they are making a difference. Beyond business as usual businesses and governments begin to work â and collaborate â differently. In sum, the initiatives are good for business, so they have a commercial logic that contributes to the broader good and to the bottom line (WBCSD 2015, Vision 2020). Action2020 is the WBCSD platform for sustainability in action. It is the roadmap for how business can positively influence environmental and social trends while strengthening their own resilience to issues like climate change, demographic dynamics and skills shortages. Based on the latest scientific consensus, action 2020 sets an agenda for business to take action on sustainable development to 2020 and beyond. LCA tools, eco-efficiency analysis and other LCM tools and approaches can support the basic needs for the development towards more sustainable solutions in the market with scientific sound, detailed and meaningful information quite efficiently and will be used more intensively in the future. The collaboration between different stakeholders in the market will help to make significant improvements and foster more sustainable solutions. Analytical tools as LCA can support decision-making,"

We emphasise the practicalities of eating and drinking as social processes, undertaken in households and communities, besides the more abstract approaches to food and water taken by food scientists or hydrologists. Without underestimating the power of agri-food corporations and global trade agreements in shaping contemporary food systems, we emphasise the agency of ordinary people in meeting the daily challenges of âfeeding the familyâ (De Vault 1991). We also focus on the challenges involved in managing water which enables food to be grown, for families to have their right to water met for drinking, cooking, sanitation and survival needs, and for societies to access water that enables them to flourish and develop. As with the other publications in this series, we emphasise the links between bio-physical and socio-cultural processes, and the connections between different geographical scales, from the most local decisions taken at household level to the (Footnote 5 continued) treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966.

233,102,0.328,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Introduction There is mounting evidence that we are entering a sixth mass extinction (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005), and the future of biodiversity is at risk due to the high rates at which biological diversity â species, habitats, evolutionary diversity â is being eroded. Species are experiencing unprecedented pressures across their ranges owing to global change, including increased invasion success of aliens (Winter et al. 2009), habitat destruction (Vitousek et al. 1997; Haberl et al. 2007), climate change and climate variability (Willis et al. 2008, 2010). Consequently, approximately 30 % of assessed species are currently categorised as threatened by the IUCN, and a greater proportion may be committed to extinction in the near future (Thomas et al. 2004). Current rates of species loss might be 1,000â10,000 times greater than past extinction rates (Pimm et al. 1995; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) with particularly elevated rates in tropical biomes (Vamosi and Vamosi 2008), known for their unique life-form diversity. At the ecosystem level, with the loss of species, we also lose their contributions to overall ecosystem functioning and services. The loss of ecosystem services is of particular concern because human survival relies strongly on key services such as food production, plant pollination, medicinal plants, clean water, clean air, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, climate stability, recreation, tourism, etc. â which are provided by a well functioning system of biological diversity. It is well established that human activities can drive extinctions within a short period of time (Baillie et al. 2004; Mace et al. 2005a). Because human population has increased exponentially over the last centuries, and is expected to reach nine billion by 2050 (www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/2004worldpo p2300reportï¬nalc.pdf), pressure on natural ecosystems is also predicted to increase, yet at the same time there will be an even greater demand for the ecosystem services provided by biologically diverse natural systems. As a result, the rate of species extinction is projected to rise by at least a further order of magnitude over the next few hundred years (Mace et al. 2005b), potentially decreasing the provisioning of ecosystem services at a time when demand is growing. Understanding how the ongoing extinction crisis will impact the provisioning of critical ecosystem services is therefore a matter of urgency. Quantifying the ecosystem contributions of individual species is a major challenge. Current estimates of global diversity vary by over an order of magnitude (see e.g. May 2010), with the vast majority of species (86 % and 91 % of terrestrial and oceanic diversity, respectively) remaining unknown to science (Mora et al. 2011). An in-depth understanding of species ecologies is therefore impractical for most of life; at best, we might be able to infer their placement on the tree-of-life. Whilst there is now a general consensus on the positive link between biodiversity and ecosystem function (Hooper et al. 2012), there has been growing evidence suggesting that evolutionary history provides a more informative measure of biological diversity than traditional metrics based upon richness and abundance (e.g. Faith 1992; Faith et al. 2010; Davies and Cadotte 2011; see also Srivastava et al. 2012 for a comprehensive review). It is suggested that evolutionary history might better capture"
75,424,0.328,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","Pop Science, Self-Marketing, and Veriï¬ability On account of its proximity to citizens and its public character, crowdfunding also bears the inherent danger of unduly popularizing research, especially if any individual may donate to a project. Even though internal platforms for crowdfunding in which only researchers can donate to a project proposal may develop faster, it is conceivableâas with the peer review in traditional fundingâthat mainstream research is favored. Some also suspect that crowdfunding, but also social payments, could establish a disproportionate preference of applied research over basic research (Giles 2012, p. 253). The same could also be suspected for popular science or science that lends itself easily to media portrayal. Crowdfunding, social payments, and virtual currencies place new demands on researchersâ self-marketing (Ledford 2012), but these demands need not be a bad thing, since a clear, succinct, and understandable presentation of a project proposal can only enhance and augment the verifiability and testability of scientific concepts by eliminating the dense prose and difficult wording found in many funding applications (language that is often mandated by fundersâ requirements), thus promoting the intersubjective verifiability of scientific concepts called for by science theory and philosophy of science. A more solid grounding in the scientific community might be achieved if crowdfunding, social payments and virtual currencies were not applied in entirely open contexts, but rather only within scientific communities (if necessary under the umbrella of discipline-specific associations or learned societies). In such a scenario, however, the aspect of involvement of civic society would be lost."
192,203,0.328,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In the early twentieth century, group behaviour had become an urgent topic. Societies were becoming mass societies; modern media were creating mass audiences; politics had become the domain of mass movements; and even science itself was expanding in scope and scale: new universities were established and new types of scientific institutions were founded (such as the Rockefeller Institute, founded in 1901). The question how to manage and organise large groups was not a purely academic one. In Arrowsmith we see a chronic tension/collision between two types of groups (two types of callings), highly dependent on one another, and yet apparently mutually exclusive, namely (impure) medical practice and basic (pure) research. For Martin, there are many incentives for choosing a medical career: the income and respectability of the profession, the possibility of marriage and of upward social mobility, in combination with the public acknowledgement of its relevance. Yet, what is lacking, to a deplorable extent, are inspiring personalities. One by one the fatherâfigures in Lewisâs novel (representing medicine and public health) are ridiculed as hypocrites, endorsing unsubstantiated claims and leading uninspiring lives. On top of that, Martin himself is not a good physician at all, lacking âbedside mannersâ and communicative skills, while his drinking habits are symptomatic of his ambivalence: his repressed yearning for pure inquiry. Gottlieb, by contrast, seems to stand out as a beacon of integrity, a scientific prophet, a window into the future. Their first meetings give rise to âimprintingâ, as it were. No matter how hard Martin tries to ârepressâ his admiration for his hero, his exposure to Gottlieb prevents him from developing a wholeâhearted commitment to medical practice. Indeed, although he had âgiven up Gottliebâworship and his yearning for the laboratory â¦ something of Gottliebâs spirit remainedâ (p. 115). Having mesmerised Martin during his lectures, and subsequently during the laboratory hours they spent together, Gottlieb continues to draw Martin towards him.7 Gottlieb considers âmedical scienceâ a contradiction in terms. He is a genuine scientist, devoting his life to intellectual aspirations, willing to work excessively hard and to accept the risk of failure. Martin is in awe of Gottlieb, the ideal âfather figureâ he is looking for (Parry 2008, p. vii), an egoâideal or intellectual conscience, encouraging him to work harder. Indeed, Gottlieb âindoctrinates him into the religion of a scientistâ (p. viii). Already during the very first lecture he attends, a rapport is established, and Martin identifies himself with his lifeâlong mentor. The novel describes how, at the beginning of the lecture, Professor Max Gottlieb is about to assassinate a guinea pig with anthrax germs, displaying his masterful technical dexterity, claiming that âtechnique is the beginning of all scienceâ (p. 36). As Lewis phrases it, the class was âa mobâ (p. 35), âshudderingâ (p. 36) in response to the idea that even a small sample of anthrax bacilli could easily produce a lethal infection. But Martin is simply enthralled by Gottlieb. Indeed: âMartin Arrowsmith already saw himself doing the same experiment and, as he remembered Gottliebâs unerring fingers, his hands curved in imitation â¦ He had begun, perhaps in youthful imitation of Gottlieb, to"

214,274,0.328,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Climate observations and climate projections provide a background for discussion. Essential in the application was evaluation of local weather processes and whether or not models represented these processes. This helped to develop trust of the expert guidance to interpret model information. Attention is naturally drawn to recent extreme events and whether or not these extremes are consistent with projections, for example, more precipitation occurring in extreme events. Warm and dry spells in the winter and spring that alter greening of forests, followed by damaging cold, is another example. Convolution of climate, extreme events, and ecological responses sit at the foundation of plausible futures. For example, if there is large-scale disruption offorests by drought, ï¬re, or wind that leads to the death of many trees, then the future forest will be recovering in a much different mean climate than in which it originally evolved. Since Isle Royaleâs forests are at the southern extent of the subarctic (or boreal) forest, and that extent may well move northward in a warmer climate, it is unlikely that a boreal forest disrupted by drought, ï¬re, or wind will be regenerated. Given the importance of speciï¬c tree species to moose food supply, this would be a negative indicator for moose populations. Evaluation of the combined influence of climate drivers was largely negative for maintaining the wolf-moose ecosystem. Though climate change is only part of the portfolio of factors in the decision-making package, it demonstrates that in the future it will be even more difï¬cult to sustain this precarious ecosystem. A driving conclusion from this exercise is the need to plan for best possible futures rather than manage toward preservation or conservation of the past."
73,713,0.328,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"As a general rule in relation to disasters, a major difference between the response in developing countries and developed countries is that in developing countries, fatalities dominate. In developed countries, infrastructure and property losses dominate. In relation to food issues, a major disaster in a developing country, such as a large scale drought, wildï¬re, or extensive ï¬ood has the potential to lead to famine whereas an analogous disaster in a developed country will lead to price increases (Fig. 26.2)."
278,297,0.328,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Two words in this question require further explanation: âimpactsâ and âembodiedâ. The term âimpactâ is used here in a very wide sense, comprising both pressure and impact indicators as defined by the causal DPSIR framework (Driving ForcesPressures-State-Impacts-Responses) that describes interactions between society and the environment.2 Environmental pressures include the use of resources, such as land, water or materials as well as the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) or pollutants. In the stricter definition provided by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards (ISO 2006; Hellweg et al. 2014), environmental impacts represent the (actual or potential) damage exerted by pressures, e.g. global warming, toxicity or biodiversity loss. Especially in the context of international trade, the expression environmental âburdenâ or âloadâ has been used as well as âburden shiftingâ (e.g. Giljum and Eisenmenger 2008; SchÃ¼tz et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2013) or âdisplacement of pressuresâ (e.g. Steen-Olsen et al. 2012) to describe the change of location where environmental pressures or impacts occur when resources from other countries are used indirectly through trade. For social and economic indicators, the distinction between pressures and impacts is less well defined. For the sake of simplicity, the term âimpactâ has been used for all indicators in this chapter (see also Table 8.1). The word âembodiedâ describes indirect impacts that can be âattributed toâ, are âassociated withâ or are âembedded inâ activities that are not directly linked to the impacts. In the context of trade, consuming a product in one country can lead to impacts in many other countries, depending on where the production and supply chain processes occur that are required to produce the final consumer product.

Recent reviews (Vance-Borland and Holley 2011; Mills et al. 2014) suggest that polycentric networks in which multiple, heterogeneous subgroups are linked by bridging ties maintain the greatest diversity of response options. Each subgroup has high within-group cohesion so is characterized by dense linkages (high degree centrality, strong or bonding ties) among people sharing specific knowledge that work together productivelyâenhancing knowledge development (Bodin et al. 2006; Bodin and Crona 2009). Within the network as a whole, there are multiple subgroups, which differ in the knowledge areas and expertise (subgroup diversityâ Newman and Dale 2007), developing the diversity of knowledge held by the network as a whole (Bodin et al. 2006; Ernstson et al. 2008; Bodin and Crona 2009; SandstrÃ¶m and Rova 2010). Such functional diversity enhances network adaptability and resilience (Newman and Dale 2007; Mills et al. 2014), cultivates creativity (Aslan et al. 2014) and obviates internal turf battles in large networks (Reuf et al. 2003). Critical to network success are bridging relationships (actors with high betweenness centrality) among the diverse subgroups to promote sharing of expert knowledge and counter tendencies toward subgroup homophily. Network sustainability and adaptability are further enhanced if there are connections to actors outside the network (peripheral actors) who hold specialized knowledge, skills, or resources. Put simply, we can identify four network characteristics"

10,215,0.328,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"success supports the coherence of actions relevant to water management at the catchment scale. Regarding the common perception of problems and goals ambitions, the very positive consensus on water management can be assessed by the fact of general acceptance, i.e. the acceptance, by all stakeholders representing the various water uses, of the priority given to drinking water. The availability of water provided by the dam supports this priority. However, the perception of the risk of drought and the potential impacts on freshwater availability is almost absent for the majority of stakeholders. This can be explained by the more frequent flooding issues in the area, which was, in particular, observed during the period of interviews in connection with the floods that occurred in Brittany early in 2014. As there is no comprehensive information about the quantity of water withdrawn by all water users, water managers are not really able to implement a truly coherent policy by soliciting coherent strategy and instruments. Moreover, the SAGE is a compromise between stakeholders, and some of them are more organized than others. As a result, some interests are taken into account more than others, especially those related to the drinking water supply. Furthermore, despite the work being conducted to integrate agricultural regulation in the WFD, agricultural policy is still declared by local stakeholders to be too thoroughly disconnected from the other instruments in the catchment due to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), which is decided at the European level and is not linked directly with water policy at the local level. A coherent implementation of strategy and instruments is, thus, hard to ï¬nd for water management as a whole in the area and even harder for drought management. The responsibilities of each actor with regard to the WFD are not obvious. Most actors think that the responsibility lies mainly in the hands of the State services as represented by the Water Agency. Most water users are not considering the link between their activities and water resource management. In fact, the LWCâs responsibility is to be a decision-making authority, but it has neither the ï¬nancial nor the technical means to implement decisions, so it has no resources to implement the plan of actions proposed. At the scale of the Arzal dam and its reservoir, the ï¬nancial and technical aspects are provided by the IAV. At a more local level, we observe that some municipalities do not have the means to ï¬nance 20 % of the budget for the implementation of local projects related to water even if the subsidies, as those coming from the Water Agency, cover the remaining 80 %."

284,56,0.328,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Popular environmentalism Governmental and international debates over new environmental policies occurred at the same time that a debate emerged in civil society which quickly grew stronger. Inï¬uenced by the new ideas of Liberation Theology and different social movements in the region, a widely shared critique of the economic growth models in Latin America would give voice to a popular environmentalism, or the environmentalism of the poor. It drew from the ideas of two important Latin American thinkers. Paulo Freire emphasized social and environmental justice, local knowledge, the morality of political decisions, and respect for the planet and its diverse habitats. These ideas led some to adopt a fundamental rejection of capitalism; others regarded it as an agenda that was more cultural and moral, and which could present an alternative to materialist developmentalism. The other thinker with great inï¬uence in the debate was the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano. In his 1971 book Open Veins of Latin America (Las Venas Abiertas de AmÃ©rica Latina), he presented a ferocious critique of the extractivist logic throughout all of Latin Americaâs history. The book became an iconic text in the debates over the consequences of extractive capitalism and the social and ecological destruction in the region. In recent years another Uruguayan, Eduardo Gudynas (2009), attracted many followers for his elaboration of âpostextractivismâ. Meanwhile, Maristella Svampa leads a ï¬ourishing group of Argentinean authors doing excellent political ecology research with"

166,38,0.328,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"4.2 Interdisciplinarity and the Need for Transparency At the start of this chapter we noted two defining features of the LIVES research programme besides the shared substantive goal of investigating the experience of vulnerability at different stages and key transitions of the life course. These features were its interdisciplinarity â both within and across the various individual projects involved â and a predominant emphasis on quantitative methods. Yet while the overriding methodological approach of the LIVES projects relies on survey data collection, variations in implementation can be observed as a result of deeply entrenched, unique methodological traditions of the different disciplines involved. Each discipline has its own toolbox, which is not purely technical but also acts as a lens through which to look at social phenomena, and to produce, manipulate and interpret data. Such âtraditionsâ are apparent when reading different journals,3 but most of the time they manifest themselves as strong but implicit rules governing the conduct of research within a given scientific field. In this book, as in the LIVES project more generally, there has been no attempt to obviate this reality. As a result of varied disciplinary priorities, the various projects described have inevitably paid more or less attention to different sources of error in their data, or emphasised different notions of quality over others. One example of this concerns measurement, where it is not just that the questions asked of respondents in different disciplines can differ, but also that the priorities, in terms of design, can vary: for example, psychologists tend to privilege âvalidatedâ scales, often long, while sociologists tend to favour shorter multi-item measures. Similarly, the way in which household income is considered will often be different in economic models where exact values are seen as important, while in other"
222,87,0.328,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This research dynamically analyses the two most important ecosystem services in terms of livelihoods in the delta: agriculture (including aquaculture where appropriate Chap. 24) and fisheries (focusing on offshore capture fisheries Chap. 25) under future environmental change and management scenarios. The area and species distribution of the Sundarbans mangrove forest are also modelled with a preliminary assessment of ecosystem services including protection against storm surges (Chap. 26). These three key provisioning services were operationalised using seven social-ecological systems, defined as freshwater and brackish aquaculture, irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, riverine and char environments, the coastal zone and the Sundarbans dependent zone (see Chap. 22, Adams et al. 2013, 2016). The social-ecological system classification recognises that although in certain regions a specific type of service may dominate livelihoods, households usually have more than one type of income source and that these sources may change through the year depending on the character of the ecosystem (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 2010). Households select different ecosystem services from within the bundle at different times of the year. Social-ecological systems are thus the result of human activities to mediate the negative impacts of environmental variability and to manage bundles of ecosystem services (MartÃ­n-LÃ³pez et al. 2012). Social systems dictate the rules of access to resources and influence the winners and losers of trade-offs between different benefits (Walker et al. 2004), ultimately affecting the relationship between ecosystem service dependence and poverty outcomes. The relationship between ecosystem services and poverty changes because social mechanisms and other factors co-vary with bundles of ecosystem services. For example, the presence of opportunities for supplementing incomes with open access resources (e.g. fisheries, forest products), land ownership, opportunities for sharecropping and leasing land, agricultural labour, access to off-farm income opportunities, the level of exposure to extreme events, the impacts of cyclones and storm"

365,56,0.327,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"IAASTD 2009). The social impacts have been the subject of much debate. On the one hand the expansion of food production and lowering of food prices a major benefit to the consumers, particularly the poor (Pingali 2012). On the other hand, the model of a top down technology delivery focussed primarily on favorable production areas, excluded many of the poorest from its benefits. Sustainable agriculture is part of the larger concept of sustainable development that according to the Brundtland Commission is a development strategy that aims to ensure that future generations would not be worse off compared to the present generation. Sustainable development contains economic, social, and environmental elements, but in principle has limited restrictions on technology, per se, and the use of technologies are judged based on their impacts. Zilberman (2014) argues that one of the major features of sustainable development is the emphasis on conservation technologies that enhance input use efficiency and reduce pollution, introduction of strategies that include resilience and ability to withstand environmental risk, adoption of recycling technologies, and transition from non-renewable to renewable technologies. Renewable technologies include both energy production using solar and wind as well as extension of the bioeconomy, which relies on biological processes to produce food, fuel, and fine chemicals. This approach to sustainable development that allows some substitution among resources and encourages production systems that enhance human welfare subject to constraints should have bearing on the definition of CSA. The CSA approach is criticized by some advocates of alternative development models, because it does not explicitly exclude the use of manufactured capital inputs and while incorporating participatory and bottom up approaches, it also allows for integration of science-based technology transfers. The CSA literature does however explicitly call for enhancing the complementarity between ecosystem services and manufactured capital, such as improving soil quality to enhance the productivity gains from inorganic fertilizer use, improving livestock breeds to enhance their feed conversion efficiency, or planting trees in agricultural landscapes to reduce flood risks. The issue of biotechnology use in agriculture is perhaps the most highly contested, with most of the focus on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The use of GMOs has been limited to few crops, used mostly for fiber (cotton) and feed and oil (maize, soybean, canola) with limited use for direct human consumption (papaya, maize, canola). Furthermore, while adoption of GMOs on farm has been quite broad in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa, and in cotton in other major countries (India, China), its use in Europe and most of Africa has been limited or even practically banned. Most major national academies of science and international organizations have argued that it poses no new health risks compared to other sources of food, and there is evidence that GMOs have reduced the price of major agricultural commodities as well as the extent of GHG emissions (Barrows et al. 2014). There is also significant evidence that it has improved the well-being of poor farmers, especially in cotton production (KlÃ¼mper and Qaim 2014; Qaim 2015)."

Empirical findings from the lab or even from one deliberative discussion to another do not always easily generalize. Science, technology, and society (STS) scholars generally agree that public engagement should be context sensitive (Delgado, KjÃ¸lberg, & Wickson, 2011), making it important to examine the impact of design factors within specific, concrete contexts. As part of our strategy for connecting features, processes, and outcomes, we held context as constant as possible across our experiments. While our approach necessarily limits the generalizability of results, it provides a solid foundation for establishing the existence of internally valid and robust results within our chosen context, before extending to others. As the reader will see in Chaps. 3, 4, and 5, even with all the controls we employed, finding consistent effects was, nonetheless, no small feat. The contextual features held constant in our studies include the type of participants involved, the topics of deliberation, and the use of a longitudinal, repeated measures design."

Their work is presented as a critique of economic theories, including neoclassical and neo-Darwinian theories which fail, in the authorsâ views, to capture the role played by âpurposeful human actionâ. The same critique could be levelled at the concept of âautomatic behaviourâ represented in the COM-b model. Along with most of the evolutionary economics literature and the contributions to the discussion on capabilities from organisational and management studies, this work is targeted on innovation processes taking place within organisations with an implicit focus on the context of the âï¬rmâ (i.e. private, market-oriented, for-proï¬t, organisations) and economic systems change.

Most of the discussion in this book so far has concerned the scientiï¬c credibility of climate models. Salience requires that the information be relevant to a practitionerâs problem. More than legitimacy and credibility, this chapter is concerned with salience or relevance, which is difï¬cult to establish. Relevance or salience often brings forward the need for the evaluation of the data from climate model projections. This is evaluation beyond that performed in modeling centers and through scientiï¬c research papers. The characteristics of this evaluation are, often, that it is highly local, is application speciï¬c, and uses different variables (derived indices) than provided or evaluated by modeling centers. An example might be taking temperature or maximum temperature and estimating heat waves, or the stream flow in a particular river. The evaluation requires linking past performance with interpretations of the future. Just because a model reproduces the global average temperature or precipitation, that does not mean that the model reproduces the important characteristics of precipitation (frequency and intensity) at a particular location. Further evaluation is often necessary to evaluate models as ï¬t for a particular purpose. This evaluation step in the application of model data is necessary enough that model-data providers should conceive their data as the start of further evaluation rather than just focusing on the practitionerâs direct application of the data."
87,165,0.327,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","example, if the perceived challenge is located in the agricultural production sphere predominantly, then agronomists and farm economists might be the first ones to be involved but also farmers. If in contrast, the perceived challenge is located in the technological procedure of integrating new materials into known construction processes, construction engineers and material processing experts might be involved at first hand. Next question then could be how the market would react, so that marketing experts and potential consumers would be required. From these short considerations, it becomes evident that a range of actors has to be included in order to obtain a more complete understanding of a problem situation. And consequently, an interdependency is revealed between the actors describing the research problem and the way it is perceived and embedded into causeâeffect relations and the expected results and outcomes of the study. Summarising, the very first challenge of inter- and transdisciplinary research is to frame a problem appropriately and to unite a group of scientists (and other actors) whose composition is sufficiently broad and deep in its expertise to generate meaningful answers. In transdisciplinary studies, such a straight problem orientation has proven an effective instrument for successful identification and mobilisation of stakeholders (Knierim 2014). So, once the problem isâat least initiallyâ encircled and a number of concerned actors identified, the second and consecutive challenge of the first research phase is to set up the teamâs collaboration and to concretely implement the cooperation. In other words, how to practise a working procedure that allows both individual and group performances, so that the expertise of all actors involved can unfold? What exactly will be studied and how? What will be the responsibilities and tasks of the various actors? How will the results be determined? Clearly, these skills cannot be learned through books or taught in lectures but require a reflexive learning-bydoing approach. One basis for such skills can be a targeted team work training where steps of an action-oriented research process are practised"

9,745,0.327,"One Hundred Years of Chemical Warfare : Research, Deployment, Consequences","This verse by Horace not only served during the First World War to stimulate the enthusiasm for the war. It is also the title of a poem by Wilfred Owen, which ends with the cry âthe old lie!â Owen himself was killed as a young British volunteer just one week before the end of the war. It was not only young men who were enthusiastic about the war in those days but also a large fraction of the university teachers and scientists. Among them was Fritz Haber with his maxim: âIn peace for mankind, in war for the fatherland,ââa philosophy that he adopted also for his institute, the recently founded Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut fÃ¼r Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie, to which he had been appointed ï¬rst director in 1911. Two years earlier Haber had made his most important scientiï¬c discovery while still professor at the Technical University of Karlsruhe. While today, climate and energy are the greatest problems for mankind for which solutions are expected to come from science, in those days it was the need for food. As a consequence of progress in technology and medicine, the world population was growing so rapidly during the nineteenth century that, unless crops could be increased considerably by the development of artiï¬cial fertilizers, there was a great danger of famine. In a worldwide competition it was Fritz Haber who succeeded in 1909 in his laboratory to produce ammonia from nitrogen (from air) and hydrogen, which then could be readily converted into nitrogen fertilizers (âbread from airâ). This reaction was then transferred within a surprisingly short period into a large-scale industrial process, now known as the Haber-Bosch process, by Carl Bosch and Alwin Mittasch at the BASF company, which started production in 1913. At present about 140 million tons of ammonia are produced this way every year, of which 90% are converted G.

376,668,0.327,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","brucellosis in red deer (Cervus elaphus) declined as a result of control efforts in livestock (Serrano et al. 2011). In these cases the wildlife populations were not competent disease reservoirs, failing to sustain the infection without co-circulation through livestock. In cases where wildlife populations are competent reservoir hosts, control efforts are complicated by social, logistical, and ecological factors (e.g., Donnelly et al. 2006). Culling and increased hunting of wildlife are often proposed to control wildlife diseases but they are seldom effective. First, it might be difficult to achieve the necessary hunter participation to create large reductions in host density (e.g., Heberlein 2004). Many hunters will want to maintain high densities to maximize their future hunting opportunities. Second, the cost of culling wildlife, particularly in a test and cull strategy, can be very high and so is only applicable to localized operations (Wolfe et al. 2004). One of the rationales for culling wildlife is that disease transmission might be positively correlated with host density (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). Although plausible, this assumption is not always supported by data and even if transmission is density-dependent, culling can have adverse consequences. For example, culling badgers (Meles meles) to control bovine tuberculosis in Britain causes the disease to spread even further due to social disruption, with surviving badgers roaming more widely to find mates (Bielby et al. 2014). In addition, increased hunting in regions of easy access might locally aggregate wildlife in areas of limited hunter access even if the regional density declines. Part of the problem, at least for diseases that can be transmitted back and forth between livestock and wildlife, is that disease control measures used on wildlife are based on those developed for livestock. Therein lies a mismatch in spatial scale, because livestock can be intensively managed within fences at the ranch scale but wildlife populations are free-ranging at the landscape scale (Bienen and Tabor 2006). There is also a mismatch in temporal scale because disease eradication campaigns are typically continuous for livestock but in wildlife they can be tactically scheduled to take advantage of episodic natural disturbances. For example, in the Kruger ecosystem of South Africa, buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in herds with a higher prevalence of bovine tuberculosis lose condition faster during dry seasons (Caron et al. 2003). It follows that any attempts to minimize the disease in the buffalo population should be reserved for immediately after droughts, which occur about once per decade. That is when die-offs of 50 % or more leave a smaller population size to contend with, and presumably a much reduced proportion of infected animals (du Toit 2010). For rangelands in particular, progress in reducingâor at least accommodatingâthe risks of wildlife-borne diseases to livestock will depend upon the better integration of veterinary practice and epidemiology with disease ecology. As a case in point, before brucellosis was virtually eradicated in cattle in the USA it was transmitted to elk (Cervus canadensis) and bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area, where it has repeatedly been transmitted back to cattle from elk (Rhyan et al. 2013). Free-ranging elk are now increasing in the area in which brucellosis is endemic and so the veterinary achievements in fighting the disease in livestock over the past 75 years must now be followed by ecologically based adaptive"

Water quality: Patterns and trends in water quality are highly variable in space and through time in the Gulf of Mexico, and coastal environments are highly influenced by human activities where the primary cause of degraded water quality is excess nutrients. Water quality rapidly improves with distance offshore. More than 60 % of assessed estuaries were either threatened or impaired for human use and/or aquatic life over the time period of this review that spans the 1990s to the mid-2000s. 2.

The characteristics of organisations and interactions (relations) will serve as discriminating factors for providing a better understanding of certain types of social innovations. Thus, by expanding the level of analysis and by allowing for comparative analyses, the database can strengthen and build the existing links between social innovation and social transformation. In this way, it will allow for a thorough examination of a central assumption of CRISES, namely that room for innovation and experimentation widens when the macro-social regulations (market, state, collective agreements) are in flux. In such a context, micro-systems can serve as places from which to identify the processes in which new social patterns emerge. By building clusters (Schumpeter, 1932; Porter, 1990) and by institutionalising along different logics, they can form systems and eventually shape new national trajectories of growth (Hollingsworth and Boyer, 1997; Strange, 1996; Crouch and Streeck, 1996)."
198,613,0.327,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"17.6.4 Limits and Possibilities of the WBI Approach Implementation in the Drought NLTA: Lessons to Be Remembered The implementation of the WBI pilot approach in the Drought NLTA program has raised some important points of discussion, in terms of methodological conclusions and contributions. â¢ Although relevant outcomes can happen in early implementation stages, programs framed as multi-stakeholder/multi-sector partnerships and strongly based on voluntary collaboration, such as the Drought NTLA, tend to take time to develop. The harvesting of significant outcomes will likely benefit from more implementation time. When the first harvesting was done (i.e., November 2014â January 2015), the program was in mid-term implementation phase. Results influenced by the program were starting to develop but were not yet ready to be reported as outcomes. â¢ The risk of having partners over-reporting positive outcomes to which the program has not truly contributed (e.g., to please the donor) can be overcome with rigorous methods. Triangulation of sources (combining document reviews, interviews, and other sources of information) and probing are extremely necessary. The framework provokes the analyst to do just that, by asking for evidence of the reported outcomes. â¢ Outcomes need to be interpreted taking the context into account (political environment, staff turnover, local and organizational culture, necessary support, etc.). Fostering partnerships needs respect for the various partnersâ capacities and their specific contexts. This principle allows the collaboration to generate outcomes that sometimes may be more realistic and more likely to be sustainable in the longer term than the planned, non-achieved outcomes. It is the case of the Piquet Carneiro DPP. While this plan did not define policy and management actions triggered as the drought progresses to higher stages, the plan was built through a broad consultation process, including discussions and the development of the plan proposal and intermediate validations with different stakeholders. As a result, it includes coherent and consistent management activities related to the preparation and risk reduction, and touches on response and disaster recovery for extreme drought effects in the municipality. It also provides a series of recommendations for institutional strengthening, adoption of management tools,"

It was also around this time that many began to sense that the material civilization that had supported the dramatic growth of the twentieth century had reached an impasse. People conscious of these matters began taking action in an effort to avoid the difficult state of affairs that the exhaustion of energy resources, global warming, the generation of large amounts of waste, and similar developments present. However, the data and information that provide the grounds for action were lacking, and discussion likewise had not yet reached a state of maturity. For people to take action requires them being able to believe that the actions they are attempting are correct and are being done for the worldâs sake. However, attempts to encourage recycling have been met with people expressing the view that it merely adds to costs and is unrealistic. Meanwhile, studies on the adoption of solar batteries have led some specialists to reject them, saying that the payoffs are not proportionate to the costs and the absolute amounts of energy achieved are insufficient.

341,222,0.326,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Approaches to Development Cooperation, and in 2009, the 19 organisations of the United Nations Development Group established the Human Rights Mainstreaming Mechanism (Baillat et al. 2013). Human rights also inspire citizens and states, as in Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe, to adopt new rights-based constitutions to shed the legal legacy of their colonial predecessors. As also reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global consensus is emerging on human values embodied in human and constitutional rights. This is undoubtedly the worldâs most influential normative value system and yardstick to steer global and national state interventions. These trends also provide fertile ground for rightsbased freshwater governance in the broad sense, including, but not limited to, a priority for water for drinking, personal and other domestic uses and sanitation alone. In the water sector, a growing number of human rights institutions, civil society organisations and researchers have conceptualised rights-based freshwater governance and have invoked human rights frameworks in action and litigation. For example, a call for wastewater management supported the realisation of the right to sanitation. Various national and global human rights institutions, especially in Latin America, exposed major water pollution and damage by mines and exclusion from any voluntary, informed and prior consent as violation of the human right to a clean environment (WaterLex 2014). In other cases, rights to a clean environment are invoked to justify a quantitative reservation of âenvironmental flowsâ. New issues have been raised pertaining to the duty of the state to ensure flood protection and prevent soil erosion (WaterLex 2014). The past two decades have also seen a strong global move towards participation, transparency, accountability and access to information or âfree, prior and informed consentâ. In some cases of large-scale investments in dams, for example, in Latin America, human rights to participation are invoked. However, others, such as the global Water Integrity Network, aim at transparency, accountability and participation in the water sector and combating corruption as values on their own, and reference to human rights is rare. A case that is raised as a human rights issue with far-reaching implications regards the nature of private water services providersâ obligations relating to disclosure of environmental information (WaterLex 2014). Duties of the state to realise constitutional rights and international human rights that it ratified also hold for two other core mandates of the state in freshwater governance. One is public infrastructure-based service provision for productive water uses, including agriculture, mining and industries. Water volumes used for productive purposes are much higher than for domestic uses; the latter represent at the most two to three percent of total water volumes used. The state is also the primary regulatory authority, not only with responsibilities to safeguard water quality as mentioned, but also responsible for the allocation of water quantities, often as the statutory custodian of the nationâs water resources. The importance of rights-based approaches in these two core tasks of states is increasingly recognised. The Water Governance Facility of the United Nations Development Programme at Stockholm International Water Institute (WGF 2012) emphasised precisely these domains: âHuman Rights Based Approaches can be"

92,157,0.326,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"The general direction of global health within academia seems to have moved to a stage where easily accessing information is vital to notions of transparency and interactions. The task of universities is to find and create pathways that inform society and our students about the realities of health across various nation states. While this might seem like a daunting task, the structure of Pan Institution Network for Global Health (PINGH) has provided avenues for exploring and addressing complex and interrelated health issues among global partners within an academic setting. This book provides a platform for unpacking both the success and challenges faced by individuals in the academy (students, faculty, and administrators) and the communities in which they work in the world of global health. Published chapters reveal a collection and dissemination of performance, networks, systems, and people that contribute to the PINGH network and its goals. PINGH in its rawest form is a moving collection of parts and people working to achieve the goal of formalizing a network that enables local and national actors to address some of the worldâs most pressing health issues. In coordination with local agencies, hospitals, universities, and other key individuals, the network provides a type of methodology for engagement and problem-solving. In addition to hands-on engagement and experiences, the PINGH network serves as a space for nurturing and developing ideas. The network provides a domain for those who wish to test ideas or brings together like minds to address global health issues, while also creating pathways to the inclusion of diverse individuals, sectors of society, and communities in this complex and fast-paced field.

72,174,0.326,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Innovations in regulations and rights Creating flexible forms of ad hoc support that meet newly emerging risks Increasingly, patterns of working and living are changing and becoming less continuous, and the zones of transition between life situations and life stages are becoming more complicated (Bovenberg, 2008). Traditional services cannot always cope with these complexities. This may mean being out of school but not yet in a job or on the track back to employment but without access to somewhere to live. Often this coincides with other acute problems that may require immediate help. What some have called ânew social risksâ (Bonoli, 2005) cannot be dealt with using the manual of standard risks that typically shape the range of social services and transfer-systems of post-war welfare states. Innovative ways of offering a quick fix, often provisionally, may well be the critical missing link when it comes to providing living and working arrangements that keep people âin the gameâ. Quite a number of the social innovations studied in the WILCO project involved establishing this kind of short-term, time-limited, ad hoc support. One telling example was the âWelfare Foundation Ambrosianoâ in Milan, Italy (Evers et al., 2014, p. 182), that aimed to support individuals and families with a quick supply of credit who were temporarily in need for various reasons (redundancy, illness, and so on), regardless of their previous or current type of employment contract and country of origin. âSocial contractsâ with individuals and groups Traditionally, most public welfare services have the status of rights that are unconditional insofar as they usually simply require a set of material preconditions to be fulfilled. A new tendency in welfare arrangements, particularly in the field of workfare, has been for clients to enter a form of contractual relationship where the preconditions for support concern their future behaviour. These types of contractual relationship involve the clients taking exclusive responsibility for themselves."

118,582,0.326,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"17.2.5 Risk Analysis and Public Confidence, by Naomi Kaida, the University of Tokyo In this summer school, lecturers and students proposed various arguments. In this essay, however, I would like to focus on two points: one is an answer to the question posed by Professor Kastenberg, and the other is an extension of the discussion among the students. The construction of this essay is as follows. Firstly, a response to the question is proposed. The question is about improvement of risk analysis and avoiding loss of public confidence. Secondly, further thoughts about the discussion are suggested. The main point of the argument is the relationship between social decision-making and nuclear engineers. One of the students said that it was society that would make a decision about whether to stop using nuclear power, and he would obey the social determination as an engineer. However, this essay suggests that the social/technical dichotomy is meaningless. Finally, an integrated idea of the whole is demonstrated: to construct or reconstruct public confidence, arguments in more detail among nuclear engineers are needed. Professor Kastenberg posed some interesting questions, and one of them is, âWhat would it take to improve the quality of risk analysis and emergency planning"
169,457,0.326,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"many interpretations that no single model appears as a tested example (Fontaine 2011). Secondly, previous experiments on North American rivers, e.g., the Columbia River basin, the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin river basin and delta in California (Johnson 1999), have proven very costly in terms of time and money invested as well as the institutional complexities that had to be harmonized (Richter et al. 2006). In these cases the process entailed multiple layers (executive, manager, and technical) of decision and review (Walters et al. 2000) and was agitated by the levels of sociopolitical controversy surrounding the signiï¬cant economic trade-offs at hand (Richter et al. 2006). If success requires years of sustaining such effort, many might opt for less costly approaches. Finally, despite some exceptions (Allan and Stankey 2009), there are few, convincing success stories in AMâs history of risky and costly experiments (Lee 1999; Medema et al. 2008). One reason may be that often success is hard to detect when clear thresholds are difï¬cult to establish and measure (van Wilgen and Biggs 2011), though adaptive learning successfully developed ï¬ow thresholds on the Letaba (Pollard et al. 2009) and Kissimmee (Toth et al. 1998) rivers. Another reason is that no history of successfully repeated experiments can be built on the basis of contradictory deï¬nitions or applications of AM (Allen et al. 2011). The slow adoption of AM can broadly be explained by path dependence on conventional, control-centered management strategies. A variety of factors can contribute to this: funding and administrative priorities based on reactive rather than proactive management paradigms (Walters 1997), failure to identify or address the potential to shift goals to acknowledge the increased risk of surprise because of social sources of uncertainty (Tyre and Michaels 2011), defaulting to extant institutional norms rather than reï¬ecting, box-ticking as opposed to learning and favoring competition over cooperation (Allan and Curtis 2005), and resource limitations in terms of funding and human capital. The novel capacities that AM requires of any river manager would be a major barrier to adoption. These capacities include developing new ways for managers and stakeholders to collaborate under high uncertainty, especially in integrating science and policy in participatory processes, considering a wide range of practices over long time periods projected in future scenarios (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007). As opposed to direct administration of agency employees, managers might have to patiently attend to repeated phases of social learning by the community in implementing and then sustaining new and innovative management approaches (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007)."

Many community activists were highly critical of their fellow neighbors whom they perceived as demanding not only toward the state, but also toward the voceros and other people in the community that were actively participating in various projects. Often, these community activists experienced that they got little gratitude in return, and instead received scolding, accusations and criticism. Many of the internal conflicts of the communal councils were related to the different and contradictory understanding of what these organs were supposed to provide, who was responsible for providing it and how. I once asked Candy, a community activist in 23 de Enero, why she thought that it was so difficult to organize people. They were dealing with the problem of mobilizing enough people to stand for the elections they were organizing. She answered dryly: âI have been everywhere in these streets. There is nothing new you can tell me. I know Venezuelans. They want you to bring them a bag of food, then"

Within this context, the MI requested the World Bank to support a process to shift the paradigm from reactive to proactive drought management. Specifically, MI requested: (i) to help with an âinstitutional upgradeâ through structuring and facilitating a more permanent institutional approach and response to drought, and improving integration within and between federal and state institutions; and (ii) to help with a âtechnical upgradeâ through developing concrete drought monitoring tools and preparedness plans/protocols. The Brazil Drought Preparedness and Climate Resilience non-lending technical assistance program (Drought NLTA) was thus designed and initiated in July 2013 to address this request."

The Committee on Fisheries (2013) and the Committee on International Trade (2013) of the European Parliament formulated their opinions on the proposal. The former Committee concentrated on matters that were of relevance to the marine environment or aquaculture. A proposed amendment, among others, was with regard to the list of invasive species of importance to the EU. It was felt that such a list should be kept open and regularly revised and that it should take into account that there are invasive species native to some European regions but alien to others. In other words, the required course of action might differ between Member States (MS). Moreover, it was felt that the public should be kept informed and that a scientific advisory group should be established since scientific advice is seen as a âkey to the successful implementation and oversight of the proposed legislationâ (Lemke et al. 2010). Opinions were taken into consideration by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (2013) and included in the amendments laid down in its draft report on the proposed EC legislation mentioned above. Finally, the Council adopted a new regulation on IAS and published it in the Official Journal of the European Union on 4 November 2014.10 The new regulation entered into force on 1 January 2015 with its main objectives being to âprevent, minimise and mitigate the adverse effects of invasive alien species on biodiversity and related ecosystem services, and on human health and safety as well as to reduce their social and economic impactâ.11 The IAS problem was to be addressed in a comprehensive way through three main types of interventions, i.e. prevention, early detection and rapid eradication. It was also stated that IAS that were already widely spread needed to be managed. Nevertheless, at present there are a few mechanisms to support synchronisation of approaches between neighbouring countries or countries in the Baltic subregion, including Russia. Moreover, so far there is no common EU ballast water policy. It seems that the EU is leaning towards ratifying and implementing the BWM Convention. According to the 2013 Proposal (2013/0307COD), Member States that identified ballast waters as an important pathway would have to include in their action plans measures of the BWMC (Article 11 of the proposal). However, Member States are not obliged to ratify the Convention by the new EU regulation, as it is stated in the document: âAction should build on the experience gained in the Union and in Member States in managing certain pathways, including measures established through the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments adopted in 2004. Accordingly, the Commission should take all appropriate steps to encourage Member States to ratify that Conventionâ.12 Moreover, it was stressed by the Committee on Fisheries in its draft note that although ballast water and hull fouling are the most significant vectors of AS introduction, only five Member States have ratified the BWMC.

221,210,0.325,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"The ideology of LCS emphasises âpeopleâ â the society â as the source of, and at the same time, solution to, climate change. It highlights existing human activities as the main contributors to global GHG emissions and therefore calls for efforts of the current society in all sectors to shift their mass consumption behaviour and lifestyle to a new consumption pattern that poses less harm to the environment. Low carbon society is a new society that consumes relatively low amounts of resources (raw materials, energy and water) in minimising GHG emissions to avoid adverse effects of climate change. Despite the fact that the concept stresses on social reform for better environmental system, it does not compromise the attainment of robust economic growth and maintenance of high quality of life. In this light, there are two fundamental aspects of LCS in leading societies towards reducing GHG emissions: 1. âDecouplingâ of economic activities, urban growth and urban transportation from intense resource and energy consumption and GHG emissions towards minimising the environmental impacts of increased economic activities and transportation (see Li 2011; UNEP 2011, 2014) 2. Exploration for attainment of potential social, environmental and economic âcobenefitsâ arising out of climate change policies, which have been found to be highly pertinent to effective implementation at the local city level and to getting greater political acceptance of the policies (see de Oliveira et al. 2013; Seto et al. 2014) In realising LCS, various âsoftâ and âhardâ infrastructure developments/improvements are needed to encourage communities to change their preferences and behaviours to the practice of green lifestyles. âSoftâ infrastructure includes intangible elements that comprise of awareness, education, governance, institutions, legislation and finance. On the other hand, âhardâ infrastructure refers to physical elements that include the urban form, land use structure, transportation system, technology, building design and utilities (see Fig. 7.1). Specific strategies for low carbon society transformation for one city will be different from another city with respect to their geographic, economic, political and sociocultural contexts."

Indeed we observe that in the case where farmers anticipate climate change, as the insurance payout amount increases there is a switch in the level of diversification under the more pronounced climate change scenario. Interestingly this effect is in the direction of greater diversification towards cash crops. This result is in line with literature that claims that a lack of access to insurance leads to a lower likelihood of farmers adopting new technologies (Feder et al. 1985; Antle and Crissman 1990). It is also confirmed by results from Asfaw et al. (2015), which suggest that policy interventions as well as insurance and credit scheme need to be prioritized taking households exposure to climatic risk into account and enabling farmers to pursue choices and diversify their portfolio of choices, for crop and income, so to reduce their vulnerability to poverty. This is suggested in our case, through the mechanism in play such that, as insurance reduces downside risk, farmers have an incentive to invest in higher risk and higher returns activities. Last but not least, our simulations further suggest that extension and weather index insurance are complementary in the Malawian context, both leading to greater levels of adaptation and improved farmer welfare. Farming is a risky enterprise and one that will only become riskier under climate change. While our analyses have highlighted the important role that extension and insurance can play in better managing that risk, limited financial resources will require governments to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of each strategy in the design of national or subnational policies. Although we did not explore it here, extension, in the form of information on climate change impacts, is likely to affect the budgetary outlays for any subsidized weather index insurance by helping in its design. The general conclusion is therefore that priority should be given to providing accurate and useful weather and climate information to farmers, as well as clear explanation of its implications in terms of adaptation options. Insurance, although not an adaptation strategy per se, can help in the adaptation process if appropriately designed to minimize the moral hazard that may attend insurance schemes that incentivize additional risk taking."
78,340,0.325,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In scientific terms, humans are treated as mere scientific objects, i.e., they are elucidated with a view to predict and/or to manipulate them7. As pointed out by Arendt, the scientific discourse is indexed on necessity: âwhat science and the quest of knowledge are after is irrefutable truth, that is, propositions human beings are not free to rejectâthey are compellingâ (Arendt 1978, p. 59). In scientific terms, contingency is just another name for âepistemic failureâ, a not-yet-known. By denoting contingency with the term uncertainty, i.e., as a negative, certainty is made the norm or the ideal. And scientific knowledge is paired with certainty of facts, even after several decades of quantum mechanics, which rather teaches us that uncertainty and indeterminacy are intrinsic to scientific knowledge as well. This scientific register positions humans as an object of enquiry, a âmaterialâ, inherently heteronomous i.e., as fully determined by external materials, forces and processes. When considered in ethical terms, as Arendt put it ironically, âattemps to define human nature almost invariably end with some construction of a deityâ¦â (Arendt 1959, p. 12). Furthermore, she reckons that freedom has wrongly been identified with sovereignty in political and philosophical thought: âIf it were true that sovereignty and freedom are the same, then indeed no man could be free, because sovereignty, the ideal of uncompromising self-sufficiency and mastership, is contradictory to the very condition of plurality. No man can be sovereign because not one man, but men, inhabit the earthâand not, as the tradition since Plato holds, because of manâs limited strength, which makes him depend upon the help of othersâ (Arendt 1959, p. 210). Understanding freedom as sovereignty has a huge price, the price of reality: âsovereignty is possible only in imagination, paid for by the price of realityâ (Arendt 1959, p. 211). Ethical/philosophical narratives of what it is to be human contend with the need to escape from, or at least to balance with,"

In conclusion, an educational model of big science is emerging, combining computational and inferential thinking in an integrated fashion, cementing conceptual understanding through direct experience with data (Data Sciences @ Berkeley 2015). This approach stems from a new emphasis on âbig dataâ, which can be traced back to the Fourth Paradigm book (Hey et al. 2009) and which is becoming more and more relevant with the growth and worldwide organization of big data repositories; I offered some examples of them in the biology sector.

The authors of this book chapter believe that the Second International Symposium on Rural Design being planned to be held in Australia in the near future (the ï¬rst was held at the University of Minnesota in January 2010) can be an important follow-up to provide a strong evidence-based argument for political and policy changes impacting urban expansion at national, state, regional, and local levels in Australia and worldwide. Rural Design can integrate knowledge across disciplines, and while not directly engaged in research, rural designers can translate and apply research knowledge to the design process, helping bridge the gap between science and society, while improving the social, economic, and environmental conditions of human communities on Earth, as articulated by this diagram of the rural design process (Fig. 4.7)."

Running alongside these âin-houseâ activities were other investigations pursued for quite different purposes, by medical men who were not formally associated with the zoological societies and were often marginal to their profession. These men deliberately sought out dead and diseasedzoo animals and worked to refashion them into points of comparison with humans in the hope of advancing medicine and potentially their careers. In comparison with âin-houseâ activities, their work was less concerned with using medicine to shape animals, than using animals to shape medicine. Their efforts to develop comparative perspectives on disease drew on prevailing approaches to comparative anatomy. As outlined above, this activity was rooted in the premise that unity existed in the midst of species diversity, and sought, through comparative studies of diverse species, to identify underlying laws of bodily structure and function. As the nineteenth century progressed, it drew strength from successive, overlapping scientific and intellectual traditions, notably natural theology at the turn of the nineteenth century, Romantic naturphilosophie, cell theory (as developed by Schwann and elaborated by Virchow), Charles Darwinâs theory of evolution and, in the 1870s, Ernest Haeckelâs evolutionary morphology (which sought to determine relations between organisms by tracing them back to common ancestors).97 Meanwhile, a general physiology that evolved separately from medically oriented physiology likewise attempted to extract general laws from the diversity of animal life.98 The notion of disease as âlife gone wrongâ, which gained strength mid-century through Virchowâs work, facilitated the incorporation of pathology into this comparative, biological project, while"
180,168,0.325,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have attuned the attention of policy makers and health practitioners to the importance of protecting and promoting the publicâs health in the face of increased care needs and extreme resource scarcity. In particular, acute care needs for the critically ill and discussions of treatment priorities have been the subject of much debate in pandemic planning (Hick et al. 2007; Melnychuk and Kenny 2006; Uscher-Pines et al. 2006). This is not surprising, as it has been estimated that more than 700,000 Americans may require mechanical ventilation during a pandemic, far outnumbering available ventilators (Rubinson et al. 2010; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005). Additionally, shortages of hospital beds, personnel, and other equipment can be expected during a pandemic, which may limit the ability to meet an expected increase in patient volume (World Health Organization 2008). Prudentially planning for the publicâs increased care needs during a pandemic requires assessing surge capacity, especially in critical care units (CCU).

365,38,0.325,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Abstract Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach to guide the management of agriculture in the era of climate change. The concept was first launched in 2009, and since then has been reshaped through inputs and interactions of multiple stakeholders involved in developing and implementing the concept. CSA aims to provide globally applicable principles on managing agriculture for food security under climate change that could provide a basis for policy support and recommendations by multilateral organizations, such as UNâs FAO. The major features of the CSA approach were developed in response to limitations in the international climate policy arena in the understanding of agricultureâs role in food security and its potential for capturing synergies between adaptation and mitigation. Recent controversies which have arisen over CSA are rooted in longstanding debates in both the climate and sustainable agricultural development policy spheres. These include the role of developing countries, and specifically their agricultural sectors, in reducing global GHG emissions, as well as the choice of technologies which may best promote sustainable forms of agriculture. Since the term Ê»CSAâ was widely adopted before the development of a formal conceptual frame and tools to implement the approach, there has been considerable variation in meanings applied to the term, which also contributed to controversies. As the body of work on the concept, methods, tools and applications of the CSA approach expands, it is becoming clearer what it can offer. Ultimately, CSAâs utility will be judeged by its effectiveness in integrating climate change response into sustainable agricultural development strategies on the ground."
365,112,0.325,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"index-based agricultural insurance, but thus far, the quality of their performance has been questionable and there remains a significant need to redesign them (BinswangerMkhize 2012). With new sources of information and improved communication technologies, the continued redesign of various forms of insurance is a major challenge for interdisciplinary research and practitioners alike. Social safety nets A higher frequency of extreme events and loss of livelihood due to changing weather may cause farmers to loss their main sources of income, and in many cases food for subsistence. Society will need to design innovative approaches to sustain individuals and communities that experience significant loss as a result of climate change. These approaches must enable them to survive through tough transitional periods while also providing the foundation for re-engaging in the economy. The design of safety net mechanisms may consist of emergency intervention, relocation, insurance arrangements, credit and financial products, and job training. These mechanisms need to be able to adjust to varying conditions and to recognize the limited capacity of the poor to utilize such assistance and insurance while also having rapid response times in order to be effective (Dercon 2002). Incentives for farmer-level adoption The most important factor that affects adoption of new technologies is incentives. There is growing research to introduce innovative policies that will provide farmers the incentives to utilize new technologies, engage in preventive practices to reduce the risks of climate change, and adopt resilient new varieties and activities most appropriate for the challenges posed by climate change. Adoption of existing and new technologies is a crucial element of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. There is evidence that many barriers to adoption of new valuable technology exist, which are discussed in the literature (Zilberman et al. 2004). New information and communication technologies provide new opportunities to improve the ways that new technologies are introduced and marketed to enhance adoption. These technologies can be used to improve the information that farmers have of new technologies, accelerate the learning curve of using technologies efficiently and effectively, and reduce the fit and reliability risk associated with these technologies. Innovative approaches may be applied by cooperative extension as well as the private sector. Migration Since climate change will result in relocation of people, design of mechanisms and institutions to facilitate peaceful migration and relocation will become important. As the 2015 migration crisis1, resulting from the Syrian war and other problems, in Europe suggests, accommodating immigrants is a major policy challenge. Mechanisms to address the increase in migration due to climate change will be a priority of climate smart policy. According to Docherty and Giannini (2009), there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to address the climate change refugee problem. They call for a new legal instrument that will establish the"

248,64,0.324,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","fertilizers and agrochemicals further affects local communities and ecosystems. Water supply to urban areas is also affected (see OrÃ© et al. 2009; Woodhouse 2012; Yacoub et al. 2015). In all cases the poor suffer most from deteriorating water resources. Political consequences of virtual water export by agribusiness companies are associated with the increase of control over water resources by the private sector companies, and consequently decrease of control by local communities and local and national governments. Many studies express how, more than ever before and regionally often in explosive trends, companies obtain water rights in legal and illegal ways, supported by Free Trade Agreements (Solanes and Jouravlev 2007). This supports water grabbing, affecting many smallholders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (see, e.g., Mehta et al. 2012; Smaller and Mann 2009; Sultana and Loftus 2012; Venot and Clement 2013; Zoomers and Kaag 2013). Multinational agribusiness and retailers react to the critiques, for instance, by developing water stewardship certiï¬cation (Vos and Boelens 2014). Consumers in the North are increasingly aware of, and concerned about, their ecological footprint. Their pressure has led multinational companies to engage in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mechanisms and claim âcarbon-neutrality,â âecologicalâ production, or âfair trade.â Major agro-export companies use labels such as GlobalGAP and BRC, to certify product quality and the environmental sustainability of the production processes, as required by international supermarket chains (Fulponi 2007). Recently, water has become âcertiï¬ableâ as well. For example, the Alliance for Water Stewardship initiative by the WWF and other international organizations develops standards certifying that extracted water comes from sustainable sources (AWS 2011). For example, the widely used GlobalGAP scheme, but also the Rainforest Alliance, IFOAM, MPS-ABC flower industry certiï¬cate, and the standards of the multi-stakeholder âround tablesâ of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Better Sugarcane Initiative (BSI), Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) include water criteria (Vos and Boelens 2014). These standards can potentially protect ecosystems and water usersâ communities against âwater miningâ and contamination by agro-export companies. However, it is worrisome that the social and environmental norms are set and monitored nearly exclusively by labeling entities from the North, without space for the voices and demands of local water usersâ collectives (see Bond 2008). Indeed, as we have detailed elsewhere (Vos and Boelens 2014), current certiï¬cation practices bear the risk of exclusion, and reinforcement of existing social inequity. Important questions also remain about what certiï¬cation schemes mean for the possibilities of (heterogeneous) smallholders to participate in international trade chains, which demand uniform production conditions and product qualities. Next is the question whether such schemes allow for monitoring and compensation of off-farm impacts of farm-based water extraction and pollution practices. Standards mainly focus on the farm level and not on the watershed nor community; and standards reinforce local inequalities by favoring and legitimizing presumably âefï¬cientâ water use technology like drip irrigation (mainly used by big land"

277,8,0.324,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"In this context, the social sciences have played an important role in shaping public understanding of immigrant integration processes, and in many cases also in shaping government policies. When this started to happen and the way in which this took place, however, varies from one country to another, and from city to city. The specific role of social scientists in shaping policies also varies greatly: in some cases researchers have been quite active both in the scientific process of formulating the content of policies and in the political process of getting policies established. In other cases, social scientists have distanced themselves, or have been kept at a distance, from policymaking. Between these two positions many variations also exist. Scientists may have influenced policies, but the reverse may also be the case: policymakers may play a role in shaping the production of knowledge. Policymakers may solicit the knowledge they wish to have in many ways and with varying degrees of scientific freedom for researchers. Major differences exist between European countries in the way relations between policy and research on immigrant integration have evolved. Nowadays, however, a feature common to many European countries is that the body of scientificallybased knowledge on immigrant integration has increased substantially, while at the same time public authorities seem to have become less interested in making use of the assembled knowledge. The current relationship between migration research and policymaking seems to have led to a certain disenchantment about researchpolicy dialogues. Although the idea of âevidence-based policymakingâ has gained wide recognition discursively, strong evidence also exists that politicians and policymakers often use scientific research for symbolic rather than instrumental purposes (Boswell 2009). Clearly, in parallel with the increasing politicisation of the field, earlier optimism about the value of academic expertise in guiding rational societal steering has yielded to a growing cynicism about the validity of research and the credibility of researchers (Scholten and Verbeek 2014). At the same time, various scholars have indicated their disenchantment about the policy-driven orientation of research in this area and the lack of theoretical development in this research field (Favell 2003; Bommes and ThrÃ¤nhardt 2010). They see this as an effect of the intense contacts between researchers and policymakers that have existed in several countries. Critics have coined the term âmethodological nationalismâ to describe research fields where choice of topics, questions to be answered, conceptual and theoretical approaches, and the sources to be used largely depend on political and policy framing by national governmental actors (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002). This, in turn, has led to a call for more independent, theory-driven and (international) comparative research (Penninx et al. 2006). This book aims to develop deeper insights into how research and policymaking in the field of migrant integration have developed historically and how this interrelationship plays out in the strongly politicised climate of opinions on migration in Europe. We do this firstly by developing a conceptual frame for analysis of research-policy dialogues (in this introductory chapter).

10,152,0.324,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Given the complex physical and policy landscape for water management in England generally, and in the Somerset area more speciï¬cally, it is useful to reflect upon drought governance as it relates to management of drinking water, agricultural water, and water for nature and biodiversity. Drought is seen to both influence, and be influenced by, activities related to drinking water, agriculture and horticulture, industrial activity, infrastructure (e.g. energy provision), navigation, and environmental protection (ï¬sheries, wetlands, wildlife and plants) (Environment Agency 2015a). There are a range of planning activities to increase the resilience of the English water system to short and longer term changes as a result of climate change and increasing water demand, including actions speciï¬cally related to exceptional drought events. For example, water companies in the UK are required to consider both supply planning (such as new supply and transfer investments) and demand management (water efï¬ciency activities, and temporary use bans to restrict household and business consumption during droughts) as a way to increase the resilience of the water system to social, technological and climatic change. Achieving a resilient supply and demand balance has been deemed necessary as drought and water scarcity (van Loon and van Lanen 2013) are historical features of the water system in the UK (Rahiz and New 2012; Taylor et al. 2009) and because climate change will increase the frequency of short-term periods of dryness and multi-year droughts (Environment Agency 2015a). The other actions that ensure the UK water system is resilient to changes in climate are how water is managed during drought and water scarcity events. With regards to drought governance at the national level, there is an existing emergency management hierarchy of national, regional and local decision making around emerging periods of crisis. The drought management scheme that covers Somerset is the âSouth West Drought Planâ (Environment Agency 2012a), supported by a national level drought framework, which was updated in June of 2015 (Environment Agency 2012b, 2015a). The 2010â2012 drought also led to a recognition of the need to strengthen the networks that need to be mobilised during drought events (e.g. Lever 2012; Waterwise 2013). In 2012 a continually functioning national drought group was set up involving stakeholders from NE, NFU (National Farmers Union),"
264,258,0.324,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"(Brousseau, 1981) was an instance of a more global didactic phenomenon. This work of mathematization of the didactic ï¬eld itself was not developed further, but it strongly influenced my conception of resource development, a crucial point as far as action is considered. For instance, in the resources associated with the research on differential equations mentioned above, I tried to overcome the trap of linear descriptions and to open the dynamics of situations, envisaging, for instance, possible bifurcations. I also tried to approach more explicitly the key issue of the sharing of mathematical responsibility between teacher and students than was usual in classical engineering design at that time and whose underestimation appeared as a major source of denaturation. The spontaneous conception of reproducibility was thus proven to be an obstacle to the dissemination of didactical designs coming from research and their productive use for action. I would not say that this didactic obstacle has been overcome. Many current educational resources still implicitly convey the same notion of reproducibility by giving the impression to the reader that classroom and individual trajectories can be ï¬xed by a succession of tasks and questions, without damage. However, this misunderstanding about what can and cannot be reproduced with what consequences is only one of the many difï¬culties met in the transition from research to action."

192,259,0.324,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In a self-reflective mood, during a conversation with Paula Curry, Cantor confesses that scientific research is not as straightforward as is sometimes suggested. Most scientists suffer from what he refers to as a âdissociative personalityâ (p. 113). On the one side, they are rigorous believers in the experimental method with its set of rules, bent on advancing knowledge (in other words: S2). On the other hand, they remain fallible human beings with all the accompanying emotional foibles (in other words: $). One of the gravest occupational hazards in science, moreover, is simultaneous discovery. Sooner or later, somebody else will have the same idea. Scientists are driven by one desire: recognition by their peers (the Krausses of this world), but in order to obtain recognition, priority is essential. To score a Nobel Prize, one has to be the first to reach the summit. Thus, the push for priority is enormous. And the only way to establish priority is to be the first to publish. In other words, due to the confrontation with arginine (the object a), the self-contained expert (S2) falls victim to disruptive desire, and this results in a split (Spaltung) between adherence to methodological safeguards (S2) and the desire to maintain his advantage, his momentum, so that Cantorâs eagerness to score ($) suddenly seems to overrule his impeccable technique. Krauss is Cantorâs scientific conscience or superego. If the experiment proves impossible to replicate, Krauss may accuse him of sloppiness, or even fabrication: âSurely he is not calling you a â. Paula stopped shortâ, p. 109). And once someoneâs credibility in science is damaged, it can never be repaired. The only option left to Cantor is to do the experiment himself, to become his own Servant as it were, and to design a second experimental test, climbing Everest by a different route (p. 116). Because he cannot trust Stafford anymore (p. 113), he has to take the experiment literally in his own hands, doffing his costume for a lab coat. It is only via working through that the methodological requirements and desire for recognition can be reconciled again. Various instances of self-reflection can be discerned on the epistemic level. In his Nobel speech, looking back on his experiences, Stafford suggests that the failure of the Harvard team to replicate the results was due to a procedural discrepancy that was âreally quite trivialâ, adding that âif there is one lesson to be learned from this experience, itâs that even the smallest details should be put in oneâs notebook â¦ You never know which details may turn out to be crucialâ (p. 198). This self-reflection not only concurs with the principles of experimental methodology, but also with the psychoanalytic rule that one should report any observations; that one should take care not to exclude any of them, for in principle nothing is irrelevantâ. Even seemingly trivial details (the bagatelle) may prove to be highly significant (Freud 1917/1940, p. 297). But in the novel, the role of the analyst, listening to the dialogues (the flow of university discourse) with evenly-poised attention, and from an oblique perspective, falls to Leah, the expert in Bachtinian analysis (p. 82). She is not at all interested in proteins, membranes or arginine, but rather in the grammar of biomolecular discourse. When challenged to share her observations (by Jean Ardley, Leahâs supervisor, who happens to visit them), she points to the remarkably role of the term âweâ in experimental discourse. Why do scientists always use the pluralis majestatis (âWe, scientistsâ, âWe, the authorsâ) when speaking about science? What is wrong"

Framed differently, having sufficient disposable time for engaging in social and cultural activities is a measure of well-being. Contrary to Boserupâs claim of incremental agricultural development progressing from long fallow systems to multiple cropping, the sociometabolic theory presents a different view of âtransitionsâ between regimes: the shift between energy regimes is instead associated with a major transformation of society (such as the Neolithic and Industrial Revolutions in the past). Sociometabolic regimes are not viewed as static. Instead, they consist of a set of opportunities and constraints within which certain dynamics occur. However, if the dynamics transcend or are pushed out of the boundary conditions of the regime by exogenous forces, turbulence will ensue with an unpredictable outcome anywhere between a collapse of the social system (Leemans and Costanza 2005; Tainter 1988) and a transition into another sociometabolic regime (Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007)."

The funded projects intended to move away from a âdonorshipâ approach to more equal partnership terms, combining the latest scientific discoveries with local knowledge to maximise research impact. Projects also aimed to strengthen local capacities in the relevant S&T fields and their applications, through training activities and the exchange of staff.

182,34,0.323,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"We do not attempt a complete account of the history of animals in medicine: the subject is too vast and too neglected.54 Instead, we aim to set a new research agenda and to illustrate where it might lead through a series of case studies that are drawn from the authorsâ individual research programmes. These studies explore animal histories of medicine, and histories of animals in medicine, on scales ranging from the local to the global, from the 1830s to the present day. They are designed to be read separately as standalone examples of the contexts in which animals became important to medicine and the difference they made to it. Read collectively, they illuminate the diverse species, spaces, methods, people, problems and contexts of enquiry that were involved in constructing animal health as a medical problem. In tracing how that construction changed over time, they also trace the shifting place of animals within medicine, and how animals moulded its relationships with veterinary medicine and the life sciences. Cross-cutting questions include: What circumstances attracted human attention to animals and their diseases, and what networks developed around them? How can we account for the attention paid to animals by members of the medical profession, which is generally assumed to be exclusively concerned with the health of humans? How and where were investigations and interventions performed on animals, and what roles did animals play within them? While our human protagonistsâ affective relationships with animals are generally impossible to discern, the concept of the animal role permits analysis of the multiple values that humans assigned to animals. We also ask: What difference did animals make to medicineâto its ideas, practices, the health of its human and animal subjects, and its interpersonal and interdisciplinary relationships? What difference did medicine make to animalsâto their bodies and experiences in life, the manner and timing of their deaths, and to their afterlives? In selecting which aspects of the history of animals in medicine to study, we made a deliberate decision not to focus on the laboratorybased subjects of experimental medicine. This is partly because these animals, notably rodents and dogs, already feature in the handful of existing animal-centred accounts of medical history. It is also because"

It reflects the strong commitment to integration and a transdisciplinary approach, embracing disciplines as diverse as physical oceanography, sediment dynamics, agriculture, demographics and poverty. Input of policy experts and a substantial array of stakeholders are also fundamental. This study provided opportunities for substantial learning across standard discipline boundaries, providing co-produced policy relevant outputs and insights. It also fostered a family of researchers who developed a shared understanding that could be applied to this difficult and challenging problem. This included effective sharing of knowledge and learning to question and contribute effectively outside an individualâs specialist field. Integration is core to what has been accomplished here bringing together natural and social sciences in ways that are distinct and groundbreaking. Such integration needs to start as the research is initiated and is an ongoing process. Integration needs to be core to the project with key questions and themes that are properly resourced. To be policy relevant, the research must be guided by the perspectives, needs and expertise encapsulated by local stakeholders, especially the decision-making processes and governance context of the deltas in question. Stakeholders from civil society, the non-government sector and of course agencies of government are all involved in policy formulation. Indeed, one of the outstanding successes of the ESPA Deltas collaboration, which is reflected in this book, has been the engagement with and the impact on the policy context of Bangladesh. The research has raised, for the first time, consideration of ecosystem services, their links to poverty and livelihoods and their influence in the national policy and planning process across a range of government agencies including the Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission and other government partners such as the Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO). Indeed the Government of Bangladesh has requested continued engagement and further development of some of the modelling tools in the context of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, which is a new national planning approach. Engaging with policy was always a main aspiration of the research and is perhaps the aspect of which we are most proud. The research provides both the foundation and analyses which has led to some of its most innovative approaches and significant insights.

252,58,0.323,The Ethics of Vaccination,"responsibility can be characterized as metaphysical arguments: they concern the issue as to what makes an obligation âcollectiveâ and the nature of the relationship between such collective obligations and the individual obligations of the collectiveâs constituent members. Without the presumption of exhaustiveness, I will present in this section some of the metaphysical conceptions of collective obligation and of its relation with individual obligations. I will apply these considerations to the case of the collective obligation to realize herd immunity and its relation to the individual obligation to be vaccinated. Let us start with the case of the trapped man, discussed by Virginia Held (1970). In her example, three pedestrians notice a man trapped under a collapsed building. They can save the man by removing the beams that keep him trapped. However, they fail to organize as a collective and to decide which beam to remove first; as a consequence, the trapped man dies. According to Held, the three men are collectively morally responsible for failing to form an organized group that could have saved the trapped man. This example is taken by Held to show that collective responsibility of random collections is simply distributive: each individual is individually responsible for the groupâs failure. As put by Held, âif random collection R is morally responsible for the failure to do A, then every member of R is morally responsible for the failure to do A, although, perhaps, in significantly different proportionsâ (Held 1970, p. 480). Held applied this principle of distributive collective responsibility to the case of backward-looking responsibility. However, the same principle can be applied to future-looking moral responsibility, that is, moral obligations. Consider, for instance, the analogous âcoordinated bystanderâ case discussed by Tracy Isaacs (2011, 2014), which we have presented above. According to Isaacs, the putative collective obligation has âexactly the same ordering and mediating potential for individual action that an actual collective obligation wouldâ (Isaacs 2011, p. 150). In cases like this, it is clear (to the reasonable person) what the group should do in order to save the children, so the group agent has the putative collective obligation to save the children. In virtue of this putative collective obligation, Isaacs argues, each individual has a moral obligation to do her part (Isaacs 2011, p. 151) to contribute to the fulfilment of the putative collective obligation. As Isaacs put it, âthis putative collective obligation (â¦) is a starting point for bridging the apparent gap between seemingly inconsequential individual contributions and new understandings of the part they play in more powerful collective undertakingsâ (Isaacs 2011, pp. 151â152)."
87,9,0.323,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","Feeding a growing population is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century. However, 200 years ago, it was this very same challenge that initiated the foundation of the University of Hohenheim in 1818. Three years earlier, in 1815, the volcano Tambora erupted in Indonesia. This local geological event had tremendous impact on the global climate. The eruption ejected huge quantities of ash into the atmosphere, causing two âsummers without sunâ. In Europe, lower temperatures led to poor crop growth, resulting in famine and riots. On 20 November 1818, King Wilhelm I of WÃ¼rttemberg founded an agricultural education and research station at Hohenheim, with the aim of contributing to regional food security by educating farmers and developing better agricultural production methods. Since then, the University of Hohenheim has grown continuously and today consists of three faculties, namely, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences. Research and education is still focused on societal and environmental challenges, such as food security and climate change. Building on this basis, the âbioeconomyâ has recently emerged as a leading theme for the University of Hohenheim. The bioeconomy, often referred to as âbiobased economyâ, encompasses the production of biobased resources and their conversion into food, feed, bioenergy and biobased materials. A biobased value chain includes the primary production of biobased resources, their conversion to higher-value goods via processing and commercialisation on the market.

380,26,0.323,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"Venezuelan oil state that Coronil analyzed. At the same time, it extends this line of thought through inquiring into how the imagery and sociopolitical architecture of the Venezuelan oil state shaped the Bolivarian processes in the ChÃ¡vez era. Thus, this book is inspired by Coronilâs deep insights into Venezuelan society, while at the same time I locate my analysis in a different ethnographic space, context and temporality. There is a growing body of literature on the cultural, epistemic and material dimensions of oil, seemingly inspired not only by an acute awareness of how our lives are both materially and viscerally saturated and shaped by oil in the age of capitalist modernity, but also of the looming threat, or even mass-destruction, that oilâs omnipresence appears to harbor. The current renewed interest in oil is considered a âthirdâ wave of oil- and energy scholarship within anthropology (Rogers 2015:366). Challenging the political-science-dominated concept of âthe resource curseâ (Sachs and Warner 1995, 2001; Collier and Hoeffler 1998, 2000, 2005; Rosser 2006), anthropological approaches favor to explore and theorize how oil itself as well as the industries that extract it and put it into circulation âenter social, cultural, political, and economic relationshipsâ (Rogers 2015:370â371). This book aligns itself with this line of thinking, through adapting a perspective that sees oil wealth as a formative agent of multiple and interlinked aspects of Venezuelan society (Coronil 1997; Tinker Salas 2009). However, my analytical scope is conditioned by the ethnographic field that I am concerned with. Thus, I am not striving for an analysis of the oil economy per se. Rather, I am focusing on how Venezuelan social, cultural and political formationsâsuch as its political system, state apparatus, class relations, urbanization processes and national identitiesâwere shaped by the countryâs history as a petro-state, and how these formations were challenged, transformed and fought over during the ChÃ¡vez era. Moreover, I do not seek to establish a stringent analysis of how exactly oil wealth entered and circulated in the political and social system during the ChÃ¡vez era, but to better understand the multi-faceted ways in which oil wealth gained salience as a material resource, a social property and a cultural imagery. My analytical purpose for coining the concept âlens of oilâ is therefore to tease out oil wealthâs multiple properties as it enters social relations, while also underlining how its social dimensions are intertwined with its structural embeddedness in local and global political economies. Logan and McNeish (2012) argue that we need to do a âqualitative"

Climate change adaptation cannot be planned and implemented separately for biodiversity protection. Climate change adaptation will involve changes in land and natural asset use. All sectors and policies have to plan adaptation strategies and often these sectors will need additional areas to mitigate the impacts of climate change, for adaptation measures and for nature disaster protection. As long as the adaptation of different sectors is not coordinated, conflicts will arise and the objectives of biodiversity and nature conservation will be harder to achieve, causing ecological and ultimately economic damage. Therefore, climate change adaptation needs to be understood as a coherent cross-sector task with common aims but specific measures."

192,234,0.323,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Arrowsmith addresses a basic divide running through biomedicine, a clash between two (incommensurable) deontologies, two integrity regimes as it were: the principles of medical ethics on the one hand and the demands of experimental research on the other. Although biomedicine is allegedly motivated by the objective to promote well-being (enhancing the effectiveness of clinical practice), Arrowsmith emphasises that there is another, rather disruptive impulse at work as well: a violent will to control life, endangering rather than protecting the well-being, not only of research animals, but also of patients and, eventually, of biomedical researchers (such as Martin Arrowsmith) themselves. They must choose between two options, both of which are presented as morally unsatisfactory: on the one hand medical practice, portrayed as fundamentally insincere (permeated by mauvaise foi, to use the Sartrean term), on the other hand the methodology of randomised trials, depicted as inconsiderate and ruthless. After a series of fiascos, Martinâs âsolutionâ is simplification and escape (flight instead of fight). This raises the question whether this nihilistic portrayal of the moral dichotomy is inevitable. Dialectically, the relationship between medical practice and basic research may perhaps be seen in a different light. In Arrowsmith, the claim is made that, as soon as the principles of biomedical science (M1) are applied to practical situations, multiple conflicts and contradictions emerge (M2), but a more sustainable and satisfactory outcome would be the awareness that, eventually, the one cannot really function without the other (âM3). In splendid isolation, pure science becomes thin and empty, so that the plea for âpureâ research may actually be an immunisation strategy, a mechanism of defence (the beautiful soul position). Moreover, it is precisely in the confrontation with real-life situations that the relentless drive towards control, fuelling the quest for knowledge, is brought to the fore. In other words, application and extrapolation are necessary experiences to discover what science really is about. The experience of working through the conflict is then seen as a precondition for self-understanding. But this outcome is not easily achieved. The chronic tension is there for real, as indicated when we read the novel in terms of the discourse of the analyst:"
252,33,0.323,The Ethics of Vaccination,"analysis) for any person to contribute to herd immunity through vaccination when they know herd immunity already exists, since they would be (sufficiently) protected from infectious disease anyway. This mismatch between individual interest and collective interest is precisely where the ethical relevance of herd immunity lies: if the preservation or the realization of herd immunity posed any requirement on people at all, it would require (at least some) people to make their contribution to the public good regardless of whether vaccination would be (significantly) beneficial to them or of whether the risk/benefit assessment of vaccination is favourable. Therefore, being vaccinated is often primarily an ethical choice: its social importance requires individuals to make a choice for the sake of the public good, rather than exclusively for the sake of their own individual benefit. Besides, because individuals do not have strong enough incentives to contribute to public goods, and because we cannot expect that a large enough number of individuals behave ethically and make their selfless contribution to public goodsâfreeriding is often simply too temptingâtypically the protection or realization of public goods requires institutions to enforce specific policies that, if necessary, coerce individuals into making their contribution. In Chaps. 3 and 4 I will discuss the ethical justifiability of different possible vaccination policies. Of course, as said above, one might observe here that individuals do stand to benefit from vaccination, because vaccination confers them protection (though not 100% protection) against infectious diseases, and therefore the benefit is primarily individual, and therefore vaccination is rational from the point of view of individual interest; only secondarily, and as a side effect, vaccination contributes to benefitting others. However, there are two considerations to be made here: first, many individuals do not think that they (or their children) would benefit from vaccination, so to them, vaccinating would still be seen as something that goes against their personal interest, and second, as I have mentioned earlier and as we will see better in Chap. 2, vaccination ceases to be individually overall beneficial when vaccination coverage rates are sufficiently high and the small risks of vaccination outweigh the risk of catching the disease and the risks associated with the disease (which oftentimes include the risk of death). But as mentioned above, the concept of herd immunity is also ethically relevant because realisation or preservation of herd immunity is a matter of collective, rather than individual responsibility: on a large population, no single individual can, by herself, make a significant difference to whether herd immunity exists. How can individuals have an ethical obligation to"

Ethiopian government and international development bank ofï¬cials have consistently described the purpose of the Gibe III dam and its associated developments as âessentialâ to Ethiopiaâs ânational interestâ and its âgrowth and transformationâ program and Ethiopiaâs electriï¬cation needs, including electriï¬cation for the ârural poor.â Yet the on-the-ground effects of this development in the lower Omo basin and Lake Turkana regionâalready in evidence during the early phases of this developmentâsuggest the makings of a humanitarian crisis with massive scale hunger and vulnerability to disease, cross-border inter-ethnic armed conflict, major government expropriation and political repression of citizens, and irreversible environmental destructionâoutcomes that can hardly be regarded as âprogress.â Despite these predictable effects already emerging in the transboundary region, however, both government and bank statements continue to label the development a sure âsuccess,â based on GNP and per capita income, energy and other projections for the nation as a whole.32 Sorting out the differences between such macro level projections and ground level realities for the half million citizens struggling to survive in three-nation transboundary area is key to a rational discourse concerning the economic and political future of the region. At the most general level, the policy choice is an unambiguous one. Either continue along the present road to social and natural resource devastationâa road rife with human rights violationsâor bring a halt to the destruction underway in order to initiate a new pathway for actionâone consistent with internationally recognized human rights and geared to creating a sustainable future for the peoples of the transboundary region as well the three nations involved. Continuing along the present road is an unacceptable option by any measure of project outcomes that includes the transboundary region's indigenous peoples. Even if the alternative pathway deï¬ned above were to be pursued, major questions emerge as to how to proceed. For example, how is it possible to take account of the increasingly desperate survival needs of the pastoral, agropastoral and ï¬shing peoples in the transboundary region that is most impacted by the development, while simultaneously addressing the aspirations of citizens in the region as a whole? Although insufï¬cient as full answers to this question, two matters require immediate attention if a solution to this challenge is to be constructed. First of all, there is legal imperative for action. Based on violations of human rights in the transboundary regionârights recognized by the ICESCR that must be restored. This requires restoring indigenous communities' access to food and the necessary means to produce it as part of their right to an adequate standard of living. Compliance with the ICESCR is not a choiceâit is a legally binding treaty. This action could be accomplished with at least a temporary suspension of the plans for Gibe III hydrodam electricity generation, an end to the withholding of downstream river flow and the reinstatement of Dasanech and Nyangatom communities to their lands and resources along the Omo River. Reinstatement of the Omo Riverâs flow would allow inflow to Lake Turkana, bringing at least temporary reprieve to hundreds of thousands of pastoralists and ï¬shers depending on the lakeâs resources. Such a suspension should trigger at least a pause in temporary suspension of large-scale irrigated plantation construction as well, while an acceptable future scenario is being constructed."

Randrup, and Cecil Konijnendijk van den Bosch Abstract âNature-based -solutionsâ (NbS) aim to use nature in tackling challenges such as climate change, food security, water resources, or disaster risk management. The concept has been adopted by the European Commission in its research programme Horizon 2020 to promote its uptake in urban areas and establish Europe as a world leader of NbS. However, the concept has been defined vaguely. Moreover, its relationships with already existing concepts and approaches to enhance nature and its benefits in urban areas require clarification. Notably, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), urban green infrastructure (UGI) and ecosystem services (ESS) have gained prominence in academic debates and are increasingly referred to in policy-making. In this chapter main features of each of the concepts, as well as overlaps and differences between them are analysed based on a review of key literature. NbS is the most recent and broadest of the four concepts. Therefore, it may be considered as an umbrella to the other concepts but with a distinct focus on deployment of actions on the ground. EbA is a subset of NbS that is specifically concerned with climate change adaptation via the use of nature. As a planning approach, UGI, on the other hand, can provide strategic guidance for the integration of NbS into S.

38,546,0.323,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Target. This built on earlier work under the CBD to deï¬ne âheadline indicatorsâ for the 2010 Target and of the wider academic community to explore the state of the science of biodiversity indicators and to identify promising avenues (Balmford et al. 2005 and related papers in the same journal special issue arising from a Royal Society discussion meeting on âmonitoring wild nature for the 2010 targetâ). The BIP partners provided a range of metrics focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem service trends, pressures and threats, and responses. Some 31 time series metrics were gathered. Not all of the CBD headline indicators were populated (Walpole et al. 2009), but this still represented a large increase in available data for the Third Global Biodiversity Outlook in 2010 compared to its predecessor in 2007 prior to the formation of the BIP. Post-2010, the BIP has reoriented to the Aichi Targets and a focus on 2020. The partnership is strengthening to include a deeper and a wider breath of data providers. As a result, the BIP was able to deliver a ï¬rst indicator-based analysis of progress towards the Aichi Targets using a larger number of time series metrics than in 2010 (Tittensor et al. 2014). The partnership also serves to raise awareness of the Targets amongst the observing community, creates links to other processes and agreements requiring indicators, and provides opportunities to share global methods and metrics with national governments and indicator practitioners to help develop capacity and to harmonise across scales. The BIP is a complementary mechanism to GEO BON. Whilst GEO BON focuses on improving biodiversity observations that can be used in policy tools such as indicators, the BIP focuses on compiling and delivering those indicators for policy users. The two are mutually supporting and closely linked, with several organisations participating in both networks. Individuals from each network are also represented in the governance structures of the other."

341,358,0.322,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Governance Governance is generally understood to imply a societal process (Lautze et al. 2011). For the World Bank (1991), it is more specifically âthe exercise of political authority and the use of institutional resources to manage societyâs problems and affairsâ. A useful corollary views governance as âthe sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairsâ (Commission on Global Governance 1995). The GEF-supported Groundwater Governance Project, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) jointly with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank and the International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH), adopted the following definition of groundwater governance: âgroundwater governance comprises the promotion of responsible collective action to ensure control, protection and socially-sustainable utilisation of groundwater resources and aquifer systems for the benefit of humankind and dependent ecosystems. This action is facilitated by an enabling framework and guiding principlesâ (Groundwater Governance Project 2016b). Policy While the concept of âpolicyâ has become pervasive, working definitions remain elusive. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2011) defines policy as âa definite course or method of actionâ¦to guide and determine present and future conditionsâ. For the UNâs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2011), policy is âa set of decisions which are oriented towards a long term purpose or to a particular problemâ. This simple and succinct definition captures the centrality of the vital term, âdecisionâ. If we understand the policies to be made by all sectors of society with a stake in governance â not just government â then policy-making can be considered synonymous with decision-making. Once policies have been formulated, putting them in place requires instruments, tools, rules, protocols and other procedures. These may include laws, sets of rights, registrations, permits and regulations (especially regulations that allow those regulated to choose among alternative ways of complying); economic incentives and disincentives such as subsidies, taxes, tradable pollution permits and pricing structures; and civil-society actions such as those that motivate voluntary actions or behavioural changes (Theesfeld 2008). Management The term âmanagementâ is perhaps easier to grasp intuitively than âgovernanceâ. Management can be thought of as the ânitty-gritty of day-to-day operationsâ that emphasises the results of decisions (Linton and Brooks 2011). Other similar notions are âapproaches, models, principles, and information used to make decisionsâ (Bakker 2007, cited in Nowlan and Bakker 2010); âregimes based on institutions, laws, cultural factors, knowledge, and practicesâ (Solanes and Jouravlev 2006); or purposeful activities that enable the accomplishment of goals and objectives (Pahl-Wostl 2007). These definitions share a concern for routine, practical and effective ways to achieve predetermined objectives and proceed with a common caveat: recognition of conflicting interests (Wolf 2007)."
99,491,0.322,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In order to provide some counterweight against the inevitable parade of successful innovations that comes out of such a project as WILCO, we adopted a more critical perspective on social innovation research. As this chapter has shown, many perspectives on social innovations have explicit or hidden normative assumptions that obscure the dark side of the phenomenon: the failures, the conflicts and the oppression of universalistic approaches. As argued in the previous sections, attention for detail and a diverse group can go some way in preventing such assumptions from stifling the debate. In the end, one should always have a few critical questions at hand. Who benefits from the introduction of social innovations? Who loses? Did anything get worse? Common sense also helps. In the context of welfare, many of the problems are what policy science calls wicked problems, such as poverty, addictions and homelessness. These do not have easy or ultimate solutions. Eldorado is not around the corner."
365,1065,0.322,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"8. Probably the most divergence of views amongst panel members was related to the potential role of input subsidies in Climate Smart Agriculture. On the negative side, they are associated with corruption and inefficiency. On the positive side they have been effective in raising productivity as well as other benefits. Actions to reduce corruption, such as direct deposit payments and improve targeting and eligibility rules can make them more climate smart. 9. There is very strong agreement amongst panel members that greater coherence and integration is needed between agriculture and climate change policies that can lead to reduction in duplication, bureaucracy and costs. 10. Strengthening multi-disciplinary and long term systems research was considered a high priority for several panel members, as was better bridging of the policy-research divide. Developing the political will to actually enforce agreements and fostering institutional innovations to see their effective implementation in the field also emerged as priority actions."
118,360,0.322,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"we might be able to properly understand what âstructural disasterâ implies (see Table 10.1). There are two reasons for paying attention to the technological trajectory to understand the Fukushima Daiichi accident as âstructural disaster.â First, every reactor there had a long history of successful operation extending over 30 years since its start in the 1970s, which forces our attention to turn to the possibility of a more âstructuralâ cause of the accident beyond picking up individual ad hoc troubles and errors. Second, as the ratios of domestic production indicate, the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power station embody the turning point leading from licensed production to self-reliant production. For these reasons, there could exist common characteristics throughout the reactors in question at the Fukushima Daiichi power station and it is possible that such characteristics are somehow related to the âstructural disasterâ of the science-technology-society interface as manifested in the accident. In a word, the causes of âstructural disasterâ can be divided into two different categories, organizational errors and technological trajectory, as the first step to explaining the Fukushima Daiichi accident.4 If we can substantiate these two elements in understanding other independent cases as âstructural disaster,â then we will be able to have a stronger position to learn lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi accident as a âstructural disasterâ and to extend their implications for potential future extreme events. What follows is an independent substantiation of these two elements by examining the hidden accident happened long before the Fukushima Daiichi accident with a focus on a complex relationship between success and failure in the science-technology-society interface and secrecy in the interface. The hidden accident long before the Fukushima Daiichi one is a very perplexing accident of the naval turbine developed by the Imperial Japanese Navy, which occurred immediately before the outbreak of WWII. This accident enables us to redefine the complex relationship between success and failure in the science-technology-society interface both in peacetime and wartime. The accident was treated as top secret because of its timing. The suppression of information about the accident means that it has not been seriously considered as an event in the sociology of science and technology up to now. However, the description and 4 On organizational errors in the context of technological failures, see [14â17] regarding the"

Therefore, the concept is distinguished from more traditional and top-down conservation, e.g., via protected areas towards finding solutions that aim to meet the needs of a diverse range of stakeholders. For this purpose, participatory approaches to co-design, co-creation and co-management (âco-co-coâ) of nature-based solutions are advocated (EC 2016). Fourth, the concept of NbS is action-oriented. While IUCN recognises the need for linking policy with action on the ground, the latter is emphasised (MacKinnon et al. 2008, IUCN n.d.). However, the Horizon 2020 work programme for 2016â 2017 seeks for systemic solutions to the development and implementation of NbS (EC 2016). This will require that attention is placed on regulatory frameworks, planning systems and economic instruments. Concurrently, Horizon 2020 expects largescale pilot and demonstration projects that may serve as reference points for the upscaling of NbS across Europe and beyond."

They found it difficult to maintain causal bacteria in vitro, but sheep would only accept the infection when pregnant, and their physiologically restricted breeding seasons confined investigations to particular times of year.100 Zoologists likewise relied on visits to the field to acquire new parasites for their investigations, while Stockman was forced to gather ticks from the bodies of dying farmed sheep because the ticks he nurtured in his laboratory would not reveal through experiment whether they contained the infective agent of louping ill.101 These investigations proved to scientists that it was not so easy to ignore the local circumstances, sheep and infective agents of the field in favour of those nurtured and manipulated within the laboratory. Unexpectedly, inhabitants of the laboratoryâs generic spaces sometimes proved more unpredictable than those found on locally specific farms. This may explain why Stockman embarked on efforts to recreate the natural conditions of the field in his laboratory. In one experiment he tried to mimic farm-based encounters between sheep and scab mites by tying wool and scurf from infected sheep into the fleeces of healthy ones.102 He also fashioned pill boxes into cages for female mites and tied them to the skin of sheep to allow them to feed.103 To test the tickâs ability to acquire and transmit infection, he farmed them within his laboratory and actively encouraged them, at different stages in their life cycles, to fix onto and feed off sheep as they would in the field. He enclosed sheep ears and scrotums in cotton bags in order to capture the ticks for examination when they dropped off after eating their fill.104 following"
378,59,0.322,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"When considering the redesign of energy systems, urbanization trends and land use patterns, a study of the wider setting of correlations and side effects will enable people to not only think about more efï¬cient cars but also to explore how mobility can be delivered in the most sustainable way (WBGU 2011a: 342â343). Here of course we ï¬nd a strong link with the emphasis on mind-sets in this book, and my call to integrate political economy stems from what I ï¬nd to be a slightly naÃ¯ve conception of the origin and roles that ideas and paradigms play in political processes and their relation with power. While hardly anyone would explicitly argue against values like the protection of future generations or our environment, the devil lies instead in the detailâin this case the worldviews held. The same value set might lead to very different proposed solutions, given differing worldviews and their focuses. Mainstream economic mind-sets tend not to support the regulation of markets precisely because this would hamper individual freedom, happiness, creativity and meritocracyâvalues to which most people would subscribe. In one paragraph, the report mentions that Karl Polanyiâs interpretation of the industrial revolution, The Great Transformation (1944), describes how âattitudes and considerations inspired by personal beneï¬t maximisation have established themselvesâ and that with mass production, âthe âgood lifeâ has increasingly become synonymous with material wealthâ (WBGU 2011a: 67). The proposals for change in the report, however, leave this deep cultural wiring and its mental path dependencies unchallenged. Hence, it does not say how the observed value shifts can be implemented if there is no discussion of the paradigm behind the evidence and narratives used to argue which policies are suitable to embed the shift."

182,98,0.322,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"This chapter has provided an overview of the health and medicine of the animals that inhabited Britainâs zoos during the mid- to late nineteenth century. Contrary to existing historical accounts, which claim that animal health was neglected in this period and that few medical interventions took place, it reveals wide-ranging, ongoing attempts by medical men to understand, prevent and treat animal disease. By turning the spotlight onto these interventions, the circumstances that gave rise to them, and their implications for participating humans and animals, it offers new perspectives on the interlinked histories of zoos, animals and medicine. We have seen how zoos impacted on, and were moulded by, the health experiences of their animal inhabitants. Methods of animal housing, feeding and management precipitated ailments such as rickets, tuberculosis and digestive upsets, which caused much animal suffering and frequently death. To the zoological societies, these events threatened the zoosâ finances and its scientific activities, while to certain external medical men, they offered prospects of scientific and career advancement. The unanticipated occurrence of these diseases prompted the medicalization of zoosâtheir transformation into sites for medical"

269,62,0.322,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"research that gets to the heart of the historical, theoretical, and conceptual frameworks of the science are, we suggest, rarer. FC recalls that both authors expended significant energy, over the course of many drafts, adjusting the wording so that it carried enough punch for the cultural theorist and historian, and enough nuance for the neuroscientist: in particular, the many (many) annotated drafts of the article reveal, for her at least, ongoing, shared anxieties about the politics of word choice; about how, or whether, normative claims might be made; and about if and how to include sentences that pointed to the future of the field. And yet despite these risks and efforts, co-authoring brought, for FC, significant pleasures. For a cultural theorist engaged with the history of science, the opportunity to co-author and publish in a scientific journal shifted her position of annunciation from the usual disciplinary one of external commentary to one of audible authority within a field. She surmised that for a neuroscientist, the opportunity to participate in meta-conjecture, and to intervene in the overarching frameworks and potential ontologies at work in oneâs own field, might offer a somewhat unusual, and yet potentially productive, intellectual position vis-Ã -vis one of the scientific objects that is the focus of much of his research. What collaborators cannot control, of course, is how they get read, or how they will be subsequently positioned against one another. At one stage in this process, FC followed up a shared invitation, to an interdisciplinary event, to ask whether it would be of interest to hear a linked presentation (from both FC and her neuroscientific collaborator) that included some reflection on how this cross-disciplinary partnership had developed. She received a warm reply â but one that warned her of the preponderance of âcutting-edge neuroscienceâ at the event, and thus likely scepticism about a talk that would go âtoo deeply into the genealogy of a fieldâ. Some historical context was welcome, she was told â but perhaps not too much. The key was not to work too hard at âreaching across the divideâ (between the sciences and the humanities), but simply to present cutting-edge (neuroscientific) work. Her respondent lamented, additionally, that humanists were sometimes âquite lazyâ and not up to speed with the science (this writer, we note, came from the humanities). There are many important points embedded here â not a few of which we are inclined to agree with. But what is especially fascinating is the way in which a concern about an ostentatious reaching across the divide ended up not only reinscribing an unequal dyad of science (cuttingedge, worthy of admiration, and excitement) and the humanities (that"

255,136,0.322,Railway Ecology,"concerns, railways. The ï¬rst mechanism arises directly from trading activities, where the traded commodity may itself be the non-native species. In these cases, the âimportationâ of the species is deliberate, because some of its attributes are desired in the area of destination. The reasons behind the importation of species are varied, and include farming, forestry, livestock, ornamental plants and pets, laboratory testing or biocontrol. In some situations, the goal is purposely the formation of wild populations, as is the case of gaming and ï¬shing or biocontrol agents. In other cases, the imported species are to be stored in enclosed environments, but they often escape from captivity. For instance, the American mink (Neovison vison) has invaded many European countries due to accidental escape or deliberate release from fur farms (Vidal-Figueroa and Delibes 1987; Bonesi and Palazon 2007). It is worrisome that a great number of problematic invaders is still actively marketed today, including freshwater macroinvertebrates and ï¬sh (Capinha et al. 2013; Consuegra et al. 2011) and plants (Humair et al. 2015). Trading activities may also lead to the arrival of non-native species as an accidental âby-productâ of a commodity, such as a commensal, a parasite or a disease. These species can remain undetected for long periods of time and may beneï¬t from measures towards the establishment to their hosts in the wild. An illustrative example of such by-products of a traded commodity is the crayï¬sh plague (Aphanomyces astaci) in Europe. This fungus-like disease is hosted by several North American crayï¬sh species that were introduced in European wetlands in order to boost the wild stocks of this food item. However, unlike for North American species that co-evolved with the disease, the crayï¬sh plague is deadly to European species and has already caused numerous extinctions of local populations (Capinha et al. 2013). Stowaway species can be associated with trading activities or any other activity that involves a transportation vehicle. In other words, a non-native stowaway species is not speciï¬c to a particular commodity, and it can be any organism that at some point is displaced by a vehicle or its load. This occurs more often with species that are difï¬cult to detect, such as those that are small or stealthy. Known examples of these stowaway species include land snails attached to trains or their cargo (PeltanovÃ¡ et al. 2011), plankton in shipâs ballast waters (Hulme et al. 2008), or seeds in soil attached to automobiles (Hodkinson and Thompson 1997). Centers of human and commodity transportation and nearby areas (e.g. seaports and railroad stations and yards) often provide the ï¬rst records of non-native stowaways (e.g. Noma et al. 2010) and can host diverse communities of invasive species (Drake and Lodge 2004). Finally, transport infrastructures may also act as âcorridorsâ for the natural dispersal of non-native biodiversity. These infrastructures facilitate the dispersal of non-native organisms by allowing their movement across physical and environmental barriers (e.g. a mountain range now crossed by a tunnel), or by supplying suitable habitat for expanding invasive populations. Concerning the latter case, a few characteristics of the areas managed by transportation companies (e.g. road and railway verges) are considered beneï¬cial to the establishment of non-native species, particularly the regular occurrence of disturbance that gives rise to âvacantâ niches"

The fluctuation of geochemical composition in hydrothermal mixing zones may have a significant impact on the rate of microbial growth and metabolic activity, biogeochemical reactions, and the dominant microbial population. In particular, reduced compounds such as H2, CH4, HS , and Fe2+ are not only essential energy sources for chemolithotrophs but also factors that control the composition and density of the microbial community. Previous studies have investigated habitat components, for example, the boundary zone (interface) between hydrothermal fluid and ambient seawater, including low-temperature diffusive flow (Holden et al. 1998; Huber et al. 2002, 2003; Perner et al. 2007), chimney structures (Schrenk et al. 2003; Takai et al. 2001), and hydrothermal sediments (Nunoura et al. 2010; Teske et al. 2002; Yanagawa et al. 2013). These studies demonstrated the prevalence of Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and various candidate divisions in the hydrothermal system. Due to fluctuations in the environmental conditions, microbial communities in hydrothermally influenced regions exhibit variability on various spatial and temporal scales, including large-scale intra- and inter-field variability (Flores et al. 2012; Huber et al. 2010; Nunoura and Takai 2009), short-term temporal and spatial variability (Perner et al. 2009, 2013), and spatial variability on a small scale of a few centimeters to meters (Nakagawa et al. 2005; Takai et al. 2004). However, most studies focused on the variability of specific microbial populations in the zone adjacent to hydrothermal vents. To better understand microbial"

For IUCN, partnerships are a key driving force for successful conservation action. The socio-economic and environmental challenges confronting society today are complex and far from clear-cut. Bringing together diverse stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities and indigenous peoples groups, can help to address these challenges in a comprehensive and inclusive way. The complexity of urban environments underlines the importance of multidisciplinary and multi-scale partnerships in cities. Cities represent a new class of ecosystems shaped by the dynamic interactions between ecological and social systems (CBD 2012). Urban citizens depend on ecosystems both within and beyond cities for a wide variety of goods and services (e.g. food, water, energy, climate regulation), and while cities are increasingly recognised for their role in conservation (CBD 2012), urbanisation also presents a major environmental challenge, for example by driving habitat conversion (McDonald et al. 2013). Nature offers great untapped potential for improving the quality of life of urban citizens and finding solutions to challenges such as rising temperatures (the urban heat island effect) or flooding (CBD 2012). The challenge lies in developing and adopting urban planning and management approaches that ensure the delivery of regulating, provisioning, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services, while also promoting the sustainable use of resources. Ideally, stakeholders from different policy areas and sectors should come together to develop holistic approaches to managing natural capital â the worldâs stocks of natural assets which includes geology, soil, air, water and all living things. In reality however, collaboration between sectors and stakeholders is often hindered by a lack of exchange and cooperation, presenting a barrier to effective policymaking (Science for Environment Policy 2016) and the implementation of successful conservation initiatives. Multidisciplinary and cross-cutting concepts such as NBS have the potential to facilitate cooperation between sectors and contribute to a more holistic approach to tackling socio-economic and environmental challenges. From IUCNs perspective, NBS are interventions which use nature, and the ecosystem services they provide, to address societal challenges such as climate change. Well-functioning ecosystems that deliver services needed by society are at the core of these types of solutions, which include, for instance, the creation or restoration of large ecosystems; investing in natural infrastructure and watershed management for water, food and energy security and climate change adaptation; ecosystem-based mitigation oriented solutions, such as the conservation and sustainable management of forests; and using ecologically engineered solutions, such as intertidal habitats or oyster reefs to protect shorelines and reduce sea-level rise impact and coastal inundation. The aim of this chapter is to profile a broad range of partnerships led by the private sector, local communities and local/regional governments, which have restored, conserved and managed ecosystems to the benefit of people and the environment. The following sections include reflections on key outcomes and lessons that can be"
284,250,0.322,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"designed as a payment for environmental services â that is, a voluntary transaction where a well-deï¬ned service (or a land-use system likely to secure that service) is being âbought by a buyer from a provider, if and only if the provider secures the service provisionâ (Wunder, 2005). REDD is based on the idea that it is possible to reduce deforestation by offering economic compensation to forest users for not changing the use of forestlands. It is seen as a winâwin approach that would potentially address the trade-offs between forest conservation and economic development. Some analysts claim that REDD projects have the potential to generate enough money to end deforestation in tropical countries (Nepstad et al., 2009). Although originally presented as an âapoliticalâ technological ï¬x (cf. Li, 2007), REDD has encountered much criticism, and early proposals faced ï¬erce political resistance. The neoliberal idea of the commodiï¬cation of nature seemed repellent to individuals and even to countries, which fear that developed countries would use their economic power to increase or leave unaddressed their carbon emissions at the expense of developing countries. There were also fears that REDD would beneï¬t actors who have historically been responsible for deforestation, such as ranchers and large-scale farmers, while excluding the less privileged forest-dwellers, who cannot bear the transaction costs of carbon markets and do not even have the title to their lands (Boyd, Gutierrez and Chang, 2007; Blom, Sunderland and Murdiyarso, 2010). REDD proved to be much more complex than a simple carbon-market arrangement. Since it is a project âin the makingâ, it necessarily leaves room for bargaining and negotiations as to how forest and climate policies will take shape in speciï¬c contexts. As a result, REDD quickly moved from strictly carbon storage to having multiple objectives, including biodiversity conservation and the enhancement of local livelihoods (Angelsen and McNeill, 2012). This even more complex mechanism is not yet settled. There are important struggles at international, national and local levels to deï¬ne how REDD should be implemented. REDD can be seen as a multilevel project of environmental governance. By environmental governance we mean âa set of mechanisms, formal and informal institutions and practices by way of which social order is produced through controlling that which is related to the environment and natural resourcesâ (Bull and Aguilar-StÃ¸en, 2015: 5). Some decisions regarding REDD are taken at the global level, other decisions are taken at the national level and ï¬nally actions, projects and initiatives are implemented at the local level. This complexity might result in the hybridization of REDD, and, as the idea is appropriated by different"

They offer selected support services to facilitate the implementation of the policies they promote. The Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP), whose goal is to improve access to modern energy services for the poor, for instance, provides training to entrepreneurs and financial intermediaries.18 Another good example is the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), a global partnership between over 200 organisations, business and non-profits to expand the development of renewable energy.19 REEEP provides training to financial institutions and sometimes seeds funding for the establishment of funds for energy projects. 4.1.4 Information-generating partnerships Finally, there is a set of partnerships tasked with generating information on behalf of others. Where information is disputed or multiple agents face a collective action problem in generating it, partnerships can contribute to the solution of public policy problems by providing it. This can refer to different kinds of information. In the case of the WCD, for instance, the partnership was called upon to provide an impartial assessment of the effects of a controversial practice. The Marine Stewardship Council, an initiative to improve the health of the worldâs oceans and create a sustainable global seafood market, by contrast, verifies and certifies the compliance of businesses with its principles and code of conduct.20"

The selï¬sh-competitive actor view therefore concluded that only private property rights or strict state control was suitable to deter such action. As a consequence we frequently hear about market failure or state failure when this is not successful. Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom, one of the leading thinkers that inspired this movement, rejected the universal law that all humans are selï¬sh and that policy or competition somehow have to rein in their destructive actions. She and her colleagues also took a closer look at whether there are really only two types of goods that would justify being satisï¬ed with two prototypical governance solutions.

241,282,0.321,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The wind climate, described through the statistics of nearsurface wind speed and direction, has a strong impact on human activities and the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Extreme wind speeds are a direct threat to life and property and an indirect threat through wind waves, storm surges (Chap. 9) and coastal erosion (Chap. 20) leading to high economic loss. However, on the European scale at least, no trends were found for storm losses adjusted for inflation and changes in population and wealth in the period 1970â2008 (Barredo 2010). Nilsson et al. (2004) calculated a storm damage index for Sweden for the period 1901â2000 based on storms sufï¬cient to cause forest damage. Although the 1980s suffered most extreme storm events in terms of windthrow, the authors noted several factors other than wind that increased or decreased storm damage. Widespread and severe damage usually relates to severe winter storms. A positive NAO index is generally associated with an increased number of extreme cyclones although they can also occur at negative phases of the NAO (Pinto et al. 2009). Among others, typical examples of severe winter storms causing widespread damage in the last decade have been Gudrun/Erwin on 8/9 January 2005 (HaanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al. 2006; Suursaar et al. 2006) and Kyrill on 18/19 January 2007 (Fink et al. 2009).

347,107,0.321,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"current system. Any scientific analysis is only as good as the data used, and data on fish stocks gathered by survey vessels and partially validated by fisheriesâ data is often unreliable and always incomplete. Further, ecosystems such as maritime environments are a dynamic entity with stochastic effects and uncertain dynamics. There are increasing calls for improved concepts of uncertainty treatment and improved methodology in the characterisation, consideration, communication and management of uncertainty for scientific assessment and advice. It has been argued, for example, by Dankel et al. (2012), that a better understanding of how to characterise scientific uncertainty and its implications are needed. However, according to our interviewees, the underlying problem has still not been resolved, namely, that DG MARE wants numbers, whilst ICESâs scientists prefer to give more qualitative and nuanced information. This poses a fundamental problem for the whole management process: ICES is expected to deliver recommendations as sound and clear as possible in order for DG MARE to draft proposals for action. ICESâ advice, on the other hand, has to be legitimate and definitive, i.e. it cannot be open to different interpretations by different stakeholders (Wilson 2009: 124). That there is uncertainty, however, has to be somehow communicated for the advice to become credible, but how exactly uncertainty should and can be communicated to DG MARE is an ongoing discussion, not least because of different understandings of uncertainty between ICES and DG MARE. This is referred to as âinstitutional uncertaintyâ (Linke et al. 2014). Industry representatives in all countries generally felt more comfortable with management decisions made by the Council of Ministers, partly because the latter did not fully follow the advice of ICES. Industrialists felt that NGOs read ICESâ advice all too literally. They on the other hand understood the uncertainties involved and thus expected decision makers to set different TACs than those of ICES. Unsurprisingly, NGO representatives were very much in favour of the precautionary approach to scientific uncertainties. They felt that given the lack of or the unreliability of data, the precautionary approach would better address concerns of sustainable management of resources. Representatives from ICES on the other hand were less perturbed. They saw themselves as delivering a service to DG MARE based on the available resources and knowledge. In their view, their assessment was mainly a biologicalâeconomic one. They did not see a threat of species extinction. Rather, they were concerned that if TACs were set too high, economic problems might arise. DG MARE representatives saw the problem similarly and referred mainly to the challenges of data reliability and communication of uncertainty. Further, they felt that local and anecdotal knowledge about fish stocks should be taken seriously."
222,618,0.321,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"variables. They do so using nationally representative samples of households from which inferences concerning national trends can be drawn, and the patterns of poverty and well-being are developed. Use of the Bangladesh HIES by Szabo et al. (2016) showed how food security at the household level is negatively associated with creeping salinity in the study area. Yet these data sources are limited in information about the direct benefits people derive from their ecosystems, about their mobility and other responses, and on the health and well-being of populations. Hence the survey here provides a unique set of insights on human-environment relations in this delta. As highlighted in Chap. 21, ecosystem services are highly variable in space and time. This bespoke survey therefore builds in temporal variability by repeat interviews in three waves over a full calendar year: the analysis constructs detailed livelihood calendars. A further challenge for human-environment models is the multi-dimensional and contested nature of poverty, both as manifest in lack of material assets, an absence of health and also as a lived experience (Baulch 1996). Hence the survey is comprehensive in collecting specific variables that facilitate interdisciplinary analyses and consideration of material and subjective measurements of well-being alongside use of ecosystem services and livelihood diversity. It allows multilevel analysis and intra-household analyses: variables relate to individual men and women and to whole households. This chapter first briefly outlines the survey methodology and implementation (Sect. 23.2). Section 23.3 summarises the data available from the household survey; it highlights unique variables and aspects of the survey and those that are comparable with other standard datasets. Section 23.4 describes each of the publicly available datasets associated with the household survey, illustrated with selected descriptive statistics. The publicly available datasets are land cover data by Union for the field area in Khulna and Barisal Divisions, household listing data of 9,300 households, a household roster dataset that presents separately the basic data of the 8,000 people living in the households surveyed and three rounds of household survey data for approximately 1,500 separate households taking into account attrition between the three rounds. The chapter closes with a reflection on the reuse potential of the dataset. All data are available to download from the ReShare UK-based online data repository.1 The data are accompanied by English and Bengali versions of the questionnaire, as well as a glossary of terms used in the questionnaire. The survey design process itself is described in more detail in Adams et al. (2016)."

10,104,0.321,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"et al. 2012; Bressers et al. 2013, 2015). The structural context influences the process not only through its direct contents, but also through its extent and coherence (Knoepfel et al. 2001, 2003; Bressers and Kuks 2004). The extent refers to the completeness of the regime. The coherence is the degree to which the various elements of the regime are strengthening rather than weakening each other. Regimes with an insufï¬cient extent are by deï¬nition weak as guardians of sustainable use of water resources, while some relevant parts of the domain go unregulated. Most of the time, growing complexity is an answer to real needs and developments. As a matter of fact, societies in modern times have generally grown into a situation of increased complexity. Increased populations, borders, overlaps, activities, rivalries, etc. are a fact of our current living environments. A growing complexity in governance can be viewed as a logical adaptation to that development (Gerrits 2008; Teisman et al. 2009). Many external change agents, such as technological developments, add new scales, new actors, new problem perceptions, new instruments, and new responsibilities to the existing ones. The essence of extent is not the number of involved scales, actors, perceptions, instruments and resources as such, but rather the degree to which these are complete in reflecting what is relevant for the policy or project. In that sense it should not be mistaken for another way of making a descriptive inventory like with the descriptive questions. By coherence we mean the following: When more than one layer of government is dealing with the same natural resource (as is often the case), then coherence means inter alia that the activities of these layers of government are recognised as mutually dependent and influencing each otherâsâ effects. Likewise if more than one scale is relevant the interaction effects between those scales should be considered. When more than one actor (stakeholder) is involved in the policy, coherence means that there is a substantial degree of interaction in the policy network, and preferably productive interaction providing coordination capacity. When more than one use or user is causing the problem of unsustainable resource use for example, coherence means that the various resulting objectives are analysed in one framework so that deliberate choices can be made if and when goals and/or uses are conflicting. When the actors involved have problem perceptions that start from different angles, coherence means that they are capable of integrating these to such an extent that a common ground for productive deliberation on ambitions is created. The same holds for instrumental strategies that are used to attain the different objectives, as well as for the different instruments in a mix to attain one of these objectives. Coherence of the organisation of implementation means that responsibilities and resources of various persons or organisations that are to contribute to the application of the policy are co-ordinated, or these actors themselves are co-ordinated. In the implementation process, the additional fragmentation that is typical for complex but non coherent regimes will tend to lead to more discord between the actors (goals), more uncertainty (cognitions), and more stalemates (power) and, thereby, can hamper implementation. In the implementation process, coherence of the structural context (the regime) will tend to lead to less discord (due to more âwin-winââsolution creativity), less (subjective) uncertainty (due to more exchange of information and less distrust) and less stalemates (due to less possibilities for"

378,189,0.321,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"supply chain interruptions when transport or credit in one part of the chain is hampered. Meanwhile, sustainable communities, according to Hopkins, do not subscribe to a culture of consumerism but seek to link âsatisfaction and happiness to other less tangible things like community, meaningful work, skills and friendshipâ (Hopkins 2012: 20â21). Here we ï¬nd a direct connection with ï¬ndings on human well-being and its origins. It was insightful to see that some workshops of the Transition Town movement were using Max-Neefâs human need matrix to discuss a diversity of strategies for a high quality of life beyond âhavingâ things. This also ties back to the criticism of ecological economists like Paul Ekins and Robert Costanza in Chap. 3, who state that the social utility gained through the human interactions during production processes should get much more attention when assessing productivity. Meanwhile, many resilience researchers also emphasize the importance of trust as a core ingredient to well-functioning, adaptable communities and individual perceptions of well-being. The 2012 High Level Panel on Global Sustainability did not get this far in its report to the UN Secretary-General before Rio+20. Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A Future Worth Choosing describes the world system as volatile and uncertain, and suggests that the panel start their recommendations with a call to âempower people to make sustainable choicesâ as a response to this. It does not seek to empower people to build their own communities though, but rather focuses on how the social safety nets of governments are set up so they can be resilient in times of structural change, and how disaster risk reduction and adaptation programs could be improved (United Nations Secretary-Generalâs High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2012: 46â47). The Transition movement, on the other hand, makes these self-empowerment processes the essence of its existence and adapts them to systems or communities of any size, not just towns. Its mission is summarized as follows: âto inspire, encourage, connect, support and train communities as they adopt and adapt the transition model on their journey to urgently rebuild resilience and drastically reduce CO2 emissions.â The seven principles for guiding such processes in towns are set out by Hopkins and Peter Lipman on the Transition Network website (transitionnetwork.org) and can be summarized as follows: 1. Positive Visioning: Campaigning for rather than against something. 2. Help People Access Good Information and Trust Them to Make Good Decisions: Raising awareness and hearing many opinions lies at the core of rational decision-making. 3. Inclusion and Openness: Banning âthem and usâ thinking and reaching out to all subsystems in the town, early in the process. 4. Enable Sharing and Networking: Acknowledge everything, including stories of failure. 5. Build Resilience: With the primacy of environmental resilience, change food, energy and economic systems in the town and across governance levels."
365,123,0.321,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"advantage of modern molecular biology, including genetic modification, should be considered as part of the solution to climate change (Zilberman 2015) These new technologies have significant potential for fast adaptation and reduced human footprint, and the resistance to such technologies can be counterproductive.5 The notion of sustainable development recognizes that dynamic processes are occurring and realities are changing. It aims to enhance human development and growth while protecting human well-being and environmental quality (Zilberman 2014). A defensive environmental strategy justifies mitigation and mechanisms to address it, such as carbon tax, but may provide obstacles to adaptation. For example, with climate change, some areas that are considered wilderness will have to be converted to agricultural use. Thus, zoning will need to be flexible to accommodate changing conditions."
198,89,0.321,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"there is widespread agreement that to mainstream, replicate, reproduce, upgrade or upscale interventions to higher levels is an essential perspective in understanding causal pathways from the micro-level to higher level goals. Garcia and Zazueta (2015) argue that at higher scales interventions should be interpreted and looked at from a systems perspective. Individual components and elements do not a system make, but when they start interacting, they tend to take on characteristics of a system, which can have its own dynamics and shifts and changes. Arguably markets operate as systems and market change is systemic change: subtle changes in supply, demand and enabling environment can lead to âtipping pointsâ, after which slow, reversible change becomes irreversible, or the point in time at which a new technology (such as hydel power) becomes mainstream. In conclusion key questions related to time lead to the realisation that impact can be measured at each moment in time â ex ante as impact assessment, through modelling and calculations, real time through monitoring, experimental design, trend analysis etc. and ex post through various evaluations and studies. Key questions related to space make us realise that impact differs per area and that areas have different impacts. Key questions related to scale point to the need to mainstream, replicate, upscale and broaden the scope of interventions before impact can be achieved at higher levels."
169,855,0.321,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"efforts into restoring and protecting less-impacted rivers in order to successfully provide other ecosystem services (see Chap. 15). Apparently, where, when, and how to restore rivers are not trivial questions that should be answered by gut decisions but require scientiï¬cally based knowledge of ecosystem functioning, underlying mechanisms of restoration processes, and involvement of all relevant stakeholders. While the need for inter- and transdisciplinarity has been invoked so many times that they have become worn-out buzzwords, they remain as concepts that are rarely applied in routine river management. As solutions are not straightforward and may only evolve over time, we cannot manage only based on certainty. We must manage by learning along the way what needs to be done. In that context, the principle of adaptive management seems an appropriate way to manage under very uncertain conditions, e.g., climate change, by using comprehensive monitoring of the human/ecosystem to periodically challenge our science and policies within structured learning cycles (see Chap. 16). One might say that restoring rivers for ecological purposes is a luxury only rich countries can afford. However, when it comes to providing essential or wellappreciated services for human beings (e.g., water supply, ï¬sheries, or recreation), the functioning of riverine ecosystems becomes the foundation of sustainable development (see Chaps. 14, 27 and 28). Therefore, the concept of ecosystem services is very helpful to make the linkage between ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services better understandable for stakeholders and the public and apply it more widely in river management (Chap. 21). The importance of ecosystem services will only increase as society adapts to climate change by lowering the use of fossil fuels, which were used initially to replace ecosystem services. If fossil fuels can no longer provide alternative services, then ecosystem-driven services must be enhanced to replace them. Environmental movements triggered societal transformations and redirected the research agenda. However, environmental movements come and go, and economic crises can easily remove environmental tasks from the political agenda, as seen recently. Therefore, the institutionalized involvement of stakeholders and interested public in decision processes is very important to keep the dialog on environmental issues alive. NGOs play a critical role in this process, but openness of all participating actors (decision makers, administration, stakeholders, NGO, science) is required to elaborate sound and widely accepted solutions (see Chap. 23). Finally, adequate capacity building and educational programs taking up the challenges in riverine ecosystem management are required to guarantee sustainable development of riverine ecosystems in the long run (see Chap. 22). Aquatic ecosystems such as rivers will become increasingly important in sustaining and improving our quality of life by providing such services as food, water, transport, and the aesthetics that deï¬ne a region. The science of understanding and managing rivers cannot provide the luxury of high certainty anymore, which we now understand was an illusion in the ï¬rst place. However, in an increasingly unpredictable world, it can provide the best questions, methods, and potential solutions to test as society adapts to uncertainty. As improved restoration efforts return the natural beauty of river valleys to many regions of the world, river science will become a vital bridge between the integrity of nature and of society."
87,772,0.321,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","â¢ Reduce dependence on non-renewable resources. â¢ Mitigate and adapt climate change. â¢ Create jobs and maintain competitiveness especiallyâbut not exclusivelyâin rural areas. Whereas the challenges to be addressed are widely known and accepted, the question of how these goals can be achieved, i.e. how an economy can be transformed into a bioeconomy, is still at the centre of scientific, political, and societal debate. Historical evidence from recent decades demonstrates societyâs essential role in any successful transformation of systems. Norms, values, and thus behavioural patterns, along with the degree of acceptance and the willingness to support changes, are as important as technological and economic factors (Verbong and Loorbach 2012). These norms and values shape the preferences of what a future bioeconomy should look like. Any thinking about the future is accompanied by uncertainties and relevant but as yet unknown processes within and outside the control of stakeholders. The development of potentially successful strategies for dealing with uncertainties on the way to a bioeconomy requires instruments and tools to depict possible transition paths. This chapter provides the reader with a number of instruments and tools, without claiming to be comprehensive. To identify future possibilities, scenarios have increasingly been used in the past decades. They address complexities and uncertainties by explicitly acknowledging that different futures are possible and that reliable, long-term predictions in the field of sociotechnical transition are not possible (Grunwald 2011). Scenarios aim to explore and develop potential or desirable future states and development pathways. One established approach is to combine scenarios with models (Poganietz et al. 2000). Models can reveal interdependencies between resources, production, consumption, markets and sectors, and the environment."
378,24,0.321,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"health, but also encompass goals and targets for improved work situations, income distribution, more sustainable growth patterns and city developments as well as resource efï¬ciency, clean energy and the protection of marine and land ecosystems. Two of the goals also provide targets for governance improvements and the quality of institutions and partnerships, which should help the implementation process (UN 2015). Some critics may lament that these goals are pipe dreams, too ambitious and sometimes contradictory, given that the socioeconomic pledges can only be realized if the targets for environmental protection are missed. I think that this will certainly be the case if the spirit of transformation and radical change that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed in his 2014 preparatory report on reaching the SDGs is lost. Ki-moon wrote, âTransformation is our watchword. At this moment in time, we are called to lead and act with courage. We are called to embrace change. Change in our societies. Change in the management of our economies. Change in our relationship with our one and only planetâ (UN 2014: 3). It is this spirit of transformation that I want to support with this book. To me it holds a renewed window of opportunity for the radical changes that in essence the sustainable development agenda always held. And I want to show that radicalness in purpose should not be conflated with a call for instant revolution, tearing down the system or hostility to dissenting ideas. Radicalness in purpose is equivalent to holding a vision or belief in what could be possible if X, Y or Z was to change, an imaginary that stirs up energy, commitmentâand persistence in taking the many incremental steps required to get there. Sociologists use the term âimaginaryâ to capture more than ideas: it includes a set of values, institutions, laws and symbols with which people imagine their social whole. Without this combination of radical imaginary and persistent progress toward it, not much transformation will happen, at least not in the direction of sustainable development. The path dependencies that shape humanityâs activities and development dynamics today are pushing and pulling in a decidedly non-sustainable direction. This is why I also want to make the case that we should not simply stick the label âtransformationâ on any amendment to the status quo, or call each technological efï¬ciency gain an âinnovation.â If the benchmark for the changes to which we aspire is not radically different to the one that has guided development solutions so far, humanity will not escape those strong path dependencies. At the same time, dismissing the role that incremental steps play in getting there means ignoring the insights that complex system research offers about patterns of change. So juxtaposing the two approaches as entirely separate strategiesâa practice often used to discredit someone elseâs proposalsâdoes not help. What helps is to keep each other challenged with respect to both the radicalness of the imagined outcomes (what do we deem possible) and the amount of change in this direction that the next, often little, steps could bring (what do we do to make it happen). This book speaks to this combination under the tagline of radical incremental transformation strategies. The purpose that these strategies should serve here is long-term sustainable development as deï¬ned in the Rio Declaration of 1992 and"
246,3,0.321,Rewilding European Landscapes,"incorporated in a wider strategy to restore natural disturbance regimes and natural succession. This book brings together contributions from thirty authors across nine different countries to discuss rewilding of abandoned landscapes in Europe. We bring together scientists and practitioners, as rewilding is at the interface of science and society, and we target as well an audience of thinkers and doers. We do not shy away from controversy or critical views, and some of the chapters present different perspectives from the book editorsâ on how to manage biodiversity and farmland abandonment. The book has a clear European focus, but the approaches, results and discussion is certainly relevant worldwide, as abandonment is at least a local phenomenon in all parts of the world. The first part of the book aims at developing the basis of a theory of rewilding. Chapter 1 by Pereira and Navarro lays out the basic ideas for the book, and is a reprint of our original paper on this topic in the journal Ecosystems. The chapter questions traditional paradigms of managers and scientists on European landscapes, such as the sustainability of traditional farming practices, the quality of life of rural populations, and the efforts to maintain museum landscapes. The authors argue that farmland abandonment is inexorable and that concerns with negative impacts on biodiversity may be unfounded as the relationship between species diversity and land-use has not been examined at large scales. The authors identify winner and looser species of rewilding and argue that rewilding can drive important changes in community composition. The chapter examines the benefits of rewilding based on an ecosystem service framework, and concludes by identifying some challenges associated with rewilding such as conflicts with wildlife and limits to ecological resilience. Chapter 2, by CeauÈu and colleagues, discusses the concept of wilderness by analyzing how it can be mapped in space. The chapter briefly reviews the historical concepts of wilderness and wilderness metrics, discussing the subjectivity of wilderness perception. The authors map wilderness areas in Europe using four concepts: (1) remoteness from roads and settlements; (2) absence of light pollution; (3) distance to potential natural vegetation; and (4) proportion of primary productivity harvested by humans. They show that wilderness areas are concentrated in high latitudes and in mountainous regions and that they overlap with areas of high megafauna species richness. Surprisingly, they find even higher values of wilderness in areas of Natura 2000 than in the nationally protected areas. Finally, the authors argue that farmland abandonment will occur in areas of intermediate wilderness values, releasing additional areas for wild ecosystems. Chapter 3, by Cerqueira and colleagues, examines the consequences of rewilding for ecosystem services. Using a spatial map of the distribution of the different types of ecosystem services in Europe, the authors investigate the spatial distribution of indicators of ecosystem services in Europe before analyzing the spatial overlap between wilderness and areas delivering provisioning, regulating and cultural services. They then proceed to a quantitative analysis of the average supply of services between areas of wilderness, areas under agricultural use, and areas projected to be abandoned. Their analysis suggests that wilderness areas provide important"

Finally, we emphasize that the responses to climate change may consist both of incremental adaptation, primarily based on scaling up existing technologies and modifying institutions, laws and regulations, and transformative adaptation, including new institutions and major reallocation of resources over space and time. These responses vary in their time dimension and are interdependent (Nelson et al. 2007). Since policy planning addresses multiple objectives, such as higher incomes, more stable incomes, and lower emissions, one of the key areas of focus is highlighting potential trade-offs in meeting multiple objectives. The goal is to be able to evaluate which policy actions can ameliorate trade-offs and harness synergies amongst the multiple objectives. The latter is particularly important since meeting increasing global food demand and local food security objectives requires continued growth in the agricultural sector. There are a number of potential trade-offs that can arise due to impacts from climate change. For instance, increased frequency of extreme weather events increases the value of policy actions that reduce household vulnerability to such events, but may also compromise strategies to enhance average growth levels of agricultural productivity and farmer incomes. Similarly, policies and public investments to address uncertain longer-term shifts in weather patterns can shift resources away from addressing current poverty alleviation goals. Pursuing low-emissions growth strategies can also involve trade-offs with near-medium term growth objectives, which need to be clearly understood â and externally financed â in order to avoid placing additional burdens on smallholders in developing countries. Understanding the potential impacts of climate extremes and shifting climate patterns and evaluating how different options and strategies can best address these is a complicated process. As a beginning step, the Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) concept was developed in order to address the complex issue of how to achieve sustainable agricultural growth for food security under climate change (FAO 2009, 2010; Lipper et al. 2014). The concept calls for integration of the need for adaptation and the possibility of GHG mitigation in agricultural growth and poverty reduction strategies. However there is considerable confusion about what the CSA concept and approach actually involve, and wide variation in how the term is used. At this time, it is critical to build a more formal basis for the CSA concept and methodology and at the same time provide illustrations of how the concept can be applied across a range of conditions. This is the primary focus of this book."

Individual cases of humans or cattle lives lost were well known among villagers,âunderscoring these events as âspecialâ or ânewsâ to villagers. When told of the GOEâs estimates of lost people and livestock, all informants were either angry or scoffed at such accounts. The 2006 flood waters were not even strong enough at the mouth of the Omo River to cause many ï¬shers to cease ï¬shing or suffer damage to their nets and other equipment during the approximately ten day high flood waters. Villagers near the riverâs terminus at the lakeâfor example, at Lopeleleâdescribe continued active ï¬shing by both Turkana and Dasanech at the time. They also described the Ethio-Fisheries Corporation as remaining in the main channel for ï¬shing during the flood. In other words, all three groups of ï¬shers continued their activity throughout the floodâs duration, while agriculturalists and pastoralists moved laterally from the river to await its return to a lower level. â¢ Crops were submerged, but this was universally described as an exception from the predominant experience over many years of Omo flooding, with success in recession agriculture when they were fortunate enough to receive âenoughâ water."

55,21,0.32,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"the historical background, by illustrating the approaches to a series of basic problems, is limited to what might be described as the ânatural historyâ of human and animal mycoses.30 While we agree with Ainsworth on the point that the development of medical mycology was a phenomenon of the twentieth century, our work differs in two ways. First, we do not take the specialism of medical mycology as given, or historically constant, rather as a social institution that had to be created and sustained. Second, we do not set out a lineage of ideas, but rather discuss changing knowledges in specific institutional and social settings, and also explore practices and meanings.31 The history of medical mycology in the United States in the twentieth century has been described in great detail in a monograph by Ana Victoria Espinel-Ingroff published in 2006.32 Her narrative is comprehensive and wonderfully rich in characters and institutional detail. It focuses on training and mapping the professional networks that have shaped medical mycology across the country. At the same time, the author tells the story of discoveries in the understanding and management of the main fungal infections that affect Americans. It is history informed by disciplinary politics, as Espinel-Ingroffâs reference point is what she sees as a crisis in medical mycology in the United States. On the one hand, the importance of mycoses has grown with their increased prevalence and the arrival of effective antifungal drugs. Yet, on the other hand, the field seems to be fragmenting, being drawn at one end to molecular approaches and basic biology, and at the other to applied clinical research, leading to the neglect of the old, middle ground of taxonomy, aetiology, physiology and pathogenesis. Woven into Espinel-Ingroffâs history narrative is a narrative of developments in the field in the twentieth century, with five periods defining her chapters. The discussion of the âEra of Discovery (1894â1919)â explores how work on fungi followed that in bacteriology in seeking the causal organisms of specific infections and the understanding of basic fungal biology. The âFormative Years (1920â1949)â are characterised by the establishment of training programmes, laboratory services and epidemiological studies of common diseases, such as athleteâs foot and thrush, or the then very rare systemic mycoses. The period 1950â1969, the âAdvent of Antifungal and Immunosuppressive Therapiesâ, was dominated by drug discoveries (nystatin, amphotericin B, griseofulvin) and the increased incidence of severe opportunistic systemic fungal infections that were linked to antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapies. The âYears of Expansion (1970â1979)â are portrayed as the apogee of"

Consequently, recommended focus areas for action are urban regeneration and the improvement of well-being (pp. 16â17). Generally, NBS can be seen as a positive way to employ nature more explicitly for a sustainable planning of urban areas including the involvement of the political and economic sphere. And without doubt, there are great opportunities for using green infrastructure or instruments for cost-effective, innovative and healthy solutions that, at the same time, contribute to quality of life and a successful economic performance of a city. However, two issues must be considered critically here: First, it seems that the NBS approach as defined by the EC and also by IUCN seeks to adapt older concepts such as urban green infrastructure (UGI) or urban ecosystem services (UES) still closer to the economy-related and business-oriented sector. It employs a very business-friendly and de-politicised understanding of urban nature and sustainability and should especially invite developers and investors to take part in their creation, realization and implementation. I am fully in line with Potschin et al. (2015, p. 2) here who demand that: Yet, a clear link between NBS and these concepts is needed to ensure consistency and avoid redundancy or confusion."

365,23,0.32,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Climate change poses a major and growing threat to global food security. Population growth and rising incomes in much of the developing world have pushed demand for food and other agricultural products to unprecedented levels. FAO has estimated that, in order to meet food demand in 2050, annual world production of crops and livestock will need to be 60% higher than it was in 2006. In developing countries, about 80% of the required increase will need to come from higher yields and increased cropping intensity and only 20% from expansion of arable land1. Meeting food demand for a growing population is already a formidable challenge for the agriculture sector, but it will be further exacerbated by climate change. The expected effects of climate change â higher temperatures, extreme weather events, water shortages, rising sea levels, the disruption of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity â will generate significant effects on the different dimensions and determinants of food security by affecting the productivity of rainfed crops and forage, reducing water availability and changing the severity and distribution of crop and livestock diseases. The fifth assessment report of the IPCC released in 2014 found that climate change effects are already being felt on agriculture and food security, and the negative impacts are most likely in tropical zones where most of the worldâs poor agricultural dependent populations are located. Through its impacts on agriculture, climate change will make it more difficult to meet the key Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger, achieving year-round food security, and ensuring sustainable food production systems by 2030. The magnitude and speed of climate change, and the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation efforts in agriculture, will be critical to the future of large segments of the worldâs population. Integrating the effects of climate change into agricultural development planning is a major challenge. This requires technology and policy measures to reduce vulnerability and increase the capacity of producers, particularly smallholders, to effectively adapt. At the same time, given agricultureâs role as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and the high rate of emissions growth experienced with recent conventional intensification strategies, there is a need to look for low emissions growth opportunities and adequate policies. Policymakers are thus challenged to ensure that agriculture contributes to addressing food security, development and climate change. In this frame, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach that calls for integration of the need for adaptation and the possibility of mitigation in agricultural growth strategies to support food security. The concept was launched by FAO in 20102, gaining rapid and widespread interest and attention. CSA goes beyond agricultural practices and technologies to include enabling policies and institutions as well as identification of financing mechanisms. There are significant intellectual and policy gaps to be filled in CSA literature. An economic decision-making framework will also assist in identifying challenges for CSA application."
180,547,0.32,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"The cases presented in this chapter illustrate some of the ethical challenges raised by public health research. These challenges range from compliance with research ethics guidelines to the need to address the economic and political implications from the wider societal context in which public health research occurs. Social, economic, and political factors can directly lead to ethical challenges or may affect a researcherâs ability to comply with ethical guidelines. The case by Boulanger and Hunt illustrates how well-intentioned international efforts to improve access to health care in resource-poor countries can have unintended consequences that present ethical complications. The case raises various interconnected issues that have to do with researchersâ responsibilities and obligations and with conflicts between individual and public goods. Within a collaborative international public health research project, such conflicts can easily arise when local investigators find themselves serving multiple roles that create potential conflicts of interest. Boulanger and Hunt provide an excellent summary of the responsibilities and obligations of researchers, including to â¢ Protect participants from harm and ensure they benefit from the research whenever possible; â¢ Support and protect research staff, especially students; â¢ Support and respect research collaborators, building local capacity when possible; and â¢ Support the research enterprise, which includes building public trust, maximizing the relevance and usefulness of the research, and disseminating findings. Central to this case is a local researcherâs uncovering of how informal fees for obstetric care are being diverted to senior hospital administrators. The local researcher has a dilemma. If he reveals this ethically dubious informal fee structure, he will not only jeopardize his standing at the hospital, but he could also undermine the availability of obstetric care to women in his community. The director of the research program must ethically weigh the research goal of improving access to health care services with supporting the interests of the research staff while also maintaining good relations with local health agencies. In many contexts, this case would be a clear-cut whistleblower issue demanding revelation. However, where informal fees are standard practice, part of the political culture, or the health infrastructure is already fragile or minimal, the issue becomes complicated, forcing one to prioritize competing values and moral considerations."
364,395,0.319,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Near-natural restoration is both a method and a theory. Its meaning surpasses ecology, embracing a philosophy of âharmony between man and nature.â Since the era of the Warring States (720â221 bc), the Chinese have investigated the harmonious relationship among Tian (heaven or universe), Di (earth or resource), and Ren (people or society), advocating the union of man and nature. From these investigations, a systematic set of principles for managing the relationship between man and the environment was developed. In particular, principles of holism, symbiosis, circulation and self-reliance were emphasized (Wong and Bradshaw 2008). In successive phases, appropriate native species were selected, relevant communities from the pioneer to senior phase were built, and each phase of the food cycle was connected, to enable the forest or water system to become a self-maintaining, recycling, living ecosystem. Numerous restoration projects and studies have shown that near-natural restoration could provide ample ecological benefits and enhance environmental quality with minimal human maintenance and a small initial"

This chapter brings together a series of manuscripts focused on different international initiatives directed towards the reduction of disaster risk associated with landslides. The nine papers in this issue reveal different technical and practical perspectives to assess different aspects of landslide disaster risk under varies spatio-temporal scenarios. Mapping approaches and results reflect a series of problems related to data availability at various scales, including local, national, regional and global levels, while social analysis are highly complex as landslide disaster risk perception is shaped through experience and is strongly influenced by context. Combining instrumentation, monitoring and awareness has been also depicted as a major strategy for the preservation of World Heritage Sites, although this approach can be with no doubt, applied to Geoparks, Geomorphosites and other relevant sites that require protection."

The temporal structure of LHC data is particularly suitable for accounting for these aspects and can be used for performing sequence analysis event-history analysis or other longitudinal models (Axinn and Barber 2001; Axinn et al. 1999). Last but not least the interpretation of events is at the same time a dependent and an independent variable in the study of vulnerability. The same event can assume very different meanings and affect peoplesâ lives in very different ways. For instance members of different social classes or members of the same class may not experience losing a job or being fired in the same way. Thus an event that for one person can start a dangerous domino effect may be a minor problem for another person. In addition the meaning attached to events is culturally and socially embedded. Losing a job in a period of economic crisis may be a different experience compared to losing it in a period of economic growth. On the other hand in a period of crisis the loss of the job becomes sadly common while in other historical periods it could represent a less likely and for this reason more stigmatizing experience (Oesch and Lipps 2012). The interpretation of events and their relationships with the socialhistorical contexts are tightly related and researchers can address them both easily in two ways with LHCs. Data in LHCs are both connected to temporalâi.e. the year in which events occurredâand spatial dimensionâi.e. where the respondent was located at the time the event occurred. This makes it possible to relate events to places and consequently to social and historical contexts. In addition LHCs can allow a retrospective evaluation of events providing information on individual interpretations of life trajectories. This is probably one of the less developed uses of LHCs although it is central to the study of vulnerability. In the next section we present some experiences with using LHCs to tap the three processes of diffusion accumulation and interpretation as examples of the use of LHCs to survey vulnerability."
224,101,0.319,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"In the opposite direction of causality, one finds natural resources (such as timber, or mining products) being extracted preferably in low density areas, which boosts the metabolic rates in these regions. High density areas are instead only the consumers of these resources, and the âupstream flowsâ do not weigh on their metabolic rates. This difference was considered so striking that UNEP based its scenarios of future resource use on the assumption that developing countries, over the coming decades, would tend to emulate the metabolic rates of industrial countries but maintain differences according to population density (UNEP 2011). Nevertheless, the IRP came to the conclusion that the already ongoing continuation of metabolic convergence would lead to an untenable level of global resource use, running up not only against all climate concerns but also against global resource constraints (fossil fuels, metals). Thus, Boserup, in contrast to most of her contemporaries, correctly viewed population growth and density increase not just as rising but also as alleviating environmental burdens."
365,534,0.319,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The AgMIP RIA methods are designed to assess vulnerability of farm households to climate change. We define a climate as a probability distribution of weather events that occur at a specific place and during a defined period of time. A change in climate is a change in the probability distribution of weather events. These changes are often described in terms of the mean temperature over a period of time such as a day, month or year, but can also be changes in temperature extremes, the variability of weather events, and other aspects such as rainfall amount and intensity and wind velocity. Impacts of climate change are quantified as gains and losses in economic wellbeing (e.g., farm income or per capita income) or other metrics of well-being (e.g., changes in health or environmental quality). In this framework, some or all individuals may gain or lose from a change, and we say the losers are vulnerable to loss from climate change. The AgMIP RIA methodology is designed to quantify the proportion of the population that are losers, as well as the magnitude of loss. It is important to note, however, that in a heterogeneous population there are typically some gainers and some losers, and thus the net impact may be positive or negative. The AgMIP RIA method is designed to quantify climate vulnerability by modeling a heterogeneous population of farm households rather than modeling a ârepresentativeâ or average or typical farm. This approach begins with the representation of impacts on the farm household using the concept of economic gains and losses (other metrics of impact can be also be used depending on available data, e.g., the impact on health of household members). As Fig. 3 shows, the AgMIP RIA approach uses a statistical representation of the farming system in a heterogeneous region or population to quantify the distribution of gains and losses, e.g., due to climate change. Figure 4 illustrates this idea with two loss distributions. The area under the distribution on the positive side of zero is the proportion of losers and is the measure"

365,608,0.319,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"While we have not yet formally modeled policies to expand agricultural extension, nearly all of the comparative statics described above could be influenced by it. If, for example, an increase in extension efforts helps farmers understand that appropriate fertilizer applications can increase their yields, then this is tantamount to a change in the function f to the farmer. Similarly, if extension provides farmers with new information about diversification opportunities or new agricultural techniques, this translates into a change in the function g from the farmerâs perspective. Since f and g feature prominently in all expressions above, extension of this sort will influence optimal decision making as well as the responsiveness of optimal decision making to changes in other policies and parameters.7 One such parameter that deserves particular attention is misperceptions regarding weather volatility. In particular, it is possible that extension could make targeted efforts to help farmers better understand weather and help them update their heuristics under a changing climate. This is, in fact, one of the risk management interventions we will examine via simulation in later sections."

35,275,0.319,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"How attitudes to aquaculture vary and correspond between social groups must be taken into account by planning authorities. However, capturing these varying stakeholder attitudes are also of relevance for businesses, NGOs and other stakeholders (Mazur and Curtis 2008; Freeman et al. 2012; Ladenburg and Krause 2011). Studies from different countries have explored groupsâ views on how aquaculture impacts, i.e. on the environment (e.g. by chemical pollution, effecting local ï¬sh stocks and wildlife, visual pollution of coastal landscape), on possible job-creation and economic beneï¬ts of mostly rural marginal areas, how it interferes with tourism, ï¬shing or recreation, how it contributes to food security, and how the regulation of aquaculture should be. This has been done for a number of countries, including Australia (Mazur and Curtis 2006, 2008), Spain (Bacher et al. 2014), Thailand (Schmitt and Brugere 2013), US and Norway (Chu et al. 2010), Greece (Katranidis et al. 2003), New Zealand (Shafer et al. 2010), Germany (Krause et al. 2011; Wever et al. 2015), Israel (Freeman et al. 2012), and Scotland (Whitmarsh and Palmieri 2009). Many of the studies concentrate on local stakeholder groups related to aquaculture (e.g. Bacher et al. 2014), several include tourists (e.g. Katranidis et al. 2003), some consider the general public (e.g. Mazur and Curtis 2008), and some also try to consider how the attitudes and risk perceptions expressed correlate with personal characteristics (e.g. lifestyle behaviour, Freeman et al. 2012), or even with community situation (e.g. employment or income deprivation, Whitmarsh and Palmieri 2009). Bergfjord (2009) asked ï¬sh farmers in Norway what they see as the greatest risks to their business. The majority of respondents raised biggest concerns pertaining to market conditions for their product and towards the outbreak of diseases. Socially related dimensions do, however, also appear on their list, including sea area access, changes to the license system and of environmental regulations, which are all relatively high up on the list, while public repugnance to ï¬sh farms (aesthetics, environment) is ranked lower. Slater et al. (2013), investigate how personal characteristics correlate with willingness towards choosing aquaculture as a livelihood in a developing country setting. Their model allows policy makers to consider the influence of socio-economic factors on the success of introducing aquaculture in different local contexts."
302,207,0.318,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The question then becomes, not if MPs are present, but where and how to sample them. The marine and estuarine research conducted in South Africa provides a potential guide via beach combing, water and sediment collection, and biological sampling. However, such efforts may be difficult in the absence of personnel, apparatus, and, of course, funding. Thus, the study of Biginagwa et al. [16], exemplified in Case Study II, in which MPs were extracted and identified from suitable biological indicators that inhabit the urbanized catchment area is offered as a model for research in other areas that can be conducted in a cost- and timeeffective manner. The confirmation of MPs is only the first step, albeit necessary for further understanding of sources and fate. Mitigating the effects of MPs requires the coming together of numerous interested stakeholders, not least the local populations. In the place where our species first evolved, it now falls on the current generation to preserve Africaâs freshwaters for the future."

Faced with radical herd losses, thousands of Turkana households have moved to Lake Turkanaâs western shoreline for ï¬shing and/or herding. This populationâlargely uncountedâis extremely vulnerable to loss of accessible Lake Turkana water, ï¬sheries resources, and lakeside grazing. The Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural plantations along the Omo would cause major shoreline retreat and eliminate the Omo Riverâs annual flood âpulseâ of fresh-water and nutrients into the lake. Major loss of ï¬sh reproductive habitat and ï¬sh stocks as well as potable water, along with desiccation of lakeside environments essential to livestock and people would result. As conditions worsen, a general movement of ï¬shing and ï¬shing/pastoral villages southward toward Fergusonâs Gulfâitself drying outâand around towns, in search of relief aid or survival opportunities, is likely. With no practical means of continued livelihood, hundreds of thousands of Turkana ï¬shers and pastoralists would face region wide hunger and conditions for disease epidemics. Cross-border conflict between these Turkana and their northern neighbors would sharply escalate, especially in the face of regional arms trafï¬cking. Northern and central Turkana protests and pleas for help have so far been ignored by the Kenyan government which continues to militarize the region."
198,498,0.318,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"The TAMD framework is for use in many contexts and at many scales to assess and compare the effectiveness of interventions that directly or indirectly assist populations in adapting to climate change. It also provides an explicit framework for two tracks; Track 1 entails assessing the capacity of institutions to undertake effective climate risk management (CRM) actions (also called top-down), while Track 2 entails assessing impacts of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability and the extent to which such interventions keep development on track (development performance or bottom-up) â Fig. 15.1. The TAMD operational framework8 has a set of eight commonly used indicators that can be used to measure top down/climate risk management processes being implemented by government institutions using a score card (these indicators are further described under the top-down process â Track 1). The operational framework then suggests that theories of change (ToCs) be used to measure the change pathways from adaptation interventions to development performance in bottom up processes (Track 2). It further suggests that linkages between climate risk management processes and development performance/adaptive capacity can be shown in a ToC. Thus the development of ToCs can be within one track or between tracks. The researchers therefore chose to measure top bottom processes with a score card and ToCs to show changes in adaptive capacity using bottom up approaches. In addition the researchers used a ToC to make the linkage between Tracks 1 and 2."
147,179,0.318,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"Therefore, the more individualsâ physical and psychological health are endangered, the stronger their motivation will be to act on potential sustainable development opportunities to overcome these threats. That is, these types of threats (and potential opportunities) are more likely to lead to negative emotions that prompt the search for a solution (Mathews & MacLeod, 1994). After recognizing the threat and overcoming their primary fear response, motivated individuals methodically pursue opportunities to escape or overcome this threat (Beck & Clark, 1997). During this âelaborative strategic processing of [the] threat,â individuals manage information slowly in an effortful and schema-driven way, but then a âsecondary appraisal process occurs in which anxious individuals evaluate the availability and effectiveness of their coping resources to deal with the perceived threatâ (Beck & Clark, 1997, p. 53). This discussion leads to several interesting questions: How do individuals whose physical and psychological health is threatened by the decline of the natural or communal environment evaluate opportunities to escape that threat? To what extent do these threatened individuals use information (i.e., knowledge) about the natural/communal environment and their entrepreneurial knowledge to create or recognize potential sustainable entrepreneurship opportunities? In addition to the negative emotions arising from feelings of personal threat, altruism can also result in emotions that direct attention to potential sustainable development opportunities. This altruistic motivation occurs when people empathize with or sympathize for underprivileged others (Batson, 1991; Davis, 1996). Empathetic individuals are able to take the perspective of disadvantaged others and personally experience similar emotions to those in need (Eisenberg, 2000). For example, people who empathize with individuals in poverty-stricken societies are able to experience (at least partially) their disadvantaged counterpartsâ burdens in providing for their children. The higher individualsâ empathy is for others, the more motivated they become to identify and act upon potential opportunities that counter these othersâ negative emotional experiences and sorrows because these feelings are partly their own. That is, highly empathetic individuals are driven to pursue sustainable development opportunities that transform disadvantaged peopleâs situation because by doing so, they can also improve their own emotional state. In contrast to those who are more empathetic, sympathetic individuals are able to think and feel themselves into disadvantaged othersâ position, but they have different emotions than those actually going through the"

Nevertheless, the outbreak of Hendra increased the unpopularity of flying foxes in Australia, making conservation of the four native species challenging (Thiriet 2011). Unlike Hendra, Nipah virus has likely been acquired by humans via consumption of contaminated date palm sap (Luby et al. 2006; Rahman et al. 2012), followed by person-to-person transmission (Gurley et al. 2007). Although diseases associated with Hendra virus and Nipah virus have high mortality rates, the risk of infection for humans seems to be low (Chong et al. 2003), and countermeasures may be taken in order to prevent future spillover events (see Sect. 10.5.2). MERS, just as Hendra virus, apparently needs livestock as an amplifier host. In contrast to dromedaries (Hemida et al. 2014), seroprevalence of MERS seems to be low in bats (Memish et al. 2013), making direct transmission from bats to humans unlikely. As long as details on MERS infections in dromedaries and how to mitigate them are missing, it is hard to give recommendations to people who might be at risk. In contrast to MERS, the spillover of SARS into the human populations most likely happened via the wildlife market, either directly from a bat, or from other wildlife species. Likewise, the hunting, butchering and consumption of chimpanzees, gorillas and bats seem to have been sources of Ebola spillovers from wildlife to humans. The education of local communities needs to carefully balance information about the potential risk of acquiring infectious diseases by consuming bushmeat, without implying that bats need to be eradicated in order to prevent spillovers. The recent outbreak of Ebola resulting in several thousand human victims, and with bats frequently being reported as the likely source of origin, has undoubtly led to severe loss of reputation of bats on this continent, which makes the conservation of threatened populations and species even more challenging, not only in Africa, but also worldwide."

However, the extent to which this occurs depends on the ability to attract financial capital to areas most suited to expansion. It is quite likely that better managed, informed and more agile players, big or small, will be the ones that take advantage of these new opportunities. Moreover, climate change may exacerbate differences between agile and nonagile actors. One of the main unintended consequences of climate change is an increasing of the gap between more traditional and less mobile farming communities with more entrepreneurial, mobile groups. This means that policies that assist in relocation and provide access to new opportunities may help overcome some of the negative distributional effects of adaptation to climate change. Similarly, climate change may cause migration of farm workers from areas that suffer from worsening conditions. Migration is a difficult process and one may expect to see the emergence of networks of labor contractors that will enable movement of labor across regions. These types of labor movements are sometimes associated with illicit activities and human rights violations, and thus may require regulation and policy interventions, but the migration itself may provide better outcomes for people who live in regions that suffer from climate change. Finally, one of the important challenges of public research is to develop and disseminate technologies that will slow the impacts of migrating weather. Even relatively small changes in temperature may have significant impact that require adaptation (Di Falco and Veronesi 2014). Moreover, slightly higher temperatures may increase vulnerability to pests and reduces chill days, which are required for blooming of some tree crops. Addressing these changes may require significant science-based adaptation. This may include new varieties better suited to changing agro-climatic conditions as well as practices to decrease the negative side effects of warming that may include new pests and shorter tree bloom. While government in developed countries may engage in supporting this type of research and development, in some developing countries the private sector may be engaged in pursuing appropriate technologies to assure availability of inputs. For example, multinationals which depend on the production of cacao, rubber, and other tropical crops, may engage in enhancing the capacity of producers to withstand the impacts of a changing climate. At the same time, these organizations may also encourage investment in production of these crops in new regions."

Therefore, governance related to market conditions, job opportunities and access to resources and markets has a critical impact on the future welfare of the study area. However, a word of caution needs to be raised: even though the economy and well-being of the population can increase under appropriate governance and social policies, environmental change can still have a detrimental effect on the food security for Bangladesh. For example, soil salinity, together with household socioeconomic characteristics, is one of the main explanatory variables of food security for coastal households (negative effect) regardless of wealth levels (Szabo et al. 2015). In the modelling discussed here, soil salinisation is likely to continue and even accelerate after 2050 due to sea-level rise and subsidence. Furthermore, increasing future cyclone frequency and magnitude together with increasing sea-level rise can be catastrophic for agriculture and, through damage, can impact all sectors in the coastal zone. Therefore, appropriate adaptation will be required to sustain an ecosystem service rich coastal zone and food-secure coastal population. This might include some combination of enhanced polders, tidal river management, water diversions and nature-based approaches. Such adaptation requires additional assessment."

A central perspective provided with this volume is that the costs of inaction on land degradation are much higher than that of the costs of taking action against degradation. The joint research teams at Center for Development Research (ZEF) and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) are grateful for the many partnerships we were able to build around this topic, which is so fundamental for sustainable development. The research presented in this book is the outcome of collaborative efforts by numerous individuals and institutions. Up front we thank them all, although inadvertently not all may have been mentioned here. This book would not have been possible without the time and efforts of thousands of households who participated in the surveys and community focus group discussions contributing to the individual case studies and sharing their knowledge and experiences for addressing land degradation. Each of the studies beneï¬ted from the advice of external reviewers, individual researchers, and development and policy practitioners. We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to Professor Rattan Lal for serving as the leading external reviewer of this volume and for sharing his tremendous experience and advice with us throughout the background research for this volume. We are also highly indebted to Zhanguo Bai, Edward Barbier, Rashid Hassan, Jane Kabubo-Mariara, Tobias Landmann, Erik Nelson, Martin Petrick, and Paul Reich for their highly insightful comments and suggestions during the review of individual studies. The interim results of the chapters were presented in several workshops and conferences, including the Global Soil Weeks in Berlin, where they received valuable comments"

197,39,0.318,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"energy transItIons Processes of structural change in the energy sectorâoften called âenergy transitionsââhave also been known to increase inequality and deprivation; they are hence of key relevance to understandings of energy poverty (Bouzarovski et al., 2017; Bridge et al., 2013). Even though the term âenergy transitionsâ implies a shift towards a socially desirable end state, there is no consensus among practitioners or academics as to the exact shape of this future as far as the ongoing process of decarbonization is concerned. While such debates have often taken place under the conceptual umbrella of âsustainability transitionsâ (Frantzeskaki, Loorbach, & Meadowcroft, 2012; Lawhon & Murphy, 2012), the multilayered social and technical nature of energy provision means that low-carbon policies inherently involve a complex interplay of political interests, institutional forces and governance practices. The suggestion that the long-term transformation of energy systems will prove âto be a messy, conflictual, and highly disjointed processâ (Meadowcroft, 2009, p. 323) destabilizes the notion that what is at stake is a linear movement towards a predefined environmentally sustainable condition. Moreover, even if a certain set of technical requirements is achieved, there may be no underlying change to the regulatory practices that surround energy use: the same type of infrastructural outcome can be achieved via different policy means, and without altering the basic principles of system organization (Bridge et al., 2013). The new âenergy paradigmâ (Helm, 2005), therefore, opens fundamental questions about the manner in which different political interests and social formations interact with technological change. Some of these dilemmas have included the role of the state in exercising different governing capacities in steering socio-technical transitions (Baker, Newell, & Phillips, 2014), the ability of âcommunity-based initiativesâ to generate innovation (Seyfang & Haxeltine, 2012), the manner in which intermediary organizations assist the implementation of low-carbon strategies (Marvin, 2012) as well as the historical forces involved in shaping deep-seated structural shifts in systems of provision (Smil, 2003). Historically, energy transitions have been associated with far-reaching shifts in the underpinnings of resource production and distribution, as well as their associated economic and human development patterns. It is claimed that the adoption of low-carbon technology solutions and mitigation strategies brings about multiple benefits in the form of enhanced"

36,788,0.318,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"background, its history, or its problems and its future. In part as a result, taxonomists are typically under-represented in official or unofficial bodies that play significant roles in shaping scientific policies, budgets, and definition of priorities. Yet, taxonomists are critically needed for research in understudied groups, such as bats, especially in developing countries. Without any formalized society, it becomes difficult to pass on the expertise and shared standards that are essential to all other fields in biology, including conservation. The reduction in numbers of taxonomists in institutions in developed countries and the increase seen in developing countries is complicated by a great deal of historical baggage. Type specimens (the actual specimens to which scientific names are attached) and important taxonomic literature are still based in institutions in developed countries, and there is still an imperative need for repatriation of information as well as capacity building outside these centers. Capacity building can occur at three different levels: individual (build individual ability to contribute to taxonomy), institutional (modernize museum infrastructure and policies, increase the level of curatorial proficiency in staff), and societal (engage the public in understanding and learning about biodiversity and being held accountable for it). Lack of access to available information is then also a part of the taxonomic impediment to conservation, not just lack of research in the discipline. Progress has been made recently to increase accessibility of resources housed in institutions in developed countries. Digitization of type specimens of bats by some of the larger museums (e.g., American Museum of Natural History), increased availability of literature through online sources, increased training in developing countries, and increased collaborations between Western taxonomists with young taxonomists from developing countries have begun to counter gaps in knowledge and training. Collections research fellowships are now available at some institutions to provide researchers with funds needed for visiting museums and inspecting specimens first-hand. Developing countries now see an increase in new bat taxa described in international, open-access journals by in-country scientists. New, well-maintained, and actively used natural history collections now exist in places like the University of Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Prince of Songkla University, Thailand; and the National University of Laos, thanks to local support and funding by NGOs such as the Darwin Initiative, the Systematics Association, and the MacArthur Foundation. Older collections in species-rich tropical countries, such as at the National Museum of the Philippines, the Museo de ZoologÃ­aMamÃ­feros, Pontifica Universidad CatÃ³lica del Ecuador, and the Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, have refurbished outdated collections spaces and benefited from increased access to information and increased local capacity as talented local scientists have helped reignite interest in conservation and biodiversity initiatives. Museum collections and historic taxonomic descriptions themselves may, counterintuitively, present impediments to taxonomic research. While todayâs taxonomists use morphological and genetic data (when available) to establish species limits, such modern methods have only come to the fore recently. Many older species names are attached to poorly preserved type specimens, sometimes dry"

Some authors suggest, however, that the intended use of the information collected from such activities by the military would exempt this category from the MSR regime.65 On the contrary, others argue that military surveys cannot be distinguished from MSR as the respective motives cannot be easily determined.66 They seem to suggest that all marine data collection activities should be covered by the MSR regime; otherwise, they could be carried out in the coastal Statesâ EEZ without any restrictions. Another important activity, of which the inclusion in the MSR regime is hotly debated, is bioprospecting.67 It relates to the access to genetic resources and involves collection and analysis of information, data, or samples aimed at increasing humankindâs knowledge of the valuable compounds and genetic materials. The possible commercialization of the results would have âthe practical effect of transforming the activity into one that is of direct significance to the exploitation of a natural resource.â68 It seems that, as in the case of military surveys, it is the intended use of the data collected from such activities, rather than the practical nature of the activities themselves, that distinguishes them from pure scientific research. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer for all these concerns as there is no definition of MSR activities and the means of their execution."

222,89,0.317,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Assets, income, nutrition- and blood pressure-related health indicators and subjective well-being vary with location. Waterlogging, high salinity and access are significantly associated with poverty in the study area with different spatial patterns apparent for these three variables (see Chap. 21 and Amoako Johnson et al. 2016). Soil salinity is significantly associated with poverty around the Sundarbans, waterlogging in the centre of the study area, while the lack of access dominates in the east of the study area. For example, the factors associated with asset poverty vary across the study area. Considering all social-ecological systems, the probability of being materially and subjectively poor decreases as household dependence on ecosystem services for income increases. However, the irrigated agricultural zone showed the opposite relationship, with increasing dependence on ecosystem services being associated with a higher probability of being materially poor. Similar spatial and social-ecological system-based differences are found in the health indicators (Chap. 27) and in how individuals perceive their own well-being. Levels of malnourishment are higher than the national average but vary across the study area. For example, food consumption varies across the study area and by social-ecological system. Irrigated agriculture areas show the lowest protein intake and one of the lowest calorie intakes. In comparison, households living in the char and rain-fed agricultural social-ecological systems also have low calorie intake levels, but the protein consumption (from fish) is much higher and child undernutrition lower. This indicates that fish consumption appears crucial to health in some social-ecological system."
309,41,0.317,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"Part IIIâThe Politics of Food Security Part III touches on the most basic anxiety around food: food securityâ namely the adequate availability and accessibility of food not only to meaningfully fuel oneâs body but to avoid malnutrition and chronic hunger. At the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome, food security was defined as âexist[ing] when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy lifeâ (FAO 1996). Critical debates on food security often take a swipe at the conceptâs apolitical core and its technocratic understanding of âfeeding the worldâ from the topdown (Holt GimÃ©nez and Shattuck 2011). The genuine political nature of food safety, however, comes into light when relating it more closely to the path-dependency of colonial exploitation, the unequal conditions of global trade, and mass production and mass consumerism bearing most severely on marginalised groups to cater for their food needs. The political dimension of food security also plays in as much as food provision and accessibility are crucial in terms of national sovereignty and political authority, providing the essential backbone for a regimeâs legitimacy (Bohstedt 2016). Part III of this book centres on such political dimensions of food security when it discusses questions of national sovereignty and the limits of protecting domestic production markets amidst global food provisioning systems. The chapters in this book part portray how, despite the general abundance of food on a global scale and increase in consumer affluence, structural deficiencies of the agri-food system continue to work to the"
364,358,0.317,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"A total of 175 adult members of the public were given a questionnaire about the risks posed by the construction industry. This survey revealed that the majority were very much aware of the various risks faced by people, plants, and animals, as well as the risks to the environment as a result of construction activities. For example, most of them agreed that construction activity can cause soil erosion, floods, loss of natural resources, reduction in soil quality, and reduction of rain absorption area. The majority also recognized that loss of habitat, death, and destruction are some of the effects on plants and animals. Similarly, most of them agreed that animals may move away from an area where construction takes place. In addition, a large number of respondents also acknowledged that two risks faced by humans are health problems due to dust released during construction and feeling discomfort due to the noise from construction. However, only around one third of the sample considered that murky water caused by soil erosion from construction sites could have a negative effect on fish in rivers. In general, most of the people surveyed held similar perceptions about construction risks irrespective of their academic or social background. One notable exception, however, was educational level: Among the sample who responded to this survey, those who had completed university education obtained a mean score of 63.09 for construction risk awareness. Those who were educated up to pre-university level, on the other hand, obtained a corresponding mean score of 59.68. This difference is statistically significant as shown by the p value of .01 in the independent samples t-test analysis conducted. This implies that university education helped improve awareness of construction risk."
118,641,0.317,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Observing that Three Mile Island occurred in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011, could lead to a pessimistic conclusion that there is risk of a severe nuclear accident nearly every generation. Were another accident to occur in the future, it is the third generation that will be at the forefront of ensuing response. Technical communication with the public in terms of risk management would be an imperative then as it is now. A dialogue addressing the nuclear engineer as a professional, and responsibilities therein, beginning now, could, optimistically, avoid the public problems associated with accidents. Lacking an awareness of the professional concept is a disservice to the public-at-large, and this must be addressed."
87,771,0.317,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","Since rich countries are unlikely to renounce their wealth, closing the prosperity gap will be accompanied by an increasing demand for food, feed, products, and energy. It is expected, however, that in the longer run, increasing demand will not be satisfied by the available supply of metals, minerals, and fossil fuels. Recycling strategies can reduce the pressure on primary resources, but even with technological progress, excess demand for non-renewable materials will not be sufficiently lowered. Climate change and increasing pressure on the natural environment demand a change in strategy. For this reason, the European Commission, among others, proposes a radical change in âits approach production, consumption, processing, storage, recycling and disposal of biological resourcesâ (European Commission 2012). This bioeconomic strategy needs to: â¢ Ensure food security. â¢ Manage natural resources."
341,394,0.317,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Abstract This chapter explores the likely trends and outcomes in water governance by about 2030 in two regions: South Asia and Southern Africa. It addresses the question: What are the prospects for developing governance arrangements in the two regions that will lead to more positive outcomes in terms of sustainably improving peopleâs livelihoods while conserving natural resources? It examines this question through three âlensesâ: (1) âbeyond disciplinesâ, (2) âbeyond scalesâ and (3) âbeyond âinstitutionalâ hardware to âhumanâ softwareâ. The two regions are currently on different trajectories: the Southern African trajectory seems to be moving in a positive direction, in contrast with South Asia. The chapter discusses four factors that go far to explaining this divergence: (1) the contrasting roles of the hegemonic countries, (2) the level of intercountry âtrustâ that has emerged in the two regions, (3) the roles of civil society and NGOs and (4) the roles of external facilitators. The chapter emphasises the importance of developing the human software â the âsoft skillsâ of communication and shared values complementing technical competence â as the most critical driver of successful water resource governance."
35,277,0.317,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"The omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has, more often than not, contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Krause et al. 2015). Therefore, the analysis and documentation of who the relevant stakeholder groups are is important for achieving a good planning process. This may include assessment of their legitimacy and power (Buanes et al. 2004). The design and execution of the planning process for aquaculture, or for the broader MSP process, is important both for the efï¬ciency of the process and for the social sustainability of the outcomes. Qualities like transparency, representativeness and fairness matter for i.e. the legitimacy and support for the outcome (Buanes et al. 2004), for the wider trust in authorities, for development/maintenance of democracy, and for sustainable development (Krause et al. 2015). Who to include in the planning process, and how, can be difï¬cult to decide upon, balancing the ideals above with the ambition for an effective planning process, which typically also is embedded in a larger governance system. Whilst addressing the interactions and feedbacks between issues (e.g. economic, social and environmental consequences) in a MSP context, it becomes evident that many of these play out over time (i.e. in past, present and future contexts) and space (i.e. at local, regional and ecosystem/global scale)âthese are referred to as âcross-scaleâ or âmulti-scaleâ processes (Krause et al. 2015). What time-scale to consider in the planning process, and thus also what geographical scale, is also something that must be decided. Discussions of the availability, usefulness and ease of use of knowledge is also important, e.g. on aquacultureâs value creation and its distribution (Isaksen and Mikkelsen 2012). For example, with the development of feed-aquaculture turning to more land-based production of feeds, agriculture can also be seen as a new emerging stakeholder in aquaculture production (Costa-Pierce 2010). Indeed, when new groups of stakeholders are included in planning processes they may often bring"

302,175,0.317,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"As the birthplace of our species, the African continent holds a unique place in human history. Current scientific consensus places the evolution of modern humans in East Africa approximately 200,000 years ago from where they successfully dispersed approximately 72,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene [1, 2]. From here our species continued to spread and over the next 50,000 years or so colonized the majority of the Earthâs land surface. Fast-forward through the following epoch, the Holocene, which is regarded as being relatively stable in terms of climate, and we arrive at a point in time in which humankind have established themselves as the dominant force and major driver for environmental change. Accordingly a new era is said to have now dawned â the Anthropocene [3, 4]. While the exact start date of the Anthropocene is subject to much current debate, the advent of the industrial age (ca. 1800s) changed the dynamics between humans and the environment. The Anthropocene is thus defined by human actions which perturb the Earthâs land, oceans, and biosphere [5]. These dramatic effects include climate change, ocean acidification, deforestation, and plastic pollution. Plastics (and microplastics, MPs, defined as <5 mm in size) are considered a hallmark of this new anthropogenic age, having become widely used in the last 60 years [6], and are now a ubiquitous pollutant found worldwide and in all aquatic compartments (surface waters, water column, and sediments) and numerous animals (invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and marine mammals) [7]. Up until recently MP pollution had been viewed solely as a marine issue, but there is now an increasing amount of information regarding the presence of MPs in freshwaters [8, 9]. MPs have been sampled from both freshwater lakes, such as Lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior in Canada [10], Lake Geneva in Switzerland [11], and Lake Garda in Italy [12], and rivers, such as the River Thames in London (UK, [13]), River Seine in Paris (France, [14]), and the Danube [15], to name but a few. In this last study, the mass and abundance of drifting plastic items in the Austrian Danube were found to be higher than those of larval fish [15], which is an indication of the magnitude of the problem. However, there is remarkably little information on the presence of MPs in the freshwaters of Africa â the place where it all started for humans! In this chapter we begin by outlining the scope for plastic pollution in African inland waters, both through the nature of the water bodies and the human pressures"
378,83,0.317,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"thinking, feeling, and acting. SETSâs are created, ordered and stabilized through human decision-making and (often) conscious creation of regime structures. Searching for more efï¬cient technologies and more effective economic incentives is not enough when looking for sustainability solutions. It is the institutional setups and sociocultural frameworks that deï¬ne the purpose for which technologies and economic instruments are used. Here is where we ï¬nd the root causes of trends. Incentives and technologies mostly function as accelerating or balancing feedback, but not in themselves as game changers. This is why the multi-phase concept as I posit it here gives the sociocultural anchoring of alternative proposals and pioneering solutions a crucial role in all phases of transformation. In the amended MLP it is the purple and blue arrows that make the link. They indicate how mind-sets mediate between agents and structures and how the dominant paradigm functions as a reference framework for justiï¬cations and narratives of change. The big arrow on the right hand side of the graph also shows, however, that each individual is constantly involved in shaping the future paradigm. By providing reason, opinions, arguments and experiences as well as non-verbal reactions and behavior we can all participate in paradigm shifts and thus in changing reality. Polanyi demonstrated this link in his account of the Great Transformation. The classical economic paradigm played a crucial role in making todayâs default solution the growth-ï¬xated development path. This paradigm survived over two centuries of criticism by amending itself into a neoclassical version. But today its basic assumptions are challenged from so many angles and the institutional solutions and processes based on it deliver so many crises that the time is ripe to shift from diversiï¬ed irritation to unifying consolidation: which insights on human needs and natural resource reproduction in todayâs scientiï¬c debates could become the foundational ideas of a new development paradigm?

The value of MTBD can be assessed more precisely by geologically-based study. Price elasticity, which determines the resourcefulness of the system, will be lowered aggressive introduction of emergency power source although cost-effectiveness of their installation should be considered, of course. Assessment on these policies through energy model analysis will give the potential contributions and beneï¬ts of them. Concerning scenarios planning and model reï¬nement, the design of systems has a key role. Social activities in todayâs world are supported by highly complex and interdependent system, and so, risks surrounding us are very systemic. Fukushima nuclear power plant accident is such a kind of risk. Therefore, targeted system should be comprehensive enough to consider their inter-relations although the system considered in this paper is limited within electricity supply system. In addition, more kinds of risks should be considered because our challenges to be dealt with now in this world are not only nuclear usage. Finally, to address above requirements, the most important seems to learn effectively from accidents and update our social scientiï¬c knowledge base. The implement of what we have learned into energy model makes it more sophisticated and the model will tell us how to design resilient systems.

The use of these media can be very demanding for some, who âin their worldsâ apply different media or media in a different way. Due to the diversity of viewpoints and ways to use media, there is a considerable chance that communication might fail. Project participants may not understand each other and get frustrated or conflicts may evolve. This interpretation of a transdisciplinary project gives some hints, what kind of issues should be addressed and how results should look like. Firstly, the group has to acknowledge and accept the differences. The process is about understanding the diversity of viewpoints, knowledges, languages and motivations. After the project, everybody will return to his or her own world and must live with the outcomes. Thus, solutions must be designed in ways that they create connectivity between formerly separated worlds, without changing (too much) the worlds (business people will continue to seek for profit, academics for higher reputation and policymakers for voters) (cf. Sect. 4.4). Summarising, it can be concluded that systems theory is a powerful and extremely productive conceptual approach in the sense that it set manifold impulses for the creation of linkages and the integration of knowledge among various disciplines and groups of professional actors.

10,42,0.316,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"2012 (European CommissionâDG ENV 2012). In 2008, the European Parliament adopted a report on the Communication, calling for a number of initiatives at the EU level. It also requested the Commission to initiate pilot projects in areas of key interest (European CommissionâDG ENV 2012).1 In January 2008, MEPs and experts convened at the European Parliamentâs Climate Change Temporary Committeeâs Fourth Thematic Session to discuss the complex links between water issues and climate change. The session determined that signiï¬cant decisions regarding the best way forward with climate adaptation strategies was a top priority. Speciï¬cally, the discussion focused on the need for water policies to respond to the impacts of climate and changing agricultural demands, calling policy development to move beyond water policy itself to be more encompassing (Farmer et al. 2008). The former European Parliament Environment Commissioner PotoÄnik was a key leader in mobilisations efforts following the session. At a hearing in January 2010, he announced a new focus area on resource efï¬ciency, including water efï¬ciency, for the upcoming mandate. He also unveiled a new Commission initiative entitled âBlueprint for safeguarding European Waters,â slated for release in 2012. The Blueprint aimed to review the WFD, including the successes and challenges of its implementation, as well as provide insight on water and resource vulnerabilities in the face the climate change and other man-made pressure (European CommissionâDG ENV 2012). The European Commission Joint Research Centre also helped to establish the European Drought Observatory (EDO) as part of ongoing efforts to integrate drought into policy. Since 2011, the EDO has been the leading disseminator on drought-relevant information and maps of indicators derived from a range of different data sources, including precipitation measurements, satellite measurements and modelled soil moisture content (Vogt et al. 2011). At its core, the EDO serves to buttress the already existing Global Drought Information System, with a focus on the European context. Like its sister initiative, the EDO provides a technical approach to drought policy and integrates ârelevant data and research results, drought monitoring, detection and forecasting on different spatial scales, from local and regional activities to a continental overview at EU level (Vogt 2011)â in order to aid evaluation and decision-making of future water scarcity and drought events (Vogt et al. 2011). The EDO is also responsible for severe drought events, and produces reports detailing the situation to better inform policymakers (European CommissionâJRC 2015). In addition, the EDO is also responsible for retrieving information on droughts and related topics from global news portals using the European Media Monitor tool (Council of the European Communities 1979)."

Sibanda takes this further citing the cases of subsidized weather-based index insurance in Uganda, Zambia and Swaziland conducted by FANRPAN last year. The results of that study indicate the potential for weather based insurance, but also some key factors to ensure its success, including the importance of organizing farmers into groups. Subsidizing the insurance is an important way of getting people into a new way of doing things. It is key to build the human capacity needed for effective management of such schemes: by training local insurers on the businesses of insurance in agriculture and at the same time helping people to understand what it means to keep records, subscribe as a group, and work through group ownership. She says: What is exciting is that through insurance youâre now creating a business of a bankable industry whereby youâre introducing services that would actually escalate beyond primary entry point which is agriculture."

391,139,0.316,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"1.2.3.2 CLAW Hypothesis Charlson et al. (1987) proposed a potential link between DMS emission from the oceans and production of new aerosol particles (see chapter 4 for a discussion of marine aerosols), resulting in changes in cloud albedo which could influence the temperature in the surface ocean and/or the amount of UV that reaches the ocean. This could, in turn, influence the production of DMS and hence its flux to the atmosphere. In their original paper, they mentioned that the sign of the impact of changes in cloud albedo was uncertain, but a decrease of oceanic DMS production following an increase in cloud albedo would constitute a negative feedback, i.e. a climate stabilising mechanism. This idea is usually referred to as the CLAW hypothesis (using the first letter of the authorsâ names, see Fig. 1.4) and has triggered much research since it was first published a quarter of a century ago (Charlson et al. 1987), especially in the field of ocean biogeochemistry and atmospheric particle formation. However, the fact that the hypothesis involves biological, chemical and physical interactions in the ocean and atmosphere over varying time and space scales makes it arguably untestable as a whole. Socalled Earth System models that aim to include all components of the earth system (ocean and atmospheric physics and chemistry as well as ocean biogeochemistry) might, in principle, be able to test the CLAW hypothesis. However, many feedbacks are not well understood and are probably non-linear, hence their replication in a global model will be imperfect. Earth System models have shown inconclusive results, some predicting slight increases and others slight decreases in DMS fluxes for future climate simulations (e.g. Bopp et al. 2003; Gabric et al. 2001, 2004; Kloster et al. 2007; Vallina et al. 2007; Cameron-Smith et al. 2011). All studies found large regional differences, so a climate feedback â if present â may not be acting globally. Our limited knowledge of the strong interactions between physics, biogeochemistry and DMS make quantitative modeling of the whole system very challenging. A crucial link for the CLAW hypothesis to act as a climate stabilising feedback is that an increase"

Propagule pressure is also important. Christen and Matlack (2006) suggested that undisturbed areas are generally less invaded precisely because they may receive fewer non-native propagules. Avoiding the introduction of non-native propagules prevents not only the establishment of invasive species, but also offers much greater economic beneï¬ts than the management of invasive populations after their establishment (Keller et al. 2007). Equally important, management options available prior to invasion are more numerous and include legislation or quarantine rules (Keller et al. 2011; Buckley and Catford 2016). In this context, the inspection of cargo and their containers is of great importance, particularly for those having an international origin. For example, a recent inspection of international cargo entering the USA by rail enabled the identiï¬cation of dozens of undeclared organisms, among which were invasive insects, noxious weeds and vectors of human diseases (https://goo.gl/fJ1uMo). Following legal rulings, some of the inspected cargo was re-exported to its origin in order to prevent the dispersal of the unwanted pests. In many cases, however, prevention is not possible as the non-native species are already established in the landscape. In such cases, management actions should aim at containing or eradicating these species. However, the broad range of invasive species and the different ways that humans value the colonized ecosystems mean that few generalizations can be provided for management and policy guidelines. In other words, appropriate management and policies for invasive species is highly context dependent (Keller et al. 2011). However, based on the review provided by Catford et al. (2012), one can consider four not mutually exclusive main approaches for managing transportation corridor verges when attempting to control or eradicate invasive species: (1) âDo nothing;â (2) âControl at the introduction level by managing the propagule supply of non-native and native species;â (3) âManage environmental conditions;â and (4) âManage invasive species populations.â 1. Do nothing. This is an option when invaders are well established and are successional colonists. Several studies have shown that the proportion of invasive species can decrease with time since disturbanceânot only weedy plants (Bellingham et al. 2005), but also larger plants (Dewine and Cooper 2008). Hence, active management by removal of invasive species immediately following disturbance may be unnecessary and counterproductive. For example, tamarisk species (Tamarix ramosissima, T. chinensis, T. gallica and hybrids) have invaded riparian zones throughout western North America, southern Africa, Argentina, Hawaii, and Australia, demanding expensive control efforts. However, as a relatively recent addition to North American plant communities (the 1920sâ1960s was the period of main invasion), the competitive and successional processes are still ongoing. In fact, Dewine and Cooper (2008) demonstrated that box elder (Acer negundo), a native species found in canyons throughout western North America, is a superior competitor to tamarisk and is capable of becoming established under dense tamarisk canopies, overtopping and eventually killing the tamarisks. Thus, superior shade tolerance appears to"

366,201,0.316,"The Future of the Law of the Sea : Bridging Gaps Between National, Individual and Common Interests","1 Introduction Since the Challenger expedition in the 1870s, which is considered as the advent of modern oceanography,1 marine scientific research (hereafter MSR) has considerably evolved. New methods of research covering a wide area of scientific interest such as biology, chemistry, geology, and geophysics, as well as advanced technology stemming from simple techniques (dredging, sediment coring, towing of platforms carrying video recorders, and echo sounding traverses) to very sophisticated and extremely expensive ones (such as remotely operated vehicles, known as ROVs, capable of diving to great depths to carry out research and retrieve samples from the deep sea) have been put forward in order to enhance our knowledge on the marine environment.2 This scientific (r)evolution has inevitably increased the interest of the coastal States in the potential economic exploitation of their offshore resources and has consequently grown their appetite for further expanding their jurisdiction in the oceans. While scientific understanding of the role of the oceans has considerably progressed since the nineteenth century, we still know very little of this huge, abyssal, and often inaccessible, natural asset. Although oceans represent a very"

In practice, in any particular situation there will inevitably be stronger emphases on some levels or aspects. Historically, many people considered âbiodiversityâ to consist only of composition, at the species level. Be guided primarily by what the users of the information need, secondly by what is observable using the available technology, and only then by what happened to have been collected in the past.

38,542,0.316,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"there were no invasion indicators that had been developed for reporting at a global scale (Genovesi et al. 2013). There were many sources of information, but no collated body of data with global coverage on which species were where, and what impact they were having, particularly not for a range of taxonomic groups (McGeoch et al. 2012). Apart from many local case studies and a few regional ones (notably for Europe) there were also very few data on changes in the numbers of species threatening biodiversity over time. The solution was to tackle the problem from three angles (McGeoch et al. 2010). First, using an operational deï¬nition that distinguished alien from invasive species (McGeoch et al. 2012), a stratiï¬ed, random subset of countries was chosen to calculate the number of invasive species per country. This provided a robust, representative baseline measure of invasion pressure on countries that can now be tracked over time. Second, the well-known IUCN Red List Index (http://www.bipindicators.net/rli/2010; Butchart 2008) was used to illustrate trends in the extinction risk of a subset of species threatened by invasive species. Finally, information on policy trends relevant to invasion was used to indicate how countries were responding to the problem. In sum, by using a combination of systematic data collation, adaptation of an existing indicator, and data on policy trends, an informative indicator for biological invasion was born. Certain metrics can be used to create multiple indicators for different purposes, as illustrated earlier for forest extent (see also Box 12.2). This demonstrates the value and importance of focusing on the key metrics, or Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs; Pereira et al. 2013) that, when cut in certain ways and/or combined with ancillary data, can provide the most information on biodiversity change. Indicators for many of the Aichi Targets can be derived from a relatively small set of such metrics (Geijzendorffer et al. 2016; for an example, see Fig. 1.2). Equally, where metrics can be standardised across scales, there is great potential for efï¬ciency. Although national priorities are generally to develop indicators for speciï¬c national needs (including national goals and targets), there is a lot to be said for exploring and enhancing harmonised indicator use as a means of (i) increasing the availability of data for tracking progress towards broader scale, regional and global goals and targets and (ii) unlocking the value of global data sets, such as those in products derived from satellite remote sensing, for wider national use (Han et al. 2014). Box 12.2.

347,122,0.315,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"We have suggested in this chapter that the main challenges of fisheries governance in the Baltic Sea relate to risk assessmentârisk management interactions and their treatment, communication of different forms of uncertainty, harmonisation of the (interdisciplinary) knowledge base and the organisation of stakeholder participation to improve communication. Based on our case studies, we conclude that current governance structures are not yet capable of fully addressing the problems of scientific uncertainty, interpretations of this uncertainty and connected misunderstandings amongst the different actors in terms of reaching desired outcomes of sustainable fisheries in the Baltic Sea. Increased interactions amongst individual actors, for example, in RACs as well as between different management organisations (e.g. ICES, RAC and the EU Commission), as well as more developed institutional and procedural designs for stakeholder involvement in management and decision-making at the regional level, are urgently needed for improving environmental governance of the Baltic Sea."

126,368,0.315,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Turkana villagersâ urgent requests that the GOK stop the threat to the lake from the Gibe III have been sidelined or ignored altogether. Even widespread pleas by northern Turkana ï¬shing communities for GOK support of their ï¬shing rights in the face of Ethiopia-based commercial ï¬shing fleets exploiting Kenyaâs northern Lake Turkana waters have gone unheeded. Members of the Beach Management Units (government controlled but locally based ï¬sheries management bodies) at Lake Turkana continually complain about the governmentâs refusal to respond to their extreme fear of their livelihood being destroyed by the Omo basin developmentsâand in immediate terms by the large, Ethiopia based commercial ï¬shing boats taking major catch from the northern reaches of Kenyaâs lake. â¢ The GOK failed entirely to inform its vast population in the lake region regarding the actual impacts of the Gibe III and its associated development on their communities, let alone earn for their âfree and informed consent,â as mandated by the United Nations, the African Union and the GOK itself. Chap. 9 briefly described how âcommunity consultationsâ with the AFDBâs socioeconomic impact assessment consultants were orchestrated events with what were clearly predetermined outcomes. Villagers in two different communities where such âconsultationsâ were held reported to SONT (South Omo/North Turkana Research Project) researchers that the AFDB âvisitorsâ gave them assurances that the Gibe III dam would bring major amounts of food, clothing, health care and schooling to their communities. No mention was made of lake retreat or its effects on their ï¬shing, their livestock raising or their households. To the contrary, the consultants repeatedly stressed that the lake âwould not be harmedâ by the dam. In their written report for the AFDB (in 2009), the socioeconomic consultants stated in their report (AFDB 2009) that their role was to describe the âbeneï¬tsâ of the dam for local communities. By all accounts, Kenyan police, local government ofï¬cials and âtranslatorsâ were highly intimidating in these meetings (one of which SONT researchers attended.) Despite the consultantsâ assurances to communities regarding the Gibe III and âpositiveâ conclusions regarding the socioeconomic impacts of the dam in their report back to the AFDB, the consultants did notate (although inconspicuously in the reportâs main textâsee Chap. 6) extreme anger expressed by village elders over the dam project, which they had learned from other sources would bring destruction to their ï¬shing and livestock raising at the lake. The exceptionally low quality of information gathering and analysis by the AFDB socioeconomic impact consultants for the Lake Turkana region, combined with their obvious bias (even self described) throughout the process, underscore the assessmentâs invalidity. There has been no adequate socioeconomic or environmental comprehensive impact assessment of the Lake Turkana region facing extreme crisis. â¢ A major proportion of Turkana pastoralists and ï¬shers settled in villages along Lake Turkana (see Fig. 9.4 and in nearby lands were either omittedâor in some cases. vastly underestimatedâin the GOKâs 2009 census. These communities are therefore unlikely in the extreme to be accounted with the dismantlement of their ï¬shing and pastoral from the effects of lake retreat. Those households and communities surviving destruction from lake retreat who do manage to relocate to a town with the hope of receiving assistance are likely to be regarded as drought victims rather than development victims. Given the highly aridic conditions of the region and the immense distances required, few would be able to reach Kenyaâs international borders to be counted as ârefugeesâ. When discussing their situation and their fear of changes to come, comments such as, You will just come across our bones on the landâ are commonplace among village elders at the lake. Ironically, these types of comments by the Turkana are also common among their northern neighbors, the Dasanech, with whom they are locked into increasing armed conflict in the face of their equally desperate efforts to survive (Fig. 5.3). â¢ Fear of Kenyaâs security forces prevails throughout the northernmost Turkana territory, as these forces are widely known to operate with impunityâincluding with brutality, in some areas. Although to date, the GOK has not exercised politically repressive measures equal to those of the GOE, the government is intolerant of opposition, whether to the Gibe III development or to the widespread incursion of oil corporations into Turkana lands (see Appendix A). Such threats have caused major curtailment of community voice throughout the area. â¢ In 2012, Kenya and Ethiopia, along with the World Bank and the AFDB, announced their partnership to build a USD 1.2 billion energy transmission line from Ethiopia to Kenya: the Eastern Electricity Highway Project, or"

222,792,0.315,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The Q16LS scenario indicates a moderate reduction in the prevalence of poverty and food security, but a collapse of rural income (i.e. farming and fishing) and an enhanced off-farm sectors (this is a scenario and is not dynamically modelled). Income inequality (i.e. GINI), after a sudden drop associated with a significant decrease of farming incomes, gently rises after 2025 with some inter-annual variation. Even though soil salinisation intensifies, drought and the return to the traditional 1990 farming practices drive the collapse of farming. Flooding is minimal under this scenario due to low river flows. The Q8BAU scenario shows a moderate increase in welfare and food security. Inequality is the highest indicating the largest difference between the most poor and the least poor households. Fishing income has a gradual downward trend implying an unsustainable use of fisheries. Farming livelihood similarly declines due to increasing salinisation. Drought also becomes more frequent after 2040. Even though flooding intensity has a high inter-annual variability, it does not have a long-term trend. The Q0MS scenario has an enhanced agriculture (present-day practices but more resilient crops), sustainable fisheries and intensified off-farm activities. This diversity results in large improvements in poverty and food security. However, income inequality is not lower when compared to the other scenarios. This implies that, while the poorest benefit from favourable economic and environmental conditions, the income gap remains. Due to the economic stability of region, inequality starts to decrease very slightly after 2025. The composite hazard indicators indicate an increase in flood intensity and slight decrease in drought. Soil salinity is highly variable, but this scenario has the lowest soil salinity levels. Soil salinity in ÎDIEM is the result of climatic (precipitation, temperature), environmental (drainage, capillary rise, flooding) and anthropogenic (irrigation) factors. Considering the three highlighted scenarios, simulations show a slight increase in soil salinity from 2010 to 2050 under all futures. The categories in Fig. 28.9 correspond to critical soil salinity thresholds. For example, above four deciSiemens per metre (dS/m), vegetables generally do not grow, and above 8 dS/m, most rice varieties stop growing. This makes farming livelihoods very challenging during the dry"

Of course, we hardly expect scientists to be subject to such passions.

198,19,0.315,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract This chapter considers evaluation as essential for learning and for reflecting on whether actions to address the complex challenges pertaining to climate change are on track to producing the desired outcomes. The Paris Agreement of 2015 was an important milestone on the road towards a zero-carbon, resilient, prosperous and fair future. However, while the world has agreed on the need to tackle climate change for sustainable development, it is critical to provide evidence-based analysis of past experiences and ongoing innovations to shed light on how we might enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of actions at various levels. Thorough and credible evaluations help us identify what works, for whom, when and where and under what circumstances in order to mitigate climate change, achieve win-win situations for the society, the economy and the environment, reduce risk and increase resilience in the face of changing climate conditions. This chapter serves as an introduction to the book on Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development that sets the scene on the current state of climate change evaluation and brings together experiences on evaluating climate change policy, mitigation and adaptation.

Such activities were further enhanced by related projects in which I was involved as co-investigator, funded by the UKâs Economic and Social Research Council (via the âUrban Transformation in South Africa Through Co-Designing Energy Services Provisionâ project) as well as Horizon 2020 (âCalculating and Operationalising the Multiple Benefits of Energy Efficiency in Europeâ). Overall, this corpus of activities helped create a motivated and vibrant community of experts and practitioners with a global reach. Also contributing to the intellectual development of this book has been my engagement as a visiting professor at University of Bergenâs Department of Geography (at the Centre for Climate and Energy Transformation), as well as my continued role as an External Professor at the Department of Economic Geography at the University of GdanÌsk. The latter was one of our partners in the EVALUATE project, alongside Charles University, the Central European University, the University of Skopje as well as the Centre for Environmental Research and Information âEko Svestâ. Of note is the recognition afforded to EVALUATE by the University of Krakow, which awarded me a habilitation degree in 2017 in relation to, in part, my work on the project. In 2015, I benefited from the intellectual space associated with a visiting fellowship at the Leibniz Institute for Research on Society and Space. Worthy of particular mention is the rich research environment provided by my home institutionâthe University of Manchester: the Department of Geography, the Collaboratory for Urban Resilience and Energy, and the Manchester Urban Institute. EVALUATE has engaged a team of outstanding individuals whose contribution to the project has been immeasurable: the core group has consisted of Neil Simcock, Sergio Tirado Herrero, Harriet Thomson, Saska Petrova and Thomas Maltby. Some of the papers that I co-authored with some of them form the basis for part of the material presented in this book.

10,20,0.315,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"natural causes, such as drought, but can also be induced by human activities only, or, as is usually the case, may result from the interaction of both (Pereira et al. 2002). Drought is expected to increase in the future as a result of climate change. In 2007 11 % of the European population and 17 % of the European territory were affected by drought (EC 2007). Already, it can be noted that the number of people and areas in Europe affected by drought and water scarcity has increased with 20 % between 1976 and 2006 (EC 2007). The total cost of these 30 years of droughts amounts to 100 billion euros (ibid.). This makes it very important to deal with drought and water scarcity now, and to increase drought resilience before the problem grows even bigger. In the 2007 Communication the European Union clearly states that devising effective drought risk management strategies has to be regarded an EU priority. But in order to optimize drought resilience not only the physical situation must be studied and worked on. The governance setting matters a great deal in determining the effectiveness of drought adaptation measures and facilitating their implementation. Governance ultimately revolves around the social, organizational, political and juridical dimensions and how actors operate in these dimensions to work on issues such as drought resilience. In many instances (technological) innovations for increasing drought resilience do exist, but their implementation is hampered because of factors in the governance setting. As an example, an innovation is developed and tested by a local actor, but its upscaling for broader application is limited because actors in the region do not engage in intensive networking or suffer from the ânot invented hereâ syndrome and the resulting lack of ownership decreases the potential to upscale. Another example is when the ideas for an innovation do exist, but resources lack to fund their proper development, as a result of little experienced urgency for change at regime level. In other words; governance matters, and governance is broader than just the (governmental) actors and their adoption of drought resilience measures. In the upcoming chapters governance and the role of governance in drought resilience will be further discussed, translated into a fully developed governance assessment model, and applied to real-life cases. Through this discussion, development and application we want to provide assistance to practitioners working on increasing drought resilience. This book is primarily written by scientists, but strongly embedded in our interaction with practitioners. Some chapters are also co-written by these practitioners. We believe that this work on the edge of science and practice contributes to an innovative perspective on drought resilience, and is an example of the novelty and applicability of our work."

What is missing from these concerns and the entire OâKane (2013) report is an apparent lack of a rigorous all-encompassing pro-active environmental risk assessment tool as well as one that in addition to environmental and economic attributes considers the incorporation of community or social impacts as a risk factor. Instead, the Report recommends compliance with Australian/New Zealand/ISO Standard AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management-Principles and Guidelines (ISO 31000), a generic risk Standard which although mandatorily required by the 2012 NSW Code of Practice for Coal Seam Gas Fracture Stimulation Activities does not include a risk âtoolâ precluding it from conducting a comprehensive risk assessment unless a risk methodology is incorporated into the already overcomplicated risk process of the Standard. In addition, there is no compliance requirement to use ISO 31000 under the 2012 NSW Code of Practice for Coal Seam Gas Well Integrity an inexplicable divergence of risk management policy which is discussed further below. In Queensland there are two Codes of Practice (CoPs) which have application to CSG; the Code of Practice for constructing and abandoning coal seam gas wells and associated bores in Queensland and the Code of Practice for coal seam gas well head emissions detection and reporting, neither of which mandate a speciï¬c risk assessment tool. Further, the latter of the two is speciï¬c to CSG leaks only whereas the former applies to CSG wells and water bores but, unlike in NSW, there is no CoP which has application to fracking. The lack of speciï¬city relative to fracking in all probability leads to evasion of legal requirements to make the exploration and extraction of CSG safe for groundwater, aquifers and the environment generically."
222,229,0.315,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"floods, (ii) tidal floods, (iii) fluvio-tidal floods and (iv) storm surge floods. While all types of floods can cause damage and disruption, coastal Bangladesh is best known for storm surge flooding due to large historic death toll associated with some of these events most notably between 1970 and 1991 (Nicholls 2006; Alam and Dominey-Howes 2015; Lumbroso et al. 2017). Fluvial and fluvio-tidal flooding is largely dictated by the flow in the major rivers of the delta due to precipitation and run-off upstream. The study area in this research (see Chap. 4, Fig. 4.2) has a large tidal range (three to six metres) which can cause tidal flooding in unprotected (un-poldered) areas. The magnitude of storm surge flooding due to tropical cyclones is also related to the tide; landfall of a cyclone during high tide can cause more extensive storm surge flooding, while cyclone landfall at low tide may not be noticed in terms of water level. The consequences for the resident population are therefore varied. Coastal Bangladesh has an extensive system of coastal embankments and polders built since the 1960s with the goal to reduce flooding, manage water levels and enhance agriculture. While reducing the extent and frequency of coastal flooding, these have greatly modified the flood characteristics and associated coastal morphodynamics and rates of subsidence (e.g. Auerbach et al. 2015). Moreover, there are plans for substantial upgrade to some embankments as part of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BanDuDeltAS 2014). In this chapter, a general overview of the four types of floods defined above is provided, followed by a summary and refection on the need for further research on flooding in coastal Bangladesh. More details of the flood modelling conducted in this research are given in Chap. 16."

106,63,0.315,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Introduction It has been widely proven that in case of emergencies and crisis situations content published on social media platforms, such as Twitter, constitutes a valuable source of information. As stated in Imran et al. (2015), Twitter has been used in various crisis scenarios to identify events, monitor event progress, summarize tweets to give a situational overview and classify them to extract relevant content. In this paper we propose a social media monitoring and analysis framework that provides support to the security sector and is based on the needs of two running H2020-projects in the area of community policing and emergency response, CITYCoP and E2MC. CITYCoP, short for Citizen Interaction Technologies Yield Community Policing, aims at developing applications that facilitate community policing. One idea behind the project is to mine social media platforms to assess the perceived quality of life of the citizens. The purpose of the E2MC project, short for Evolution of Emergency Copernicus services, is to extend the available Copernicus Emergency Management System (EMS) that provides an early warning and rapid mapping services in case of emergencies. By integrating an analysis platform capable of extracting crisis-related information from social media, the quality of the delivered information should be improved and the speed in which the affected area can be located and damage can be assessed should be increased. The main problem we face in both use cases is to flexibly adapt to new scenarios and provide an analysis pipeline that can be operated"
284,200,0.315,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction Mining activity has undeniable environmental impacts due to the nature of its operations, processing plants and foundries. Mining companies proclaim their environmental responsibility by implementing policies that limit environmental risk and impact, while also applying new technologies and production processes that are more respectful of the environment. The degree of efï¬cacy of these sustainability measures and the degree to which companies voluntarily ensure environmental care cannot belie the fact that â no matter what â mining activity has and will always have environmental impacts. There are two major points of view about the subject, according to Whitmore (2006). On the one hand, there are the views of companies â that is to say, the actors who control the mining bulldozers and claim to ensure that everything goes well and that mining is, or can be, sustainable. On the other hand, there are the views of those who are affected by mining activity, such as the communities, peasants and indigenous peoples who are displaced without proper consultation, who suffer illnesses, and whose lifestyles, health and environment are impacted. This chapter will not address the mining problem from the conventional perspective of whether or not mining is sustainable. The majority of the socioenvironmental conï¬icts that arise around mining are focused on this problem.1 We refer to the fact that mining consumes large quantities of water and energy and is one of the most widespread productive activities. As AngloGold Ashantiâs sustainability report declares,2 mining activity has a direct impact on the environment"
34,1055,0.315,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","12.7.3 Recovery and Population Dynamics For any complex system, it is possible to catalogue biodiversity (number of species by taxa). For some species, there are estimates of current population sizes, and perhaps trends in populations. From this review, however, it is clear that even for the key indicator species or groups, current data on population sizes for the entire Gulf are usually sparse. No Gulf-wide surveys are taken at the same time using the same methodology. However, even if sufficient surveys of populations for key species were available, this information does not necessarily provide a picture of the health of the system, predict emergent ecosystem problems, or predict future trends. This is especially true for the Gulf of Mexico because of both short-term (storms, hurricanes, tides, pollution, habitat loss, human disturbance) and long-term stressors (habitat loss, subsidence, global climate change, sea level rise). Detailed information about trophic levels, food web interactions, energy flow, and forcing functions are needed to predict emerging ecosystem change (Brown et al. 2006). This information is not available for the Gulf ecosystem, although the chapters in this series begin to bring together some of this information. However, sufficient information is available to support an integrated weight of evidence evaluation of the health of avian populations in the Gulf of Mexico. The available database includes (1) natural history information (age of first breeding, clutch size, incubation period, parental-care period, and life span); (2) status and trends for key indicator species or species groups; (3) effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on habitat use, and; (4) effects of social interactions (predators, competitors) on habitat use. These factors provide information on whether populations can recover quickly or not. Information on long-term recoveries is available for the species that were devastated during the plume-hunting days of the late 1800s to the early 1900s (herons, egrets, terns), or by exposure to pesticides (Osprey, Brown Pelican), which provides insights into recovery potential. Finally, the long-term sustainability of bird populations in the Gulf is a matter of"

The research reported here builds on those principles, striving to make the science as useful and salient as well as practical. Hence, stakeholders help to shape and identify problem definition, scenario development and results assessment and interpretation. This gives a strong sense of ownership of the research in Bangladesh. Integration is also embedded from the start, and the construction of an integrated model is a key aim and outcome of the project. This model aims to couple a range of biophysical processes together with household livelihood information derived from the analysis of census and detailed household survey results. The coupled nature of the integrated model is unusual if not unique as the influence of biophysical changes on livelihoods and human well-being are calculated directly. As this research developed so the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BanDuDeltAS 2014) emerged as a key policy process which informed this research. It defined issues such as timescales of analysis, a main focus to 2050 but broader interest in possible biophysical trends to 2100. It also defined possible development interventions, such as the benefits of the proposed Ganges Barrage which is designed to increase dry season flows into the study area."
376,907,0.314,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","tion, often covering greater areas and time periods, can be used. This can help to address the challenges of accounting for inter-annual climate variability, even if the same methods are not used, provided that generally co-varying indicators, such as foliar and canopy cover, were measured. Where standard methods and statistical designs were used, even greater benefits can be realized through data integration and direct comparisons. In some cases, issues of data confidentiality or proprietary ownership currently impede data sharing. To the extent possible, these issues should be addressed to foster better data sharing. Participatory monitoring reduces costs and can improve interpretation. Costs may be reduced due to lower labor costs, although these savings are often offset by increased data management costs due to higher quality control costs. Perhaps the most intriguing, and often ignored, benefit of participatory monitoring is for interpretation. Individuals engaged in participatory monitoring often have both local knowledge and information that trained, paid field crews lack. Their knowledge may span both seasons and years, allowing them to identify possible drivers of change, as well as explain anomalous results or outliers."
223,26,0.314,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Kalahari are able to sleuth animals like nobody else. Experienced doctors can diagnose a disease by interpreting a few signs (students of medicine may not have this ability yet). Geographers who are specialists in a certain field of knowledge may draw path-breaking conclusions from a thematic map, whereas other persons will glean no information at all from the same map. Local people living in the Alps may have acquired enough knowledge from previous generations or from personal experience to recognize from scant, subtle indications which places may be endangered by avalanches; most tourists will not be able to evaluate these risks. Many culturally transmitted bodies of knowledge are learned through observation of19 important environmental cues. In fact, observing and interpreting cues and spatial configurations is a long-standing heuristic device of geography. Humans are susceptible to social influence and to the type of information that is available in their environment. Geographies of knowledge and science have illustrated how learning processes, research, and scientific careers can be influenced by the local availability of role models, resources, specific thought styles,20 face-toface contacts to prominent scholars, institutional logics, and organizational rules. The interrelationships of these factors and others constitute the knowledge environment of a place (for details see Meusburger, 2008, 2015a; Meusburger & Schuch, 2012). An extreme example of the impact that different informational environments have on decision-making and acting is given by Gregory (2015, pp. 113â114). Describing World War I battlefields at the western front and the differences between a paper war and a trench war,21 he illustrates the insurmountable gulf between the experienced knowledge of the infantry in the muddy trenches of the battlefield and the abstract knowledge of the staff officers surrounding the map table in a comfortable room and planning the movements of their soldiers for the next days. Scientific evidence from cognitive psychology (see the Chap. 6 by Funke in this volume), sociology (Stehr, 1994, 2005), social geography (Meusburger, 2015a, 2015c; Werlen, 1993b, pp. 8â11), and other research fields shows that there is no direct ifâthen relation between knowledge and action. There are a number of intervening variablesâmany of them related to the environment or place of actionâ that may modify, weaken, or strengthen the relations between knowledge and action. The concurrence and coaction of these variables at a certain place or in a specific area build a spatial context, social environment, or knowledge milieu that may affect decision-making and action. As pointed out by Fiedler and WÃ¤nke (2009, p. 699), properties of the environment can constrain or enhance the input to cognitive processes. These two researchers illustrate that error and bias may often originate in the information environment, in selective accessibility to information; that observations Learning by observing âincludes all cases in which we learn about our environment from observation alone, without intentional experimentationâ (Baron, 2008, p. 14). âThe greater the difference between two thought styles, the more inhibited will be the communication of ideasâ (Fleck, 1935/1979, p. 109). âTrench war is an environment that can never be known abstractly or from the outside. Onlookers could never understand a reality that must be crawled through and lived in. This life, in turn, equips the inhabitant with a knowledge that is difficult to generalize or explainâ (Leed, 1981, p. 79)."

Especially, it is the researcher who makes conceptual and definition choices and determines by these possible outcomes. Ison (2012, p. 145) stresses that (1) reflection about such steps in the making of research and (2) reflexivity about âwhy we do what we doâ are essential to link the researcherâs perspective with the âsituation outside of our selvesâ (Ison 2012, p. 147).

378,56,0.314,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"equated with âthe two great revolutions which have crucially shaped world history: the Neolithic Revolution (the diffusion of arable farming and animal husbandry) and the Industrial Revolution (the transition from an agrarian to an industrial society)â (WBGU 2011b). In line with the focus on the fossil fuel foundations of our current development model, one part of the World in Transition report provides detailed information about how these megatrends impact energy use. It also discusses the technological and economic feasibility of decarbonizing our economies and concludes that decarbonization is possible if a supportive âsocial contractâ between state, civil society, business, science, and research is agreed. In essence this contract involves the agreement that new rules are necessary for the economic system, and also conclusions on how development could subsequently proceed. While many of the contractâs rules will impact on very structural technological, economic, political and ecological path dependencies, the prime root for its conclusion lies in the sociocultural domain: the ethical basis that can bind such diverse interests could lie in our responsibility toward future generations, combined with ecological responsibility and a culture of democratic participation. If the contract were based on such a visionary agreement (read: a better purpose for development), it would provide the legitimizing backdrop from which a âproactive stateâ engaged to change the rules and incentives so that sustainability transformations could proceed. As a potent manifestation of the contract the country could embed sustainable development or climate protection into the constitution. Wide discussion of such a new social contract is intended to generate the political will and public support necessary to break some of the current barriers to policy change, namely powerful interests vested in the fossil-fuel-based infrastructures and consumption patterns of our economies today. The antidote to powerful lobbyists is public opinion, which the authors claim has undergone a signiï¬cant shift in the direction of environmental awareness and post-materialist value sets. The Gallup Instituteâs World Values Survey is cited as one important base of evidence for this, as are the ongoing initiatives on new measures of progress, wealth and well-being. Thus, the new social contract would ï¬nd its expression not primarily on paper but rather in peopleâs consciousness: it changes what they judge to be appropriate and desirable policy and product options (WBGU 2011c: 2). Adopting the STRN concepts, the report foresees that extended participation of enlightened citizens would not only legitimize but also improve policy implementation, which creates new room for pioneering sustainable business and citizen practices that test prototype practices for a sustainable society. These may turn into niche solutions, like an eco-village, a car-sharing business or a renewable energy cooperative but also possibly set a new trend. Such pioneers of sustainability practices operate in all parts of society, business, non-governmental organizations, culture and even in political decision-making. These emerging solutions put visions into practice and provide proof to policymakers that alternatives to fossil-based energy dependence are not only thinkable"

More and better participation, and a substantial improvement in training, are a priority for all governments. This aspect was particularly stressed at Rio+20. Environmental governance of the land, patrimonial accounts, environmental assessment of investment projects, evaluation of environmental impacts, strategic environmental assessments and so forth are emerging as important alternatives. According to ECLAC (2010:140), âTerritorial heterogeneity in Latin America calls for selective and targeted strategies. Local development, understood as a bottom-up process, mobilizes endogenous potential to build territories that are better able to create and drive their own capacities.â The objectives of the National Environmental Governance Project in each country must reverse the process of poverty generation and, in turn, give more momentum to tasks already under way to directly improve the situation. Habitat improvement and policies to combat environmental degradation are systematically integrated with the possibility for a better life. In addition, the use of unusual environmental policies in Latin American countries â such as tax policies, credit, tariff or integration â all signify that there is a long way to go. While these ideas are technologically plausible, and are also key for the sustainability of the planet, it is worth reiterating critical doubts that arise from both historical experience and theory. They question the ability of the current model of accumulation and the political regime of domination to advance socioeconomic and environmental sustainable development, without signiï¬cant changes. The historical scenario seems to prolong an insurmountable contradiction between the interests to produce, distribute and consume, and the need to ensure social and environmental human life. Therefore, a greater organization and activity of environmental social movements emerges as a possible alternative. An organizational form for sustainable development within environmental governance involves a holistic view, a direct relationship between research and action. It is a combination of the short, medium and long term, and of a generally high level of participation among civil society and social movements. It proposes implementing the necessary changes and taking actions that can lead to more successful forms of environmental governance and a better quality of life. Economic understanding must be open to all necessary actors, which requires reformulating the conditions for recovery and reproduction of capital with ecological, economic, social, technological and political implications. Only then do the desired reduction of poverty and reconciliation with nature truly begin."

38,315,0.314,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Efï¬cient investment of resources in protecting freshwater species requires combining actions targeted at the level of ecosystems and landscapes and those that target individual species of conservation concern. The efforts invested in freshwater biodiversity observations and the evaluation of monitoring data must take into account the need to achieve a balance between information needed on individual species of concern with information on other components of biodiversity (such as community composition; Box 7.3, Fig. 7.3a). In prioritising species for monitoring or for repeated or long-term observations, some of the major factors to consider are the level of threat (IUCN Red List status; local classiï¬cations of species at risk or the relevant protected-species legislation); regional freshwater conservation targets; community interest in iconic species or those otherwise of particular concern to humans; and species that are essential as sources of food or habitat for threatened species. Actions that can address the threats to freshwater ecosystems across drainage basins or in broader regions are especially important for conserving biodiversity, but these actions must be prioritised so that resources are spent where greatest beneï¬ts can be achieved. Freshwater conservation planning tools can help this prioritisation (Box 7.3 Fig. 7.3b; also see Linke et al. 2011). Such tools require data"
232,4,0.314,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in March 2011 sparked a debate about the nuclear safety. While releases of large amounts of radioactive materials resulted in no casualties due to radiation, the impact particularly on local communities is substantial and manifold. Although local communities want to be ensured that effective actions are being taken to allow them to go back to their normal life as early as possible, the lack of understanding for the transport of radioisotopes in the environment and eventually the uptake in humans as well as in the biological effects of low dose radiation has made it difï¬cult for various stakeholders to develop concerted efforts to accelerate recovery. These challenges are compounded by the eroded public trust for government and operators. To address this need, a multidisciplinary initiative is carried out by scientists at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), MINES ParisTech, and Tokyo University to provide the necessary guidance for effective assessment and remediation efforts and to provide trusted, unbiased, and nuclear-industry-independent perspective to build trust with local and global communities. Based on such on-going initiatives, there are two emerging questions: (1) how integration between understanding for natural scientiï¬c processes and understanding for a society at different scales and regions can be achieved for the objective of accurate monitoring, and then ultimately (2) how such accurate monitoring and public participation can and should be integrated in decision-making processes for achieving a resilient society. To address such questions and to develop a research plan, we hosted, in March 2015,2 a two-day international workshop in UC Berkeley. In this workshop, ï¬rst, we share various observations about âdamagesâ in a severe nuclear accident and"

9,401,0.314,"One Hundred Years of Chemical Warfare : Research, Deployment, Consequences","6 Conclusion The failure of the US Senate to ratify the Geneva Protocol reflected contrary imaginations and vested interests in the American military, industry, science, and perhaps in public opinion as well. We are accustomed to seeing the protocol as a milestone in the establishment of a diplomatic and moral norm of lasting importance. However, the circumstances of 1925â26 were signiï¬cant in themselves, having wider consequences that accompanied and foreshadowed deeper conflicts. In particular, we can seeâand not just between the linesâevidence of a will to power shown by the natural sciencesâthe ânew bosses of war,â as one commentator put it (Slotton 1990, 494). The war had demonstrated a new-found sense of national commitment among American scientists; in the post-war world, the question was how best to âbossâ the business of war-related science. Some wanted to keep chemical weapons research under the civilian administration of the Bureau of Mines. But the advantages of a closer connection with the military were clear. The precedent set by the debate would not be lost on those planning atomic weapons research after the Second World War. The protocol debate anticipated by 35 years President Eisenhowerâs warnings that public policy could become the âcaptive of a scientiï¬c-technological eliteâ (Jones 1980, 439). The early 1920s offered reason for both hope and fearâthe twin legacies of the Enlightenment. The emerging relationship between science and the military weighed heavily on the conscience of those who, like J.D. Bernal, saw in the outcome of the protocol debate fresh cause to re-examine the politics of science. He and others were inspired to argue that, if science was to have a future, it must show social responsibilityâa theme that gained prominence during and after the Great Depression of the 1930s. How rival nations would in future justify their use of the âworst weaponâ would take on new deï¬nition, and its uses would soon occupy new spaces outside Europe and North America, in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. But that is another story, for another time."

182,99,0.314,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"research and practice. This, in turn, prompted wider transformationsâ in the zoosâ physical structures as post-mortem rooms and more sanitary animal enclosures were built; in their ânaturalâ landscapes as unhealthy swamps were drained; and in their social organization, as new staff were employed to manage health and investigate disease. The health of zoo animals therefore provides a unique perspective on the history of the zoo and its animal inhabitants. In health, disease and death, zoo animals inspired medical men to engage with them, both directly within the zoo, and remotely via the traces they left on the medical record. This chapter has revealed how both humans and animals were produced through these relationships. Animals were transformed into patients, victims of their environments, pathological material, and points of comparison across species, while human doctors became healers and investigators of animals. In the process, perceptions of what it meant to be human or animal changed. âIn-houseâ efforts to improve animal health proceeded on the basis that animals were sufficiently close to humans to permit the application, by doctors, of ideas and practices drawn from human medical contexts. In practice, however, animalsâ resistance to handling and their unusual anatomiesâwhich attracted medical attention independently of the pathologies they displayedâplaced limits on the wholesale importation of human medicine into the zoo. Likewise, while investigations into comparative pathology reinforced notions that humans and animals (particularly monkeys) were sufficiently similar to allow deductions about the former to be drawn from the latter, they also highlighted key differences that were attributed to, and served to consolidate ideas about, their evolutionary relationships. In these ways, the practice of medicine within the zoo simultaneously brought humans and animals closer together, and demarcated the distances between them. Medical interventions in the zoo also had implications for animal, and to a lesser extent, human health. Some of the zoosâ more valuable mammalian inhabitants probably did benefit from zoological society efforts, especially those directed towards environmental improvements. Mortality statistics are not particularly useful in revealing such benefits because they refer to all species. Also, it should be noted that without medical interventions, mortality rates may have been even higher. Rickets provides the best example of a disease whose management in humans was advanced through investigations performed on zoo animals. However, this chapter has provided many other examples of doctors"

Moreover, compared to the prior political technology, investment in general infrastructure (Î³ 4) is much more effective in generating t.p. in the trading and public service sectors, according to the policy beliefs of all stakeholders. Analogously, for generating t.p. in the industrial sectors, stakeholder beliefs commonly indicate a comparatively high efficiency of pillar IV policies (e.g., the promotion of extension services (Î³7) and R&D activities (Î³8) (see Table 5 in the Appendix). 3. However, some divergences in policy beliefs also exist between different stakeholder organizations. For example, the civil society cluster (4) believes in contrast to all other stakeholder clusters that investment in infrastructure and the promotion of R&D activities are especially effective in generating t.p. in the agribusiness sector (see Table 5 in the Appendix). 4. Overall, based on our analyses, we conclude that two worlds exist: the scientific world of economic modelers that corresponds to the prior political technology and the world of stakeholders operating as practical experts in Malawi, which is encapsulated in the observed common policy beliefs. These two worlds are nicely illustrated in Fig. 4, where we plotted the factor scores of stakeholder organizations derived from a factor analysis of their stated policy positions, first assuming that policy positions are derived from policy beliefs (blue dots on the left) and second assuming that policy positions are derived from political support maximization assuming that stakeholders adopt the prior political technology as the true political technology (red dots on the right). Hence, our analyses imply a cleavage between the world of economic modeling and the world of political practice."
164,64,0.314,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","The marginality framework takes into account the diversity of causes of people living in poverty. As this diversity of factors causing poverty is frequently clustered, it has been referred to as âcausal complexesâ or âmarginality patternsâ by Gatzweiler et al. (2011, 9). Examples of such patterns are low agricultural productivity caused by an inability to irrigate as a result of water shortages due to low water tables and the lack of collective action resulting from central planning that in turn cause critical human health conditions under which the elderly, woman, and children suffer most and therefore cannot contribute their labor or receive education, which limits their ability to change or escape the systems they are part of. Causal complexes that are self-referential systemic feedback loops are also referred to as âpoverty trapsâ (Dasgupta 2009). Marginality is caused by complexes of interrelating factors that are seldom directly observable. Conceptualizing marginality in terms of causal complexes or networks requires shifting the focus from isolated causal entities to the relationships"

Effects on nature and people are first experienced in cities as cities form microcosms with extreme temperature gradients, and by now, about half of the human population globally lives in urban areas. Climate change has significant impact on ecosystem functioning and well-being of people. Climatic stress leads to a decrease in the distribution of typical native species and influences society through health-related effects and socio-economic impacts by increased numbers of heat waves, droughts and flooding events. In addition to climate change, urbanisation and the accompanying increases in the number and size of cities are impacting ecosystems with a number of interlinked pressures. These pressures include loss and degradation of natural areas, soil sealing and the densification of built-up areas, which pose additional significant challenges to ecosystem functionality, the provision"
36,464,0.314,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"6. Detailed meta-analyses of existing data on cumulative fatality impacts and factors influencing fatalities are needed. It should be noted that data disclosure from many sites by some companies hinders such analyses. We strongly encourage developers to follow guidelines (e.g., Kunz et al. 2007b; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Strickland et al. 2011; Bat Conservation Ireland 2012) consistently when implementing pre- and post-construction monitoring. Data should be placed into the public domain or preferably published in refereed journals. There are a number of policies, regulatory, and communication challenges we face in protecting bats while developing wind energy responsibly across the globe (Arnett 2012). Unless there is a federal, state, or provincial nexus, most research, siting, and mitigation efforts by wind energy developers and operating companies will be voluntary, likely without regard for cumulative effects. Sites that do trigger a regulatory nexus will usually be driven by endangered species issues (e.g., Indiana bats in the USA). It is apparent most local jurisdictional entities, regardless of country, lack experience in wildlife science, and unless they coordinate with their wildlife or natural resource agency specialists, concerns about bat fatalities may never be addressed in decision making for wind energy development. Another key issue is consistent application of regulations. The authors have encountered many situations where different individuals had varied interpretations of the same law or guidance policy, and this creates untenable situations, considerable uncertainty, consternation, and lack of trust among stakeholders that seems completely unnecessary and easily remedied (Arnett 2012). We encourage continuing cooperation among all stakeholders, gathering needed information, avoiding construction in high-risk sites, considering cumulative effects, and implementing mitigation where needed even when no regulatory process is triggered (Arnett 2012; Arnett and Baerwald 2013). Wind energy developers should, however, be treated fairly and consistently to ensure proactive measures are implemented. Arnett (2012) noted that when some companies choose to cooperate, while others may not, unnecessary angst is generated and deters resolving wildlife impacts and other issues. Decision making must be based on the best available science. Also, consistent policy, accountability, effective siting and mitigation strategies, and a âlevel-playing fieldâ for the industry (i.e., consistent requirements and incentives for all companies) are fundamental if we are to successfully develop wind energy that protects bats and other wildlife.

277,405,0.314,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"the mass media: there are both scientists and policymakers who try to use the media to their advantage and they use similar strategies. It is one of the hallmarks of contemporary politicised research-policy dialogues on migrant integration that public officials have most trust in those researchers who depend on them most. And they mistrust so-called âindependent scientistsâ, notwithstanding peer-review mechanisms, because they feel that these people have a (hidden) political agenda and are interested in promoting their political ideals.7 The scientists after all may even propose certain measures on the basis of empirical research and call them âevidence-based policiesâ, while in reality the evidence is not so strong and the recommendations are mainly based on normative preferences. Of course, due to the direct financial links between for example SCP and the ministry it advices, the argument could also be made that SCP researchers are less âobjectiveâ than seemingly untouchable professors at universities. This chapter contended earlier that the current literature on research-policy dialogues in the Netherlands is primarily concerned with politicisation. The section on the three subtopics explored the role of mediatisation and tentatively concluded that more attention to this aspect is warranted. The empirical analysis suggests that mediatised dialogue structures differ from non-mediatised ones as opportunity structures for influencing migrant integration policy. In fact, there may be a new Boundary, which is the one between non-mediatised and mediatised research-policy dialogues. By this we mean that scientists who wish to have policy impact can take two routes nowadays. The first, more traditional route is to communicate with policymakers directly. In practice this mostly happens in private, i.e. without media coverage, in so-called âboundary organisationsâ like committees, advisory bodies and think-tanks, at conferences, informal workshops, dinners, etc. The second route is to communicate with policymakers indirectly, via the media. In the project we have found numerous examples of public intellectuals who have developed media strategies to influence migrant integration policymaking. One interesting avenue for future research, we believe, is to find out whether the two routes âadd upâ, i.e. whether researchers have to choose or not. There is some evidence (also see the British case) that both routes are to a certain extent alternatives. This is because communicating via the media has a âcostâ: put simply, scientists who choose the public route tend to take more critical positions and this decreases the likelihood that they also interact with policymakers directly in more private networks. There are relations between the tone and content of the researchersâ messages, their media presence, and the usefulness of their expertise as perceived by policymakers. For example, some researchers see the world of newspapers as âa totally different realityâ (interview). Scientists who do not have direct, private access to policymakers feel"

Furthermore, there have been multiple large-scale efforts to investigate the accident, while new regulatory framework was introduced (see Juraku in this volume on post-disaster investigative efforts and their impact). However, despite these efforts at reflection and momentary openness to change that followed, much of the older imaginaries remain today, dictating policy and political debates, as well as the way the public can engage with decision processes."
221,148,0.314,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"The adoption of policies to reduce GHG emissions help to avoid the risks of climate change. Such risks include reduced potential crop yields in most tropical and subtropical regions due to the increase in temperature; reduced and changed crop yields in most regions at mid-latitudes due to the increase in average annual temperature; reduced water supplies in areas of water scarcity, especially in the subtropics; increases in the number of people exposed to vector-borne diseases (such as malaria) and water-borne diseases (such as cholera) and mortality due to heat stress (heat stress, mortality); increases in the risk of widespread flooding of many residential areas due to increased rainfall and sea level rise; and increased energy demand for cooling due to higher temperatures in the summer. The implementation of GHG reduction policies in these areas will help to avoid the costs or potential losses that are caused by climate change impacts."
302,384,0.314,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), which deals with risks to human health, published a statement saying on the one hand that they could not detect microplastics in honey and beer in their laboratory studies. On the other hand, they stated that the health risk posed by microplastic-contaminated food and beverages cannot be assessed, due to the lack of reliable data and analytical methods [54]. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) started taking first steps toward a future assessment of the potential risks to consumers from microplastics and nanoplastics in food, especially seafood. Uncertainty exists, first, about the scope and quality of the contamination and, second, about the negative health effects for the public. The media reports led to a raised public awareness of health risks, but the risk management authorities could not clear up the concerns, because despite that their studies had not verified the claim of microplastics in honey and beer, the question remains, if negative effects for human health exist. This feeling of insecurity is also reflected in the consumer survey by the BfR [55], which shows that 63% of the respondents had heard about âmicroplastics in foodâ and 52% answered that they were âconcerned about microplastics in foodâ. This case shows that there are only single observations of microplastics in food for human consumption and no scientific evidence for negative effects for human health exists. No general statement about risk for human health can be made; nevertheless, people are worried since a hypothetical risk has been communicated. Thus, due to the communication about the hypothetical risk, it becomes symbolically relevant in the first place, and a risk for human health is constructed. Therefore, risk communication is a very important aspect of risk management, with regard to the perception and psychological reactions of people who feel they are at risk. To reduce the social amplification of risk, it is important for laypersons that experts address risks and contextualize them in relations to other risks. Research on risk perception has pointed out that public opinion is steered by media reports scandalizing or exaggerating minor risks, leading to the spending of money to reduce them, while other major risks that failed to attract public attention are insufficiently considered [56, 57]. Risk managers should be sensitive to this and not become misguided by media and public concerns."

269,173,0.313,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"And yet, at the heart of our different projects in this area, there has always been an intuition that a potent, (potentially) emancipatory politics of race, gender, class, or sexuality might not have to be always independent of the biological sciences. In pursing that intuition, we have been inspired, for example, by the work of the NeuroGenderings research collective, and by the potent forms of neurofeminism that many of the scholars within that loose agglomeration have insisted on locating at the heart of empirical brain research (Bluhm, Jacobson and Maibon 2012; Schmitz and HÃ¶ppner 2014a, 2014b). We have learnt a great deal from scholars such as Gillian Einstein and Margrit Shildrick, who, in their reinvigoration of the politics of womenâs health, have always insisted on the complementarity of feminist theory and biological research on womenâs bodies (Einstein and Shildrick 2009). And we continue to be propelled by broader movements, within feminist theory, that are working to destabilize (to de-nature, we might say) the suturing of politics to critique, showing how feminist (and other social) theories might yet be traced through neurobiological histories and practices (Barad 2007; Rose and Abi-Rached 2013; Wilson 2004). If our own projects maintain a committed attention to the ways in which epistemic and cultural privileges can be put to work in the generation or sustenance of some deeply worrying relations of power, still, we have tried to show, in the empirical work that we have produced, that an interdisciplinary attention to brain and mind can also unsettle these relations in sometimes unexpected ways; that neuroimaging studies, themselves, can sometimes themselves be the bearers of critical practices."
197,154,0.313,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"with urban processes that evolve and develop over long periods of time. This shows how energy transitions create displacements that are reflected within multiple spatio-temporal scales and thematic areas of activity. Vulnerability to domestic energy deprivation thus cannot be considered as a household issue, but rather a phenomenon that is distributed throughout the âenergy chainâ (Chapman, 1989)âan issue that warrants further research in the domain of energy geographies (Calvert, 2015). As argued previously (Bouzarovski et al., 2017) such findings call for a rethink of the conceptual assumptions that inform wider sustainability transitions frameworks, by considering the material and infrastructural characteristics of place and space as contingencies that deserve customized conceptual attention. Domestic energy deprivation does not bring about a passive and reactive set of behaviours and practices within households and institutions (Bouzarovski, Tirado Herrero, Petrova, & Ãrge-Vorsatz, 2016). Rather, the diverse strategies that are articulated with respect to the condition have far-reaching effects on the systemic conditions that underpin the emergence of energy poverty. They can thus potentially challenge the triad of distribution, procedure and recognition that dominates current understandings of the injustices that underpin fuel and energy poverty (Walker & Day, 2012) by introducing notions of spatial justice into the debate (Bouzarovski & Simcock, 2017). The work reviewed in this book also points to the need for developing a more explicit conceptual and policy link between domestic energy deprivation and the implementation of climate policies. Ex ante studies focusing on the co-benefits and multiple benefits of energy efficiency interventions (Ãrge-Vorsatz, Tirado Herrero, Labzina, & Foley, 2012) have highlighted the significant welfare-enhancing effects of thermal retrofitsâa key infrastructural solution often prescribed in the policy-oriented literature. However, high or increasing levels of domestic energy deprivation complicate the application of policies that promote energy vulnerability-enhancing measures, such as renewable feed-in tariffs or surcharges paid by domestic energy users irrespective of income, needs or living conditions. In a number of European countries, the expansion of energy poverty among the general population has been accompanied by the adoption of household strategies orientated towards carbon-intensive and polluting fuels, such as coal or firewood (Bouzarovski et al., 2016). Throughout the book, I have argued in favour of developing a deeper understanding of the manner in which material deprivation both arises out"
221,448,0.313,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Background and Policies LoCARNet is an open network of researchers, research organisations and likeminded relevant stakeholders that facilitates the formulation and implementation of science-based policies for low-carbon development in Asia. A new international framework currently being considered by UNFCCC includes all GHG emitter countries from 2020 and beyond. In order to stabilise global climate, in addition to developed countries being required to drastically reduce their GHG emissions, those of developing countries will also need to be reduced based on their predicted increases. If trends in mass energy consumption and growth continue, by 2050 Asia will account for half of total global emissions, which will also cause heavy concomitant impact on the regionâs populations. On the other hand, if the substantial investments are redirected towards creating low-carbon societies, Asia could lead the world in low-carbon development. Right now, we are standing at the crossroads. All countries in the Asian region are currently working on plans to achieve low-carbon development. Numerous policy steps are involved, and the formulation of such plans requires scientific knowledge spanning a broad spectrum of fields. It is thus plainly apparent that an interdisciplinary community for researchers and research organisations needs to be formed. Also, as policies for low-carbon development involve important decisions that determine a countryâs future potential, each country should have the right to self-determination in formulating these policies, therefore must have its own robust, scientific research footings. While the above calls for establishing unique foundations, commonalities exist in the regional environment and in stages of development. In this regard, the exchange of scientific knowledge amongst researchers in Asian countries in respective areas of expertise will greatly promote science-based low-carbon policies, and reinforcing the scientific base to bolster the formulation of policies for low-carbon development in each country in the region will require a quantum leap in cooperation, not only from researchers and research communities but also"
36,228,0.313,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"long-term population stability of organisms found in less disturbed areas (Ricketts 2001; Laurance 2008; Perfecto and Vandermeer 2010; Tscharntke et al. 2012). On a local scale, different agricultural management approaches often coexist. Some rely on varying chemical inputs (pesticides, fertilizer), or novel plant types (e.g., genetically modified crops incorporating genes for characteristics such as insecticide functions), resulting in environmental contamination, pollution, and dissemination of toxins that could negatively impact biodiversity across multiple spatial scales (Nelson et al. 2009; Power 2010). As a consequence, agricultural management has effects not only on biodiversity, but also on human health and economies. In the tropics, the expansion of export-oriented agriculture results from population growth and shifts in consumption patterns of developing nations, and is carried out mostly to the detriment of old growth forests and extensively managed grasslands such as pastures (Defries et al. 2010; Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011). As a consequence, croplands are still expanding dramatically, and agricultural practices are likely to further intensify in the near future (more chemical and mechanical inputs, reliance on genetically modified plants with novel manufactured traits). Short-term increases in yield will come at the cost of reduced structural and taxonomic diversity within agricultural systems (Loos et al. 2014) and concomitant loss of crucial ecosystem services. An additional factor affecting agriculture in the Anthropocene is climate change and the need to adapt cultures to novel environmental conditions: Many areas may become unsuitable for cultivation of their current dominant crops, while extreme weather events may result in reduced yields. Resulting declines in calorie availability, particularly in the developing world (Nelson et al. 2009), will increase the need for agricultural practices that meet both productivity and sustainability goals (Tilman et al. 2002; McShane et al. 2011; Tscharntke et al. 2012). These trends portend major shifts in land-use patterns (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011) and hence biodiversity, with agricultural intensification, forest and tree roost loss anticipated to have particularly negative effects on bat species richness, abundance, and functional diversity (Fischer et al. 2009, 2010; Jones et al. 2009). These emerging trends pose major threats to farmland bat assemblages and populations (Jones et al. 2009; Kunz et al. 2011) and could negatively impact human populations by altering the ecosystem services that bats provide. Thus, there is a critical need to assess how agricultural management affects bat populations, and how affected bat populations will in turn affect agricultural production. In this chapter, we review the effects of agricultural land use and management on bat assemblages and the behavior and ecology of individual bat species at field, farm, and landscape scales (Vickery and Arlettaz 2012). We also review the developing literature on ecosystem servicesâand disservicesâprovided by bats in agricultural areas. Finally, we synthesize this information to suggest key management recommendations necessary to maintain bat populations in agricultural landscapes and highlight critical knowledge gaps that must be resolved in order to conserve bat diversity and ecosystem functions in a planet increasingly dominated by food production."

Some contaminants were released into the environment years ago and persist, while others continue to be released. Contaminants, in particular the SVOCs and metals that are the focus of this summary, are found in industrial and municipal discharges and emissions, urban and agricultural runoff, accidental spills, and wet and dry atmospheric deposition. Of the 11 environmental concerns identified in United States (U.S.) estuaries, 8 potentially involve contaminants and collectively affect all of the 28 estuaries considered (Figure 4.1). Releases of contaminants to the environment can be intentional (e.g., permitted discharges) and/or accidental (e.g., spills). Contaminants enter marine environments through the air, dissolved in or absorbed on particles in water, or as solid or liquid discharges. Hydrophobic compounds released into air and water preferentially adsorb onto particulate matter, and often, some portion is eventually deposited in sediments. Contaminants discharged as solids and liquids can result in rapid incorporation into sediments. Concentrations and geographic distributions of sediment contaminants are heterogeneous due to spatial and temporal variations in inputs, sediment deposition and accumulation rates, variable susceptibility to contamination and rates of removal, variations in chemical form and physicochemical properties, and differences in water inflow rates and receiving water residence times. Considerations of contaminant SVOCs in sediments are restricted to those chemicals most commonly studied including hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (see Appendix A for details of the origins, toxicity, and environmental fate of SVOCs). Hydrocarbons are generally measured as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are the portion of petroleum that accounts for most of its toxicity. The contaminant metals considered are those of greatest environmental concern including lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), barium (Ba), vanadium (V), and copper (Cu) (see Appendix B for details of the origins, toxicity, and environmental fate of metals)."

Really engaging the students successfully means starting with them where they are, iteratively exploring with them rather than lecturing at themâwhatever the expectations that their own field sets about how education actually works. Exploring in this way is a challenge to do within the framework of their existing curriculum. At least, it is a challenge to do in a satisfactory way. More time and depth are needed to get past the flattening of social science to a set of recognizable tools or a body of largely pre-intuitable societal knowledge. We will need more, and longer-term, engagements if we want to get across its power as a set of alternative methodological strategies for getting a grip on the world. The starting point for the PAGES collaboration was this realization: interdisciplinary collaboration is hard. That proved true all along the way. When it succeeded in PAGES, the outcome had much to do with trust, voice, and personal relationships. The only adequate way to close is with admiration for those colleagues and NE students and postdocs who made it possible for social scientists to engage with nuclear engineers."

Models that are good for one purpose may not be good for other purposes. Understanding the uncertainty and, hence, the utility of a modelâany model, but especially climate modelsârequires extensive testing against observations. Evaluation of climate models requires some fundamental understanding of the observations themselves. What is the uncertainty and accuracy in the observations? As we discuss in detail in Chap. 10, knowing the uncertainty in our observations is an important part of being able to evaluate the uncertainty in models. Evaluating climate models is done in many ways but is often done similar to weather models. Models are evaluated on their representation of past events, either a single event or a statistical series of events. Evaluation of climate models can also show where critical processes need to be better understood to constrain climate model projections. For example, since cloud processes and responses to environmental changes are uncertain, better representation and evaluation of clouds in climate models is critical."

Thus, in addition to aggregating individual medical data, epidemiologists need to measure the impact of various social factors on health. To tackle the complex, often competing health needs of social groups, public health practitioners need to dialogue and partner with their communities. At a higher administrative level, public health officials need to manage intersectoral collaborations, navigate political processes, and formulate public health law. Four distinguishing features of public health practiceâ the pursuit of the collective good, a focus on prevention, the use of government or collective action, and an emphasis on an outcome-based (utilitarian) approachâ generate most of the ethical challenges public health practitioners typically face (Faden and Shebaya 2010)."

These networks that are coalitions of actors who share values, interests and practices can be conceptualized as elites insofar as they control key resources: the production and promotion of speciï¬c knowledge or forms to generate knowledge and access to policymaking forums. Ideas, values and resources circulate within networks, and as such the networks may set the limits or boundaries of how reality is to be understood or to set apart what constitutes expert and non-expert knowledge. A range of different private actors and companies support REDD activities, forming alliances and promoting certain models, particularly those that are positive to carbon markets. In this way, REDD is offering a new regime of proï¬t-making possibilities in the trade of carbon offsets, but also in fostering the development of new forms of consultancy and expertise. REDD science-policy networks are inï¬uencing, although not necessarily reorienting, the position of other elite actors. For example, various transnational and national companies, such as mining and energy-producing companies, plantation companies, forestry companies and carbon-market companies, engage in REDD demonstration activities by funding speciï¬c projects. Since dominant REDD science-policy networks have ideological positions that do not conï¬ict with the ideological position of corporations, it has been possible to establish alliances between them. But since resource extraction continues to be central to the economies of most Amazon countries (Bebbington and Bebbington, 2012), often at the expense of forests, the degree to which REDD elites can inï¬uence other elites is limited. Mining, gas and oil extraction are the most important activities to generate economic revenues for most of the countries in the Amazon basin. The development of infrastructure such as hydropower and road-building are also priorities for these countries. All these activities are, in most cases, planned to occur in forest areas. In addition, the agricultural frontier is expanding in many Latin American countries. Therefore we cannot afï¬rm that REDD elites have a strong inï¬uence in the Amazon countriesâ broader development policy-making or in the national visions of development, but REDD elites have indeed been successful in engaging actors from the agricultural and industrial sectors in the funding of demonstration activities. Taken together, the cases of Brazil and of REDD show that a shift in elites sometimes leads to more ambitious environmental goals and"

198,142,0.313,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Requests by funding agencies for a move towards outcome-oriented research programs are having considerable impact on the way in which research is conceived, planned, implemented and evaluated. A key requirement for such work is flexibility â the flexibility to adjust so that the outcome orientation works as a support mechanism and enabler rather than a one-size-fits-all straitjacket without any space for innovation, serendipity and creativity. The shift to a R4D approach based on TOC is fostering massive change, much of it for the better, in our view. However, it also comes with considerable challenges. Defining the necessary changes, and developing new processes and mechanisms, need time and resources, which are often grossly underestimated and inadequately planned for. Some of these challenges arise because of the nature of research: the results are not known from the start, unlike in engineering where the outcomes are generally much less uncertain. Another challenge is that CGIAR is a R4D organization, not a development organization, and it is still in the process of sorting out how to balance the need to do great science with the need for impact. We need to avoid the resultsbased focus being to the disadvantage of the science, and development being seen to be in competition with the science. Rather, they need to be seen as complementary, enabling, and liberating."

There are many models and assessment tools that can be used to support the transition process to a bioeconomy when using their modelling results in scenarios. Our selection of included models is only a small part of the variety of modelling approaches and is certainly not the be-all and end-all. Modelling approaches and theories are undergoing constant development and must also be constantly reconsidered. All the presented models, tools, and different types of scenarios can assist in picturing possible futures and can support transitioning to a bioeconomy. However, by no means can they predict the future. Still, the transformation cannot take place through maintaining the present, Western civilization lifestyle nor by expanding this lifestyle to the whole world. Humanity must change its way of life to reach a sustainable bioeconomy. Review Questions â¢ The expectations for a viable bioeconomy are enormous. What drivers and societal challenges affect a developing bioeconomy? Thus, what difficulties result for a holistic modelling of future scenarios of bioeconomy? â¢ A main disadvantage of scenarios is often seen in their shortcoming to offer verifiable scientific knowledge.

The transformation and system innovation discourse brings the need for encompassing structural change to the forefront and to the titles of flagship reports, while slowly delegitimizing the narrow emphasis on adaptive market magic, money printing and technological breakthroughs. To me, this is part of the window of renewed opportunity for sustainable development. The rapidly growing transdisciplinary transformation research community could become instrumental in helping to use this window strategically. It promises the most telling insights into how the infamous integration of ecological, social and economic dimensions of development can be achieved in practice."

97,424,0.312,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","transportation or drainage. In addition, in the case of flood risk, measures for vulnerability reduction include the creation of buffer zones, retention ponds or increased permeable surfaces, for instance through the promotion of green roofs or urban agriculture. In the case of heat, measures include drought-resistant plants and improved insulation (e.g. through green walls). In the context of response preparedness, typical measures include early warning systems and preparations for temporary refuge. In this context, nature-based solutions include well-designed green areas that can provide space for temporary shelter or protection (e.g., use of elevated green platforms during flash floods). Another example is the preparation of cooling mechanisms or structures. These include mobile planting systems or fountains, which can be used during heatwaves. Recovery preparedness measures through nature-based solutions can include the use of materials or green infrastructure elements that can be easily recovered or replaced, along with preparations for post-disaster assistance. Examples are designated green areas that can be used for accommodation during reconstruction, preparations for the clearing or re-use of rubble (including green materials), or the provision of health and psychological support. The latter can include the support for greening private lots, being a multi-purpose measure with positive impacts on health and well-being. Other preparedness measures are awareness-raising campaigns and guidance on what to do after certain hazards, which can be linked to nature-based solutions (e.g. environmental learning parks). Although the contribution of naturebased solutions is often more indirect and contingent on other factors when it comes to preparedness measures, they are equally important. It is crucial to understand and, ultimately, implement all four approaches, since local resilience is a function of inclusiveness and flexibility, rather than the effectiveness of a single approach (or measure) (Inderberg et al. 2015; Wamsler and Brink 2014; Wamsler and Pauleit 2016). Inclusiveness refers to the use of not just one or two, but all of the four risk-reducing approaches. Hence, whenever possible, measures that combine two, three or possibly all four approaches within a single activity should be preferred (e.g., in the creation of a climate park; cf., Box 15.1). Flexibility relates to the number and diversity of activities implemented for each approach, which must include both grey and green infrastructure together with socio-economic and political/institutional measures. This is crucial not only to identify multi-purpose solutions, but to also address the root causes of risk and, in turn, achieve sustainable change. Appropriate activities for each approach must be identified for each individual context. Consideration must here be given to: (i) urbanârural linkages; (ii) urban characteristics (i.e., the urban fabric, the environment, economic and governance systems); and (iii) inter-area differences3 (Wamsler, 2014; Wamsler and Brink 2016a). The latter can be characterized in terms of inclusionâexclusion, integrationâ marginalization, wealthâpoverty, equalityâinequality, and formalityâinformality.4 A framework for analyzing urbanârural differences and linkages, and how they relate to weather and non-weather-related hazards is presented in Wamsler (2014) and Wamsler and Brink (2016a). A framework for a systematic vulnerability and capacity assessment that can identify appropriate risk-reduction measures is presented in Wamsler (2014)."
231,161,0.312,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Merja Helena TÃ¶lle, Franciscus Colijn The semi-enclosed North Sea region is one of the biologically richest and most productive regions in the world (Emeis et al. 2015). Its ecosystem comprises a complex interplay between biological, chemical and physical compartments. Humans also play a major role in this system integrating social and economic activities (see Sect. 1.2). As is the case for most marine and coastal ecosystems the North Sea shows a high degree of natural variability, which hampers a distinction between human and natural causes of change. High nutrient loads from terrestrial and anthropogenic sources are one of the major contributors to the high levels of primary production in coastal waters. Fisheries and contaminant inputs constitute the main drivers of change in the North Sea biota. However, complex interactions within the food web make it difï¬cult to discriminate between the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors."

These major changes would destroy the Omo riverine natural resource systemsâeliminating âlast resortâ grazing lands for livestock, flood recession agriculture and ï¬shing habitats throughout the lowermost Omo basin. The impending destruction of indigenous survival systems is heightened by the Ethiopian governmentâs expropriation of tens of thousands of villagers for large-scale, irrigated commercial agricultural enterprises, accompanied by political repression of communities through-out the region. Pastoralists and ï¬shers residing near the western shoreline of Kenyaâs Lake Turkana also face economic collapseâprimarily due to radical lake level drop causing destruction of ï¬sh habitat, lakeside grazing for livestock and potable water. As in the lower Omo basin, these conditions would produce massive scale hunger along with widespread disease. Rapid escalation of armed conflict in the cross-border region would ensue as ethnic groups battle over vanishing food sources."
284,232,0.312,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"The conï¬ict between poverty and sustainable development In Latin America the relationship between poverty, environmental crisis and short-term accumulation in this age of globalization presents a particular complexity. The environmental issue is a fundamental part of the inequality and dependency issue of the development model (MartinezAlier et al., 2010). In search of alternatives, theory can play an important role by showing that we have the resources and capabilities to change the situation. This requires better distribution and organization, which can give us a sustainable and socially just development (Salvia, 2011). Development indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) only highlight the productive face of development and ignore the degradation and waste that it causes. The social destination of production is geared towards those who can manifest themselves in the market, thereby satisfying needs while also generating poverty and misery for those who do not meet the minimum necessary income. The lifetime of products is reduced to avoid market saturation, leading to a signiï¬cant generation of waste and pollution. Therefore, development indicators must be reworked. The development of equity accounts indicates a fruitful path (Sejenovich and Gallo Mendoza, 1997). As a result of this conceptualization, an integrated and sustainable management of natural resources, habitat conservation, and energy and human capacity ï¬nally seems to be possible. It is essential, however, to consider all the negative externalities of state development projects. The production process neither begins with the traditional natural resource (because tasks must be performed in order to regenerate the resource in an integral manner)"
198,150,0.312,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"A stronger focus on results has become common among international development agencies over the last decade. This is also the case for Switzerland and its two development agencies, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC1 (Federal Department of Foreign Affairs) and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO2 (Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research). For SDC and SECO it is important and of great interest to understand what worked and which interventions were effective, which interventions have not produced tangible results and what the reasons for success or failure are. Consequently, Switzerland regularly produces thematic Reports on the Effectiveness of the Swiss International Cooperation. Following effectiveness reports on Water (2008) and on Agriculture (2010),3 the third Report on Effectiveness (2014) was dedicated to Climate Change. Taking stock of results achieved in international cooperation on climate change is a challenging exercise. One has to deal with a mass of information, a broad and highly diverse portfolio and a variety of actors. The consultants had to build on poorly developed methodologies and few internationally recognized standards for measuring climate change adaptation. They were also confronted with the lack of explicit climate baseline data and the difficulties in attributing (and aggregating) the effects of mitigation measures to Swiss interventions. Informing the parliament and the greater public on the results in a synthesized but still relevant manner on the basis of a comprehensive and highly technical report was another demanding task. The main reason for those significant challenges was the fact that the assessment of the International Cooperation portfolio of 423 climate change relevant projects covering the timeframe 2000â2012, was a pioneer undertaking. Switzerland was one of the first bilateral donors commissioning such an assignment. Consequently, this assessment is of specific originality and can be considered as a pioneer venture of a bilateral donor in putting the climate lens on a longstanding development cooperation portfolio. The authorsâ perspective is that of a donor administration. In this chapter the results of the assessment are briefly presented. However, the chapter is mainly focused on the process and presents the lessons of commissioning and conducting the stock taking on 12 years of Swiss International Cooperation on Climate Change. It also presents lessons on how to improve the evaluability of climate change"

Large multinational companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline are also increasing funding for mHealth projects in various parts of the world (Qiang, Yamamichi, Hausman, & Altman, 2011). Droppert and Bennett (2015) described how corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are often tied to broader business objectives of companies and are strategized as an investment for future growth in the region. For example, representatives from pharmaceutical companies reported that their motivations for CSR include building up a country, its population, and its economy to prime the region for future economic expansion, or as a way to do market research which informs their business decisions (Droppert & Bennett, 2015). Health thus is diverted by the state into a new market opportunity for transnational capital, bringing together mobile technologies with health commodities. The state is reworked as an enabler of private capital, ensuring proï¬ts for both the bio and mobile technology industries. While some initiatives are small-scale, informal, community-based, or disease/ treatment-speciï¬c, others are scalable and integrated with formal health systems or telecommunication companies. Many of the initiatives are supported and funded by international organizations and universities. For example, the mCARE program aims to decrease infant mortality in rural Bangladesh by providing expectant mothers with mobile phones. This initiative, which is funded by USAID, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the US Department of Agriculture, allows mothers to inform their health workers once they go into labor so that necessary medical treatment can reach the mother and child in a timely manner (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2012). The interplays of imperial aid agencies, foundations, and the development sectors constitute an overarching framework of health that is fundamentally grounded in the individualization of health. In another example, CycleTel Humsafar, is a free SMS service in India introduced by the Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) at Georgetown University and USAID. This service helps women and their partners with family planning using the âStandard Days Methodâ or the rhythm method. It also includes a family advice component, which is available through Nokia Life, an application only available through Nokia mobile devices. Note here the interplay of the logics of private capital with the agendas of private foundations, global development agencies and the nation-state. Similar to CycleTel, many mHealth applications are the result of publicâprivate partnerships (Schweitzer & Synowiec, 2012; WHO, 2011). In particular, telecommunication companies appear to be leveraging the potential of mHealth to provide health services that are pitched as signiï¬cantly less costly compared to a visit to the doctor. In rural India, the telecommunications company Ericsson has partnered with Apollo Hospitals Groupâs Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation in 2008 on an mHealth initiative that brought medical information and health advice to populations in remote villages and towns (Ericsson, 2008). This initiative was also intended as a way to promote the use of telemedicine through mobile phone applications to these hard-to-reach communities (Ericsson, 2008). In"
72,75,0.312,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"theory â in terms of its implications and usefulness in the analysis of innovation â has been little explored until now.7 Revisiting Tardeâs social theory â which, at its core, is a sociology of innovation â allows a widening of perspective on the nature of social innovation. This goes beyond the economic and technological innovations noted by Schumpeter (1964) and, after him, by the sociology of technology focused either on the social consequences of technology (Ogburn, 1937) or on the âsocial shaping of technologyâ (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985; Williams and SÃ¶rensen, 2002) or âsocial construction of technological systemsâ (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). At the same time, this new focus reveals the blind spots of a narrow economic view. Because Tarde places the laws of the practices of imitation at the centre of his theory of social development, the associated micro foundations of social phenomena provide vital input into an integrative theory of innovation. It enables a discovery of how social phenomena â conditions and constructs â come into being and how they change. The key to this discovery is to analyse the development of social inventions and innovations as well as the associated social practices of their imitation. Unlike Schumpeter, for whom the innovator â namely the âentrepreneurâ â is the focus of interest, Tarde is concerned with the inventions that are understood to be the central driver of social change. For Tarde, these are the many small inventions and ideas, which were difficult or easy to arrive at and mostly went unnoticed at the time of their arising, which therefore are usually almost exclusively inglorious and nameless. (Tarde, 2009b, p. 26) These countless inventions can change society and its practices through multiple acts of imitation, and only as a result of imitation do these inventions become an innovation and a true social phenomenon: âIn the realm of the social, everything takes place as invention and imitation, with imitation forming the rivers and inventions the mountainsâ (ibid, p. 27). For Tarde, imitation is the central mechanism of social reproduction and of social change: All similarities of social origin that belong to the social world are the fruits of some kind of imitation, be it the imitation of customs or fashions through sympathy or obedience, instruction or education, naÃ¯ve or carefully considered imitation. (ibid, p. 38) According to Tarde, imitations always involve variations and simultaneously bring about innovations in social structures and practices."
378,38,0.312,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"Not everyone within the transformation research community works with a transdisciplinary approach and reflexive paradigm. The community combines a wide array of scientiï¬c disciplines and is still sorting out where exactly paradigmatic agreements lie. So within this book I pulled together the work of leading scholars who do at least reject the positivist epistemology and ontology that one ï¬nds in the mainstream economic paradigm and its methodological individualism. In this paradigm, humans do not reflect on more than the costs and beneï¬ts of the choice set with which they are confronted. So each person in their economic system behaves similarly (representative actors), regardless of where they happen to live. This is very convenient because individual behavior assumptions are aggregated into extrapolations of how the system will work as a whole and what knock-on effects it will haveâe.g., the prediction that markets will balance themselves. However, even within allegedly objective, positivist/standard economics, it has been recognized that such additive approaches risk a fallacy of aggregation, ending in incorrect predictions. For example, American economist Alfred E. Kahn warned of The Tyranny of Small Decisions as early as 1966. He stressed that market equilibrium theory must remain cautious about the reliability of its methodological individualism: small decisions by rationally calculating actors may well lead to misallocation effects on the macro scale that produce outcomes which the same individuals would not choose (Kahn 1966: 23). One prime example of this tyrannical effect in natural sciences is the way that climate change results from the cumulative effect of what seem to be negligibly small entities of additional CO2 emissions made on the individual scale."

For example, efforts to understand the reality of how legal, institutional and policy frameworks can mediate the translation of ecosystem services to benefits (see Chaps. 2 and 4) were driven in large part by stakeholders identifying key issues of interest during the early stages of the research. A highly structured approach was accordingly adopted to ensure the ability to respond to stakeholder priorities and knowledge and ensure that stakeholder expectation of findings were realistic. In addition to the manifest need to match stakeholder needs with research capacity, the views of stakeholders are also integral to the scenario development process described in Chap. 9. This chapter describes the stakeholder engagement process as well as the first two stages of the four-stage scenario development process (see Fig. 10.1), identification of key issues and development of scenario narratives."

341,151,0.312,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"early twentieth centuries made tutored use of water services a moral obligation. It is surely no coincidence that in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the major technological means to organise and deliver such an ambitious agenda also appeared â necessity, as so often, was the mother of invention. Joseph Bazalgette began his âgreat interceptor sewerâ project in 1859, an iconic project that required a new politics of water services as well as new technologies and new ways of organising capital investment (Halliday 2001). Perfection of slow sand filtration, adoption of chlorine as a purifying additive to drinking water, the proliferation of reservoirs (often underwritten by Acts of Parliament) and the emergence of limited liability companies as the key commercial vehicles for commercial organisation all came about in the second half of the nineteenth century. This hydrosocial contract was however not completed until the passage of the 1945 Water Act which mandated consolidation, and part-nationalisation, of Britainâs water services system. The second phase, âhydromodernismâ, was characterised by an almost messianic belief in water technologies (especially dams and big engineering works) and the ultimate responsibility of government to provide mass water services. Water services were seen predominantly as functions of large public bureaucracies operating at the urban or regional scales. This hydrosocial contract prevailed well into the 1980s and early 1990s before it was decisively challenged by a new urban hydropolitics, based on a burgeoning distrust of both the technocentrism and the public authority premises upon which hydromodernism rested (at least in Britain). Indeed the shift away from ecological modernism towards a more biocentric value system meant that water services increasingly had to take account of the needs of the natural environment. This new sensitivity to the environmental dimension of water services has emerged at nearly the same moment as the prevailing faith in government as an efficient service provider has faltered. After 1992 a new hydrosocial contract, integrated water resource management (IWRM), was articulated based on the neoliberal view that environmental and social outcomes could be achieved more efficiently by private providers. In the UK, water services governance underwent a marked transformation just before 1992 as water services companies were privatised in 1989 and the state role recast as one of providing strong economic, quality assurance and environmental regulation of privatised local water services monopolies (Bakker 2003; Staddon 2010). Jamie Linton (2010) points out that this current hydrosocial contract reframes peoplesâ relationship with water services in terms of commodification and (financial) exchange relations. Even the names of public oversight bodies in the UK, the âConsumer Council for Waterâ and âCustomer Challenge Groupsâ, now reflect the priority given to water services as commercial exchange. The depiction of the UHT in Table 5.1 is not the only way we have sought to visualise this complex geohistorical process. Elsewhere (Staddon and Langberg 2014) we have used an indicator-based approach, presenting such quantitative measures as: â¢ Percentage serviced by piped water supply â¢ Percentage served by wastewater systems â¢ Daily per capita water consumption"
164,321,0.312,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","In response to the growing recognition of the linkages between declining ecosystem services and poverty, conservation organizations and development agencies have been designing and implementing initiatives that focus on maintaining ecosystem services. Although the concept of ecosystem services provides a new platform for the challenge of aligning conservation with development objectives through common links to human well-being, the success of on the ground efforts has been limited. This is due partly to the perception among practitioners that it is difficult to integrate these objectives consistently, as well as some skepticism within the environmental community of the application of an ecosystem services-based approach to conservation (Tallis et al. 2009). Furthermore the availability of robust empirical studies on the nexus between poverty and the environment is limited, particularly due to difficulties in obtaining relevant data from developing countries (Dasgupta et al. 2005). In the following sections we have highlighted reported examples of the dependence on ecosystem services by people living under extreme poverty from countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa in order to contribute to awareness of ecosystem management efforts and poverty alleviation. The information on the links between ecosystem services and poverty alleviation summarized in the following sections is drawn from studies undertaken by the Consortium on Ecosystems and Poverty Alleviation (CEPSA) in South Asia (ESPASSA 2008) and Sub-Saharan Africa (Shackleton et al. 2008). The South Asia effort focused on India and the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region including: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan. South Asia is home to almost one-quarter of the worldâs population, and has experienced intensive development processes that in many cases have led to severe environmental degradation. The Sub-Saharan Africa component of the study includes eight case studies with in-depth analyses and local information from arid and semi-arid areas of: Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe (Shackleton et al. 2008). In arid and semi-arid lands peopleâs dependence on ecosystem services is often high due to limited alternative livelihood options, the fragile nature of these ecosystems, and relatively high risk involved in achieving livelihood objectives (MA 2005b). A brief summary of the links between different types of ecosystem services and poverty based on these studies is provided below."
299,498,0.312,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"One major place where the study of bioethics and social justice converge is in examining the normative criteria according to which scarce resources are allocated. For instance, when triage takes place, rationing is called for, and the argument is advanced that after a certain age, senior citizens should be granted only ameliorative care. Here the focus is on questions raised in the United States, as well as in several other countries in the wake of the 2008â2009 great recession, by fears that the economy will continue to grow slowly and suffer from high levels of debt and a high rate of unemployment. Various public efforts were launched to reduce public outlays in general and those set aside for Medicare and Medicaid in particular. Indeed, it was argued that because âentitlementsâ command about 60% of the federal budget, and given that a good part of the remaining 40% is dedicated to defense and interest that must be paid, unless entitlementsâand especially Medicaid and Medicareâwere cut, it would be impossible for the United States to âput its fiscal house in order.â Both legislators and media mavens argued that cutting into the social safety net was not merely necessary to reduce the deficit, but that it was mathematically inevitable. As Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) put it, âWe canât solve our budget crisis without dealing with our entitlementsâ (NPR 2010). The âinevitableâ need to cut into social safety nets is inevitable only if one refuses to collect additional revenues, such as through a carbon emissions tax, capand-trade system, or value-added tax. To give but one example, a carbon emissions tax of $10 per ton of carbon content could generate $50 billion a year and generate several other desirable outcomes. Whether or not one agrees with such revenue generating moves, they demonstrate that cutting entitlements is a matter of choice, not a mathematical necessity. The normative case for social safety nets is often made on social justice grounds. These programs have lifted millions of Americans out of poverty, more than all other federal programs combined, and they transfer a modest amount of resources from more affluent Americans to those less endowed. They are also defended on social contract grounds. Senior citizens and those late in their careers have planned their whole lives around the assumption that the safety nets they paid into would be there when they retired or became infirm. To violate this contract is manifestly unfair. There is another moral argument to consider. If we must make cuts, we ought to first cut those budget items that in effect pay for harmful activities and then those without any discernable social benefits, before we even consider touching those that are beneficialâeven if the benefits are limited and their costs are high. This is a sociological version of the medieval medical aphorism: first, do no harm."

382,19,0.312,"A History of Male Psychological Disorders in Britain, 1945â1980","medical services should have a limited role in health.59 Much of McKeownâs thesis was ultimately discredited, but, nonetheless, the notion that social conditions and standards of living ultimately impact on health remains a relevant one. The remit of this book is not to evaluate the relative merits of either approach; indeed, most would now view targeted intervention and social change as complementary to each other.60 However, the following chapters serve to illustrate how a post-war medical model that emphasised a curative, interventionist approach did much to impede the detection of male psychological and psychosomatic illness. Had the medical model focused additionally upon health issues in political, social and economic terms, it might contrastingly have provided the ideological motivation for explanations of the social causation of disease and consideration of the cultural construction of gendered behaviour that is so intimately connected with mental disorders. A more holistic approach might further have inspired changes in medical education towards the organised study of social pathology which, as Ryle proposed in 1947, might âgive a broader and more humanistic outlook to emerging doctors and fit them better for their important role in a changing societyâ.61 As this book will suggest, the longstanding cultural association with women and mental illness further exacerbated cliniciansâ propensity to diagnose psychological disorders more readily in women than in men. One of the central arguments presented in this book is that, for a variety of reasons, many of which are not completely understood, men have tended to present with distress in ways that fit less well with the traditional medical models of mental illness. Instead of presenting with classically dysthymic symptoms of low mood, for example, men have been more likely to report physical symptoms affecting the body and musculoskeletal system. I build on this argument throughout the following chapters and contend that it is one of the most fundamental reasons why men do not appear in data for psychological illness as regularly as women. Any discussion of psychosomatic symptoms must necessarily engage with the growing literature on somatisation â a topic that has been widely debated between psychiatrists and anthropologists since the mid-1950s.62 In 1977, the American psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman wrote a seminal article criticising psychiatryâs âbreathless searchâ for a universal form of depression across cultures.63 While acknowledging that there may well be a basic depressive syndrome characterised by depressive affect, insomnia, weight loss and other mood changes, Kleinman argued that this syndrome ârepresents a small"

179,1041,0.312,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 1: Water Quality, Sediments, Sediment Contaminants, Oil and Gas Seeps, Coastal Habitats, Offshore Plankton and Benthos, and Shellfish","Coastal habitats, such as beaches, salt marshes, and mangroves, can experience severe alteration from hurricanes and other tropical storms. Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall in Florida and Louisiana in late August 1992, removed sections of salt marsh and deposited them in shallow ponds and bays (Cahoon 2006). Hurricane Katrina similarly impacted brackish marshes east of the Mississippi River resulting in more than 80 ha (200 acres) of land loss (Morton and Barras 2011). Sediment and wrack deposition during hurricanes can bury marsh vegetation and result in plant mortality (Guntenspergen et al. 1995; Valiela and Rietsma 1995). Also, saltwater intrusion in lower salinity coastal marshes disrupts system ecology, resulting in short-term vegetation dieback (Cahoon 2006). In contrast to the negative effects of hurricanes and storms, hurricane-generated sediment input can counterbalance relative sea-level rise and promote wetland sustainability (McKee and Cherry 2009). In addition, bare patches resulting from wrack deposition allow for the recruitment of other plant species, generating habitat heterogeneity and increasing plant diversity (Guntenspergen et al. 1995). Mangrove forests in Florida have been periodically disturbed by hurricanes, such as Hurricane Donna in 1960 (Craighead and Gilbert 1962), Hurricane Andrew in 1992 (Smith et al. 1994; Baldwin et al. 1995), and Hurricane Wilma in 2006 (Whelan et al. 2009). These and other studies have documented the impacts of such storms on subsequent structure and function of mangrove forests, including defoliation and losses of branches or entire trees (Davis 1995; Baldwin et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2004; Milbrandt et al. 2006; Profitt et al. 2006; Ward et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009; Whelan et al. 2009; Castaneda-Moya et al. 2010; Harris et al. 2010). Recovery of mangroves after hurricane disturbance is a function of a complex interaction of factors, including seedling recruitment and survival, resprouting capability, and colonization by herbaceous vegetation (Baldwin et al. 2001). Post-disturbance site productivity (Ross et al. 2006) and spatial variation in hurricane impact (Thaxton et al. 2007) further influence regeneration success. Recovery of ecological structure generally occurs, but it is a relatively slow process compared to herbaceous systems. Hurricane damage to seagrass beds can be highly variable and depends on location as well as hurricane characteristics (Smith et al. 1994; Courtemanche et al. 1999; Paerl et al. 2001; Coles and Brown 2007; CebriaÌn et al. 2008; Anton et al. 2009). Hurricanes have been observed to cause widespread damage to seagrasses, but also to pass with little or no damage (Poiner et al. 1989; Hemminga and Duarte 2000). For example, a cyclone and its associated rainfall caused a loss of approximately 1,000 km2 (247,000 ac) of seagrass in Hervey Bay, Australia (Preen et al. 1995). Other reports have shown hurricanes having only small impacts on seagrass beds and associated macrophytes (Fourqurean and Rutten 2004; Tilmant et al. 1994). Hurricane Katrina was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history, with winds over 264 km/h (164 mi/h) and a storm surge of 7.8 to 8.5 m (25.6 to 27.9 ft) in the western coast of Mississippi (Hsu et al. 2005). Anton et al. (2009) showed that this powerful hurricane had no major impact on seagrass density, biomass, or community structure (abundance of producers and consumers) in a seagrass bed located approximately 100 km (62 mi) to the east of the hurricaneâs landfall. Overall, this research showed that natural temporal changes in seagrass metabolism, recorded before the hurricane, were larger than any post-storm changes. Conversely, a combination of tropical storm activity and higher-than-average watershed discharge in the Big Bend area of Florida is believed to have caused severe reductions in seagrass distribution and abundance up to 2005; absence of storm activity and relatively low river"
222,319,0.312,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"11.1 Introduction The combination of a highly variable climate, a large and increasing population and a high reliance on water dependent sectors such as agriculture means that South Asia could be particularly at risk to future climate change and variability. Changes in the climate occur in a variety of ways, including changes in mean temperature, changes in extreme daily maximum temperatures and changes in the length, frequency or magnitude of heatwaves. Similarly, increases or decreases in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation could affect water availability or change the characteristics of floods or droughts. For a monsoon climate, such as South Asia, changes in seasonality could also have a large impact on the quantities and timings of water availability, a critical factor in agrarian societies. Climate change and variability is therefore a key underpinning input into many of the biophysical models which form part of this research. The focus in this chapter is on climate projections J.

38,137,0.312,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Scenarios are stories about plausible futures, with the power to capture public attention and inform more sustainable decisions (Henrichs et al. 2010). They can help communicate the outcomes of different choices for societies and ecosystems while at the same time involving stakeholders in a powerful learning process. It is important to consider the explicit goals for the use of scenarios in determining which type of scenario will best address those goals and reach their intended audience. Three main uses of scenarios include: (1) assessing the impact of decisions under consideration, (2) exploring hypothetical but plausible futures, and (3) building consensus around a shared vision for the future (e.g., see IPBES 2016). Certain characteristics can make scenarios more effective. Scenarios that are relevant to the decision context or stakeholder interests will align with the problems and questions of interest to stakeholders. To be legitimate, the scenario development process should include diverse stakeholder views and beliefs. To be credible, scenario storylines should be developed using scientiï¬cally robust methods. To be plausible, scenarios should tell coherent stories that could conceivably happen. Finally, to tell a compelling story, scenarios should be distinct enough from one another that they show contrasting ecosystem service impacts. Iteration of scenarios can greatly enhance many of these characteristics, as they are reï¬ned over time to incorporate stakeholder feedback, as well as emerging knowledge, trends and issues. Translating scenarios to decision-support tools requires that storylines be made spatially-explicit, with each scenario corresponding to a map of land cover, or coastal or marine habitats and uses that feed into the biophysical and/or economic models underlying ecosystem service assessment. Converting scenario storylines into maps can be accomplished by asking stakeholders to simply draw maps for each scenario; more analytical methods of forecasting where change is most likely to occur on the landscape or seascape are based on past trends; rule-based approaches deï¬ne which areas are likely to be most suitable for particular uses or activities. Models of future supply, delivery, value and beneï¬t of ecosystem services into alternative scenarios are increasingly being developed. All the modelling platforms described above may be used to predict ecosystem services under different future scenarios for land/sea use and management patterns. Different models have been built to be differentially sensitive to alternative future issues. For instance, the LPJmL, is highly sensitive to climate change, which is particularly helpful when looking for mid- to long-term effects."

(2016) show that overall, households in areas that experienced lower than average rainfall had lower levels of daily caloric intake as well as food and non-food expenditures, and this effect was most pronounced for the poorest households in the sample. A possible explanation could be that the decline in rainfall had an initial negative impact on agriculture, livestock production and other water-intensive activities. The decline in volume of production thus affected householdsâ purchasing power, forcing them to improve their coping mechanisms. This study also finds strong evidence that cash transfer programmes have a mitigating role against the negative effects of climate shocks. Households that participated in the CGP had much lower negative effects of the weather shock, with poorest households gaining the most. This indicates the potential of social protection to support food access for households exposed to climate risk. However, the analysis also indicates that while participation in the CGP is beneficial in mitigating negative effects of climate shocks on food security, it is not sufficient to fully overcome these effects. Thus it is important to ensure that SCTs are well aligned with other forms of livelihood programmes and climate risk management, including disaster risk reduction activities. This result confirms the findings of authors like Eriksen et al. (2005), who found a positive relationship between the ability of people to draw on extra sources of income and the ability to withstand droughts in Tanzania and Kenya, with respect to those who were not."
197,118,0.312,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"Western European countries have also attracted significant new interest. An exploration of the everyday strategies that are employed by Austrian households in order to alleviate domestic energy deprivation has revealed that âenergy-inefficient windows, buildings and housing sites are the cause of heavy burdensâ (Brunner, Spitzer, & Christanell, 2012, p. 7) for this group. Conceptualizing processes of targeting, identification of households and implementation as three interdependent steps has highlighted the complex errors of inclusion and exclusion implicated in the design of Franceâs rapidly developing fuel poverty policy (Dubois, 2012). The increasing amount of public attention and state funding attracted by the energy poverty predicament in this country has been accompanied by the expansion of scientific research devoted to the issue, especially in terms of the relationship between vulnerability patterns and support policies (Bafoil, Fodor, & le Roux, 2014; Bartl, 2010; Legendre & Ricci, 2015; Ortar, 2016). Several recent contributions indicate that energy poverty is even present in countries like Germany, where rates of social inequality and inefficient housing are at record low levels (Becker, Kouschil, & Naumann, 2014; Billen, 2008; GroÃmann, Schaffrin, & Smigiel, 2016; Kopatz, 2009; MÃ¤rz, 2017; Tews, 2014)."

This deï¬nition of risk, however, represents only one aspect of risk, which is complex in nature. It is described in ISO 31000 [2] that organizations face internal or external factors and influences that make it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on an organizationâs objectives is deï¬ned as ârisk.â The objective of nuclear safety is to protect people, individually and collectively, as well as the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiations [3]. Therefore, the risks of nuclear power plant accidents are the effect of uncertainty in the various predecessors of accidents, e.g., earthquakes, ï¬res, flooding and human errors, etc., on the objective of nuclear safety. Analysis of risk is to attempt to envision what will happen if a certain course of action, including inaction, is taken [4]. Therefore, risk is deï¬ned as an answer to the following questions [4]: â¢ What can go wrong? (Scenario) â¢ How likely is it? (Likelihood) â¢ What might its consequences be? (Consequence) The importance of the scenario, in addition to the consequence and the likelihood (or frequency), is more emphasized in this deï¬nition to describe the characteristics of risk. It is also emphasized that the risk information should include information about what is within/out of scope and how uncertain the result of the risk assessment is. The consequences that are assessed by risk assessment are not limited to fatalities due to radiation exposure, but include other consequences related to quality of life, e.g., environmental damage. It should also be noted that the actual fatalities related to nuclear power plant accidents are not always limited to radiation effects but may include other factors as discussed above, which should be included in the scope of the risk assessment of nuclear power plants."

376,498,0.311,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","causes of transitions between communities and the constraints to recovery of particular communities, including succession, event-driven change, and persistent transitions to alternative stable states (Briske et al. 2003). The causes and constraints to change are often incompletely understood, but they can be tested by monitoring the effects of management and restoration actions. These steps allow managers to link information about plant community composition collected during inventory with concepts of ecosystem dynamics to develop management plans aimed at long-term stewardship. For instance, management actions may seek to maintain a desired plant community with high forage quality, to restore native plants and animals that formerly occupied the site, or to create a mosaic of different plant communities favoring wildlife. In this way, STMs can help specify management objectives for a site, and serve as guides to maintain and restore ecosystem services. The diagrammatic and narrative portions of STMs synthesize various sources of knowledge about ecosystem change, including scientific results, historical anecdotes, and local knowledge. The synthesis is used to develop predictions for how ecosystems respond to natural events and management actions (Bestelmeyer et al. 2009b). Conceptual STMs can be expanded into quantitative models by including estimates of the likelihood of change. Well-developed STMs can serve as a basis for collaborative adaptive management (i.e., management by iterative hypothesis testing, involving multiple stakeholders; Susskind et al. 2012) (Chap. 1, this volume). These guidelines can be updated based on monitoring and new knowledge. In this way, STMs can facilitate a shift from rigid prescriptions based on a one-way relationship between science and management toward a constantly evolving set of recommendations based on collaborative learning and adaptation. Collaborative adaptive management is likely to be more effective than rigid rules of thumb as a basis for environmental stewardship, especially as global climate continues to change. Because of the potential for STMs to link science to management, they are being developed with increasing frequency in rangelands and other ecosystems on several continents (Hobbs and Suding 2009). While some STMs were never intended to be used for management, others were developed as a basis for outreach and decision support. The linkage of STMs to on-the-ground decision-making, however, remains limited for a number of reasons, including a lack of adequate detail and specificity in STMs and the inability of institutions to develop and use STMs. Moreover, it is inherently difficult to determine the likelihood of transitions, especially given time lags and long timeframes needed to observe some transitions. Nonetheless, there is continued optimism that STMs can provide useful tools for bridging the sciencemanagement divide (Knapp et al. 2011b). Our approach in this chapter is to (1) review the ecological basis for STMs, (2) outline the fundamental components of STMs, (3) review the experiences in several countries with the development and use of STMs (Australia, Argentina, the United States, and Mongolia), (4) identify and address challenges to the use of STMs for management, and (5) describe recent technical advances that may improve STMs, including participatory approaches in model construction, the use of STMs within a structured decision-"

Their relation to anthropogenic drivers is unclear. Harmful algal blooms may impact ecosystem function and thus influence economic functions, including human health. However, several species known to cause HABs (e.g. Phaeocystis spp., and several dinoflagellates and raphidophytes) were already present in the North Sea at the beginning of 20th century (Peperzak 2003). Laboratory studies indicate that a rise in temperature may enhance growth, but that not all species tested responded in the same way (Peperzak 2003). 1.6.3.3 Offshore Oil and Gas Vast oil and gas reserves formed during the North Seaâs long geological history are currently being exploited. A large number of oil and gas production platforms widely distributed over the North Sea are responsible for supplying energy to European countries. Waters around the platforms are sometimes contaminated by chemicals including substances that affect benthic communities. Detailed studies showed effects of drilling activities (discharge of oil-based muds) only up to about 1 km from the platform (Daan and Mulder 1996). 1.6.3.4 Renewable Energy As the use of renewable energy from offshore wind farms and from wave/tidal power plants increases, so the threat to seabirds and marine mammals will increase. The long-term impacts of renewable energy infrastructure on the North Sea ecosystem are not yet clear. Initial studies based on a UK wind farm show that plant and animal growth on piles may offer a substantial additional food supply for marine mammals. Studies by Garthe (Kiel University, unpubl.) on telemetered northern gannet Morus bassanus from Helgoland show birds can avoid wind farms to some extent."

Insect outbreaks can be classified into different types based on the population dynamics involved (Berryman et al. 1987): (A) Regularly cyclic outbreaks: in northern Europe the Geometrid moths (Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata) that defoliate mountain birches belong to this type (Haukioja et al. 1988). (B) Eruptive outbreaks occur at irregular intervals. They may be triggered by specific environmental conditions (e.g. drought) and individual outbreaks are short. Pine sawflies (Neodiprion sertifer, Diprion pini) exemplify this type (Hanski 1987; Juutinen 1967). Another pest that has eruptive outbreaks is the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus), which is mainly regulated by resource availability (Ãkland and BjÃ¸rnstad 2006). (C) Sustained outbreaks that may last for several years also occur at irregular intervals and they are triggered by environmental conditions. Although these kinds of outbreaks are rare in northern Europe, a recent example can be found in the damage caused by the large web-spinning sawfly (Acantholyda posticalis) in Finland and in Estonia (Pouttu and Silver 2016; Voolma et al. 2009). A common feature to all outbreak types is that there is a difference of several orders of magnitude in insect densities during the low density (endemic) phase versus the outbreak (epidemic) phase (Berryman et al. 1987; Hanski 1987). Thus, the increase phase from endemic to epidemic densities requires normally at least 2 to 4 years, during which the environmental conditions must remain suitable for rapid population growth. The climatic conditions in the boreal zone of northern Europe show high year to year variability. This variability can interact with other factors affecting the population dynamics of forest pest insects (Neuvonen and Virtanen 2015). Recent patterns in the outbreaks of the forest pests in relation to recent climatic changes are reviewed and discussed in this chapter."
198,105,0.311,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"including high-yielding rice and wheat varieties, fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation, has proven to be a powerful instrument of the Green Revolution in fighting hunger in that part of the world. CGIAR currently comprises 15 international agricultural research centers that collectively aim to increase agricultural productivity, reduce poverty and enhance environmental sustainability. Renkow and Byerlee (2010) and Raitzer and Kelly (2008) reviewed evidence of impact across the centers and concluded that there have been strong positive impacts of CGIAR research relative to investment. Another way to describe CGIARâs success is to show a world without it (Evenson and Gollin 2003): focusing on the impact of crop improvement research from 1965 to 1998 provided counterfactual scenarios of the global food system: developing countries would produce 7â8 % less food; their cultivated area would be 11â13 million hectares greater at the expense of primary forests and other fragile environments; and 13â15 million more children would be malnourished. However, agricultural R4D has not realized its full potential: the world food system continues to face challenges of persistent food insecurity and rural poverty in many parts of the developing world. The adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices by farmers has often been less than expected, when considering their demonstrated benefits, primarily due to a supply-led approach to their development and dissemination, with limited attention paid to context specificity, to farmerâs priorities beyond increased agricultural productivity, and to the socio-economic, political and institutional contexts within which smallholder farmers operate. Many studies have shown that âscientifically provenâ technologies alone are not the only key to get to impact. If a technology gets adopted or adapted, it is often not so much because of its quality and suitability but because of good social management and implementation processes (Hartmann and Linn 2008; Pachico and Fujisaka 2004). New challenges like population growth and climate change are adding complexity to the mission of CGIAR and other R4D organizations. Within this context, this chapter aims to describe the journey towards a new R4D approach based on theory of change (TOC) and impact pathway thinking for program implementation, monitoring, learning and evaluation (MEL). It illustrates lessons of broad applicability regarding results-based management (RBM) and adaptive management approach to tackling complex development challenges through R4D. The key messages are summarized in Box 4.1. The chapter starts by describing a case study within CGIAR, where TOC combined with IPs and learning-based approaches were employed to build an outcome-focused RBM approach to R4D. It then analyses the main findings, focusing on program design and systems for planning and reporting, as well as a MEL framework within an impact pathways approach. The chapter concludes with lessons for required institutional change as well as for MEL practitioners, researchers and policy makers."

For example, during the low flow periods the two major direct uses of the river waters (water supply and pollutant carrier) are in conflict with each other and results in critical water stressed situations due to the inadequate quantity and poor quality. Over 89 % of the respondents from all DSDs view their resource uses are threatened or are in conflict situation at present. Ninety one percent of stakeholders believe their resource uses to be threatened in the near future under the assumption that no change will take place in the river system. The stakeholders were requested to identify the user sectors, which have created conflict situations with other uses or are already threatened by other use sectors. Three resource use sectors emerged as being principally responsible for negatively impacting the other resource users. Sand mining is identified by a large majority 60 % (180) as the single resource use sector which impacts the other users (Fig. 9.7). This was followed by clay mining on river banks and dumping waste which were identified by 17 % (51) and 13 % (40) respectively. Interestingly, all of the above three sectors have a direct relationship to the urbanisation taking place in the surrounding areas. In the first two uses (i.e. Sand and Clay mining industries) the beneficiaries are mostly away from the river basin itself. With the rapid increase in urban construction activities both types of mining have been mechanised during the past two decades resulting in severe negative social and environmental impacts. The unregulated sand mining has increased the depth of the river bed almost 15 m at some places. The most cited direct issues by more than 50 % of the consulted stakeholders are:"

Initial efforts to have stakeholders identify interventions, irrespective of modelling capacity, were unsuccessful as stakeholders defaulted to the policies they already knew and understood. For example, stakeholder recommendations included mainstreaming poverty reduction in all development projects, proper implementation of the national social protection scheme and capacity development of local government. As these could not be analysed in the models, a series of suggestions that could be analysed were subsequently provided to stakeholders in advance of their technical discussions. These proposals included renegotiation of the Farakka Treaty, construction of the Ganges Barrage, changing polder height and other structural interventions to manage flooding and sea-level rise, improved drainage to reduce waterlogging, groundwater use policies, land zoning policies, new potential crops and subsidies for farming. Unfortunately however, this appeared to drive group discussions and frame their proposed interventions, instead of providing indicative suggestions. It remains a challenge to have stakeholders identify interventions that are outside of existing sectoral approaches or beyond research-driven suggestions. It is for this reason that the iterative learning loop and integrated model approach (Fig. 9.1) are particularly valuable, as stakeholders have multiple opportunities to engage. After developing the inputs, they see the modelled results of their sector-driven interventions in terms of broader impacts across ecosystem services and livelihoods. They are then able to propose alternative interventions that are able to respond more directly to the integrated model results considering cross-sectoral impacts. With the application of the integrated model to test specific interventions in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, this process is ongoing. The continuation of this work demonstrates the success of the approach."

Many of these programmes and policies have influenced climate change adaptation planning and implementation within water management settings in the UK and in Somerset. There have been a wide range of research papers and policy white papers in the water sector assessing the climate change impacts on the UK water sector (e.g. Defra 2013; Fenn and Wilby 2011; HM Government 2008, 2011, 2012, 201; Wade et al. 2013). Relatedly, the water industry in the UK has engaged with a range of activities related to climate change forecasting and adaptation plans as part of their water resource management plans (WRMPs are also part of the Water Framework Directiveâ WFDâreporting requirements). Water management in the UK reflects a complex, multilayered and multi-actor regulatory and governance system. Water resources are managed differently across country boundaries in the UK; therefore, the following description applies to England only. Defra (Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs) has the overall responsibility for policy related to the water and sanitation sector (e.g. quality of drinking water and other waters, sewerage treatment and reservoir safety). Defra also ensures that the âlegislative framework for water management is ï¬t-for-purposeâ (Environment Agency 2015a, p. 7). The executive body who has responsibility for environmental regulation (long-term planning for quality, water provision, climate change adaptation, WFD implementation) is the EA. Economic regulation of the water industry falls under OFWAT (Ofï¬ce of Water Services), and monitoring of drinking water quality is covered by the Drinking Water Inspectorate. Natural England (NE) is an executive non-departmental public body responsible to the Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs with a remit to manage and adapt areas of natural signiï¬cance, and to manage green farming schemes in England. In Somerset, Irrigation Drainage Boards (IDBs) oversee district water level management (of the Levels and Moors), and they also work on water level management in order to reduce flood risk to property and people. The IDBs are co-deï¬ned as Risk Management Authorities within the Flood Water and Management Act of 2010 alongside the EA, local authorities and water companies (Association of Drainage Authorities, no date). Defra is responsible for the IDBs; however, they work closely with the EA and lead local flood authorities, and are funded by a range of beneï¬ciaries only one of which is the government. The Somerset Drainage Board Consortium (SDBC) is responsible for managing water levels to protect people, the environment and property (SDBC 2014). The English drinking water and wastewater companies are privatised but are still regulated by, and have reporting responsibilities to, the governmental bodies identiï¬ed aboveâ Defra, EA, OFWAT and the DWI (Water UK 2015). Somerset County Council (SCC) is responsible for managing strategic local services in Somerset. With regards to water management, they have a role to play in emergency planning, consumer protection, town and country planning and local flood management. They also act as âknowledge brokersâ for climate change adaptation awareness raising and other activities.

320,497,0.31,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"dataset and the HABIT-CHANGE-database 2012). Even though models predict a slight increase in precipitation (about 20 mm/day), the number of dry days (<1 mm/day) per vegetation season is expected to increase by 4â5 days. When combining these models the predicted beginning of the vegetation period will shift from 22nd February (1971â2000) to 27th January (2036â2065). Additionally, the predicted water balance, calculated as the mean precipitation minus the potential evapotranspiration, is expected to decrease slightly in autumn. Global-warming-related effects on biodiversity can be mitigated in the short term by designing an appropriate nature reserve (Botkin et al. 2007). However, the challenges of biodiversity loss are daunting, since biodiversity is decreasing even in protected areas. For this reason, alien invasive species found in the Mediterranean, even if not highly invasive, like A. squamatus, might nevertheless potentially become so. In Fig. 19.3 we can recognise the distribution of A. squamatus in areas adjacent to both protected areas of SecÌovlje Salina and SÌkocjanski Inlet. As previously noted, in some years like in 2008 the abundance of A. squamatus increased (GlasnovicÌ and FisÌer PecÌnikar 2010). Our analysis of temperature showed a highly increased mean annual temperature the previous year 2007 (Fig. 19.4), which resulted in a prolonged vegetation period and must have resulted in high seed production as well. To prevent a potential invasion by A. squamatus plants should be removed before reaching the height of 110 cm to prevent or at least minimise seed production, since smaller plants have more than five times fewer flower heads (Fig. 19.2), even though the number of seeds in a single flower head is more or less the same. Calculation show that plants smaller than 110 cm could bear from about 700 to 8,700 seeds, while plants taller than 110 cm produce at least five times more seeds from about 47,000 to 70,000 seeds. Obviously, it is necessary to constrain eventual accumulation of seeds in the soil seed bank and to prevent plants from forming a reservoir for future invasions if appropriate conditions might recur."
260,9,0.31,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"important insights not only into iridovirus replication, but also eukaryotic biology, virus evolution, and hostâvirus interactions. Elucidating the molecular and cellular events of FV3 replication occupied Allan, his co-workers, and others in the USA and Europe from the discovery of FV3 in 1965 until the early 1990s (Murti et al. 1985; Williams 1996). However, despite the molecular insights gained in these studies, investigations of FV3 and other members of the family languished for a variety of reasons. After some initial optimism, it was clear that invertebrate iridoviruses were not suitable, as was baculovirus, as an insect biocontrol agent. Furthermore, FV3 and related vertebrate iridoviruses were initially viewed as minor pathogens, because few outbreaks of ranaviral disease were reported, and those that were, appeared to have minor effects on populations. In addition, unlike LCDV, there was little evidence of infection among ecologically or commercially important fish species. Therefore, even before the recent emphasis on âtranslational research,â iridovirus studies took a backseat to more medically and commercially relevant poxviruses and herpesviruses. However, beginning in the mid-1980s and continuing to the present, this sanguine view of ranaviruses slowly changed, as an increasingly large number of isolates similar to, but not necessarily identical with, FV3 were linked to die-offs of fish, reptiles, and amphibians (frogs, toads, and salamanders) of both ecological and commercial importance (Chinchar et al. 2009). To date, cases of ranavirus infection and disease have been documented on six continents and in at least 175 species of ectothermic vertebrates (Duffus et al. 2015). It is unclear whether the global emergence of ranaviruses is a reflection of their increased virulence or dissemination (via natural or human-related activities) or increased surveillance coupled with better diagnostic and detection mechanisms. Regardless of the reasons, ranaviruses are now viewed as pathogenic agents capable of infecting all classes of ectothermic vertebrates (fish, reptiles, and amphibians) and, depending upon the specific virus, host, and environmental factors, triggering significant morbidity and mortality. The family Iridoviridae currently contains five genera, two of which infect invertebrates (Iridovirus and Chloriridovirus) and three that infect only ectothermic vertebrates (Lymphocystivirus, Megalocytivirus, and Ranavirus; Jancovich et al. 2015a). Lymphocystiviruses and megalocytiviruses only infect fish, whereas, as indicated above, ranaviruses target fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Infection of âhigherâ vertebrates (i.e., birds and mammals) has not been reported. However, this block likely reflects a temperature limit above which the virus cannot replicate (approximately 32 Â°C), and not a lack of suitable cellular receptors, as ranaviruses can replicate in mammalian cell lines (e.g., baby hamster kidney) when incubated at 30 Â°C. Ranaviruses also cause apoptotic cell death in mammals even if the pathogen has been inactivated by heat or radiation (Grayfer et al. 2015). Thus, ranaviruses represent a group of pathogens that possesses a wide host range and the potential to affect diverse populations of vertebrate species around the globe. The question frequently arises, âAre ranaviruses a significant threat to wildlife?â We believe the answer is, âYes,â but that the seriousness of the threat is dependent"
224,179,0.31,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"GLUES mathematically resolves the dynamics of population density and three population-averaged characteristic sociocultural traits: technology (TA ), share of agropastoral activities (C), and economic diversity (TB ). These traits are defined for preindustrial societies as follows: 1. Technology (TA ) is a trait that describes the efficiency of food procurementâ related to both foraging and farmingâand improvements in health care. In particular, technology as a model describes the availability of tools, weapons, and transport or storage facilities. It aggregates over various relevant characteristics of early societies and also represents social aspects related to work organisation and knowledge management. It quantifies improved efficiency of subsistence, which is often connected to social and technological modifications that run in parallel. An example of (TA ) is the technical and societal skill of writing as a means for cultural storage and administration, with the latter acting as organisational lubricant for food procurement and its optimal allocation in space and among social groups. (TA ) is labour-dependent. 2. A second model variable, C, represents the share of farming and herding activities, encompassing both animal husbandry and plant cultivation. It describes the allocation of energy, time, or manpower to agropastoralism with respect to the total food sector. 3. Economic diversity (TB ) resolves the number of different agropastoral economies available to a regional population. This trait is in the full model closely tied to regional vegetation resources and climate constraints; in this reduced model, it denotes a labour-independent technology. A larger economic diversity offering different niches for agricultural or pastoral practices enhances the reliability of subsistence and the efficacy in exploiting heterogeneous landscapes. The temporal change of each of these characteristic traits follows the direction of increased benefit for success (i.e., growth) of its associated population (Appendix Eq. 6.1).; this concept had been derived for genetic traits in the works of Fisher (1930) and was recently more stringently formulated by Metz and colleagues (Kisdi and Geritz 2010; Metz et al. 1992) as adaptive dynamics (AD). In AD, the populationaveraged value of a trait changes at a rate that is proportional to the gradient of the fitness function evaluated at the mean trait value. The AD approach was extended to functional traits of ecological communities (Merico et al. 2009; Wirtz and Eckhardt 1996) and was first applied to cultural traits of human communities by Wirtz and Lemmen (2003). The adaptive coevolution of the food production system {TA , TB , C} and population P (Appendix Eqs. 6.1â6.4), which is at the heart of this modelâs implementation, was also found empirically by Boserup (1981, p. 15): âThe close relationship which exists today between population density and food production system is the result of two long-existing processes of adaptation. On the one hand, population density has adapted to the natural conditions for food production [. . .]; on the other hand, food supply systems have adapted to changes in population density.â"

The Global South is both experiencing phenomenal development in some places (with the attendant environmental and social challenges) and still facing deep poverty and hunger. Some of this is, in turn, partly but never exclusively related to socio-demographic changes, including ageing societies virtually everywhere around the world, and increases in lone-parent families (ILO, 2011). Global population flows, whether from the Global South northward or within the European Union from poorer to richer member states (whether from east to west or north to south), are also creating new wealth for some and precariousness, poverty and even misery for others (Dustmann and Frattini, 2011). Historically marginalised groups facing prejudice â Aboriginal peoples in many countries and Roma almost everywhere they live â find their lives increasingly difficult (UN, 2009; European Commission, 2011a). Many of these changes can be summarised under the label of ânew social risksâ (Bonoli and Natali, 2012). The structure of these new risks challenges previous configurations of the welfare diamond and associated social policy programmes, practices and ideas about the proper and possible balance of spaces for markets, states, families and communities. In effect, the market corner of the welfare diamond is being exhorted by social policy communities to expand, by recognising the contributions of â and contributing towards â the social economy and social entrepreneurship more generally. But often practices of social innovation also include reworking both the responsibilities of the community corner of the diamond and aligning it in ground-breaking ways with respect to the market. As it does so, social innovationâs status as a quasi-concept is very clear. Numerous ways of understanding it co-exist as markets are re-imagined."

365,595,0.31,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"This chapter focuses on how smallholder adaptation to changing conditions under climate change might be affected by government risk management interventions. While Mendelsohn (2010) finds that farmers without insurance have a strong incentive to adapt to climate change, Skees et al. (1999) show that the assumption of risk by farmers may stymie farmer investment in certain adaptation strategies. Collier et al. (2009) underscore the importance of specific policy design features in impacting behaviour. For example, traditional agricultural insurance (which makes an indemnity payment when the farm incurs a verifiable production loss) can help to manage production risk but may diminish incentives to adapt to climate change. Conversely, area-yield insurance and weather index insurance (as we examine in this chapter) approaches can minimize these moral hazard concerns since indemnities are paid independently of the actual loss incurred by a policyholder. Of course, all risk management policies will change the framework under which farmers make production decisions. Deepening our understanding of how institutional policies impact farmer decisions under climate change is of critical importance for welldesigned climate adaptation strategies now and in the future. The following questions anchor our analyses as we build on previous work examining risk management under climate change (Collier et al. 2009; Heltberg et al. 2009, Anton et al. 2013). 1. Can policy makers assist in risk management without steering farmers away from beneficial adaptation? 2. How do insurance and information programs impact farmer behaviours and might these two policy approaches interact in their effects on farmer decisions? 3. How can policy makers decide between interventions when the information about how various instruments would perform under an increasingly variable climate is very limited? The contribution of this chapter is to address â in the context of smallholder agriculture in Malawi â the risk and the uncertainties introduced by climate change and the role of perceptions regarding this uncertainty in shaping farmer decisions and the appropriate risk management instruments to improve smallholder welfare."
78,104,0.31,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"There can be no doubt that the information and communication technologies (ICT) deeply impact the human society. The difficulty in appraising their effect and anticipating the concomitant changes lies in the depth of that impact. In an attempt to understand the present evolutions, we propose to uncover the underlying structure of this new world by revisiting its dependencies on the hyper-connectivity on which it is grounded, and the consequences of this hyper-connectivity, in modifying profoundly the network of inter-individual relations. Where we used to have ten to fifty close friends living near us, with whom we shared convivial relations, we may now have hundreds of acquaintances living on other continents, with whom we currently exchange specialized information about our main fields of interest that can be professional, artistic or related to any kind of hobby. It naturally follows from these major changes in the scale and nature of individual relationships, that the social fabric is dramatically evolving. Therefore, to quote Aristotle, since âman is by nature a social animal,â humanity is changing because society is changing. But, how are humans and society changing? And, what does it mean to be human, in this new society? These are the questions we would like to address. Besides, the hyper-connected world is also a world of hyper-memorisability, where all the information is stored in huge databases and accessible anytime from anywhere, without any oblivion. And, it is a world of hyper-reproducibility and hyper-diffusibility, where all the knowledge, and more generally, all the works of the mind, i.e. all the music, all the paintings, all the movies, etc. can be freely and massively reproduced and diffused. So, both the way in which individuals access knowledge and their internal memories are deeply modified, which transforms human cognitive abilities."

We might have witnessed a breathtaking, nationwide, coordinated emergence of individual human resources via a grassroots crisis management movement. In other words, a peopleâs crisis management made possible and brought into being through a vastly different kind of communication from Government and nuclear industry leaders: unrelenting truthfulness via transparency and comprehensibility."
77,185,0.31,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Cultural (Health) Capital Theory Recent theoretical developments have aimed to underline the structural dimension of health and health care habits. A central element is the conceptualization of social position. Scholars have argued that in current post-industrial societies, stratification is not driven by social class alone (Clark and Lipset 2001). As a result of better labor conditions, increasing wages, and disposable time, consumption patterns have gained importance (Bogenhold 2001). Therefore, the explicit inclusion of cultural capital in explanatory approaches to social inequality in health and health behavior has been advocated, rather than deducing it from general measurements of socioeconomic status (SES), such as social class and income (Abel 2008; Abel and Frohlich 2012; Shim 2010). Bourdieu (1986) described how inequality could be reproduced by the interplay of three different forms of capital: economic, social, and cultural. He further identified three different forms of cultural capital: objectivized (e.g. books, artefacts, paintings), institutionalized (e.g. education, job title) and the embodied state incorporating mind and body (e.g. values, skills, knowledge). When applying Bourdieuâs (1986) general notion of cultural capital to health and health care research, what is termed cultural health capital can be defined as comprising âall culture-based resources that are available to people for acting in favour of their health. In its incorporated form it comprises health-related values, behavioural norms, knowledge and operational skillsâ (Abel 2008, p. 2). This form of cultural capital becomes directly relevant to health through the adoption of healthy lifestyles, such as engaging in preventive care (Abel 2008; Abel and Frohlich 2012; Phelan et al. 2004; Shim 2010). Analogous to life course research, a longer view of an individualâs life is taken when elaborating on how cultural health capital develops. It has been argued that the health-relevant knowledge and skills used to lead healthy lives start accumulating in childhood and this proceeds over the life course through repeated contacts with health care providers and lifelong socialization (Abel and Frohlich 2012; Mirowsky and Ross 2003; Shim 2010). Cultural health capital theory highlights that peopleâs behavioral options and preferences are structurally constrained and unequally distributed between social groups (Abel 2008)."

However in practice, reducing the geographic scale of the index too much leads to issues related to moral hazard, i.e. the fear that households may become able to manipulate the index. Finally, for products which do not aim to cover all types of shocks (such as insurance products based on a rainfall index), an additional source of low quality arise from uncovered covariate risks (e.g., locusts, tsunamis). This type of error is related to the traditional distinction between single-peril and multiple-peril insurance products, but the difference is not as clear in the case of index insurance: satellite-based products such as IBLI, for instance, are supposed to cover all types of shocks related to lack of forage- including increase in livestock diseases- but cannot detect shocks which are not related to the ground vegetation- such as a new epidemic affecting well-fed livestock. These uncovered covariate risks further decrease the quality of the protection offered to poor households. Of course, households may be still interested in affordable index insurance products which only protects from one type of shock (e.g. drought), but the overall protection provided by this type of product has to be carefully analyzed and put in perspective with the price of the product and the probability that a farmer is made worse off with the insurance than without it.12 The lack of a strong negative correlation between the insurance indemnities and income shocks due to yield losses will result in a low demand for the insurance product (Clarke 2016; Smith and Watts 2009). Low correlation will not only fail to protect farmers, but eventually seriously damage livelihoods, because poor households pay high premiums to purchase protection, and plan on being protected when making investment decisions. Thus, a detailed analysis of the sources of errors needs to be conducted before implementing an index-based insurance and after its implementation, in order to rule out low quality products and pave the road for future product improvements. While this type of analysis is rarely undertaken in practice, IBLI is one of the most studied index insurance programs, and its quality has been closely scrutinized before and after implementation."

169,832,0.31,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The VTT proudly boasts of a change in attitudes, even a paradigm shift. And indeed, the focus is moved from defence (and a military-like organisation) to regulation, control and prevention, and a long-term sustainable solution with ecological considerations in mind. The most important change in the approach was the idea of retaining water instead of draining it from the plains, which could be one step toward integrating ideas of ï¬ood and drought management. However, as conceived, such a technical solution does not really reï¬ect the kind of paradigm shift the name suggests. The published program still states that the key objective was to enhance ï¬ood security in the Tisza valley, and not the implementation of integration of land management and development practices. Such integrative, alternative practices disarm ï¬oods by lowering crest elevation and velocity, and then use their storage to lower drought risk. This renders the very concept of risk, danger and exposure to ï¬oods irrelevant. Instead, there are three major segments in the program, of which only the second one is a relatively new idea; the other two are business as usual methods: 1. Improvement of the water carrying capacity in the high water stage river bed on the Tisza (in other words: clear the ï¬oodway) 2. Construction of a ï¬ood detention emergency reservoir system with a total storage capacity of 1.5 billion m3 (10â12 reservoirs) 3. Development of the existing ï¬ood control works and structures. Later, the VTT concept was broadened to involve infrastructure development in the settlements concerned (excess water drainage in the built-up areas, sewage systems, waste water treatment plants, replacement and construction of byroads, bicycle paths) and implementation of husbandry methods driven by natural conditions (landscape management). Yet the actual solutions treat only the symptoms. For instance, as part of the ï¬ood control measures, the bank protection works at the bottleneck in Kisar were reinforced, but nothing was done to overcome the bottleneck itself. Cost cuts and funding difï¬culties resulted in mistranslation and piecemeal implementation of the original concept. As an incomplete and imperfect edition of the complex system of water storage bodies originally intended by the VTT, these current reservoirs are now prone to functional inaptitude. The ï¬rst structure to be inaugurated was the CigÃ¡nd reservoir in the BodrogkÃ¶z in 2008. The second structure, the Tiszaroff reservoir, was completed in 2009 with the expectation that it will be used only once every 30 or 40 years. Conceived as an infrequently used âemergency reservoirâ, it obviously would not make society and ecosystems adaptive to the mounting pressures of increasing climatic variability. Additionally, the poor design of both structures does not follow the natural depressions of the ï¬oodplain. Today, 6 of the 11 reservoirs are operational, and in the period between 2014 and 2020, an additional 50 billion euros worth of European Union funding is earmarked for the completion of the series of projects (MTI 2015). This expensive system partially addresses only one problem: ï¬oods. It does not help with waterlogging or drought. Also, as it turned out, it is of not much use in the case of icy ï¬oods, striking last time in February 2017 (VG/MTI 2017)."

170,326,0.31,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4 On Affect: A Prelude to Cybersex as Affective Labour The utility of affect is significant for its theoretical and practical reconsideration of the neoliberal subject (Paasonen 2011), giving expression to âa new configuration of bodies, technology, and matterâ (Clough and Halley 2007: p. 2). Central to theoretical perspectives on affect is âthe capacity to affect and to be affectedâ, which stems from Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinozaâs philosophy of ethics (Clough and Halley 2007; Clough 2010). This is the underlying logic that compels the moment preceding emotions and psychological states towards movement and action. Affect is not limited to feeling states; it encompasses forms of energies and forces that emanate from the body (Brennan 2004), as well as the bodyâs potentiality, capacities and consequences (Clough et al. 2007; Clough 2010). Approaches to affect are related but differ in their emphases and concerns (Seigworth and Gregg 2010), and we draw on three of these iterations. The first approach, drawing on thermodynamics, cybernetics and information theory, construes the individual as an organism whose affective capacities enable not only rational thought and action (Clough and Halley 2007) but also irrational, sometimes inconsequential states. Affect is a reservoir of potential matter and energy for determined and unintended actions, and often emerge as intensities (Hayles 1999; Hansen 2006; Massumi 2002; Clough and Halley 2007; Clough 2010; Gregg and Seigworth 2010). It also carries political possibilities or individual capacities for selforganizationâwhat may be referred to as âautopoiesisâ (Massumi 2002; Clough and Halley 2007). However, in an era of âintensified financializationâ, the productivity of affect is a constant struggle between its autonomy and commodification (Clough 2010: p. 219), bound up with forms of neoliberal biopolitics and the regulation of populations. Biopolitics here is defined as âthe extension of an economic rationality to all aspects of society, including life-itselfâ (Clough et al. 2007: p. 72)."

However, the researchers warn that the likelihood of reaching climate targets within the scenarios depends as well on a variety of other factors, including future energy demand growth, economic growth and technological innovation. Therefore, securing energy for all within the existing environmental boundaries requires further political measures and ï¬nancial resources. According to Nilsson [14] âInvestment costs for these pathways are large but often proï¬table for society and most of them have already been set in motion. Still, progress is slow and must be accelerated at national and regional levels. Carbon pricing is necessary but not sufï¬cient: beyond this, governance responses need to be put in place to induce transitions through scaling up a diversity of supply and demand options. White and green certiï¬cates, feed-in tariffs, technology standards and removal of fossil subsidies are important ï¬rst steps already under way.

In addition, more effective technologies are required in combination with better scientiï¬c models to assess and predict the distribution and transport of radioisotopes in the environment and ultimately, to understand the transport into and minimize the impact onto the biosphere. The events in Fukushima underscore the necessity for advancements in science and technology and improved communication with the public, and provide a unique opportunity to address both. Currently, local communities and global societies are ill-equipped to prepare for and respond to radiological events and the impact of perceived risks associated with nuclear and radiological incidents. Major releases of radioactivity will have a global impact for two reasons: (1) The radioactive materials can be transported globally quite effectively as has been observed after Chernobyl or Fukushima or previously with nuclear weapons testing; (2) Any event related to the releases of radioactivity will end up as headlines in the global and social media as it is seen as a rare, newsworthy incident, and will beâin most cases inaccuratelyâassociated with a signiï¬cant health impact. Both aspects will cause increased concerns and fear world-wide, which can only be addressed by an enhanced understanding of radiation through improved scientiï¬c literacy and public communication, as well as a better understanding of the associated risk for environmental, biological and health effects. Furthermore, the perceived risk and perceived danger of radiation will continue to hamper public acceptance of nuclear power, which has the potential to contribute to the effort to combat climate change by providing another carbon free energy source necessary to meet the increasing future energy demands while reducing the global CO2 footprint."

The idea was to work with key stakeholders in government and the private sector to identify challenges and possible solutions, based on South Australian law and national and international experience. Solutions for implementation could include legislative (changes to the law), regulatory (changes in the way the law is implemented) and institutional (changes in the governance of water supply and management) aspects. As indicated in Table 6.2, the stakeholders who took part in the study were from a breadth of organisations involved in urban water management, thereby providing a good representation of the South Australian urban water sector. Moreover, they all had significant experience in planning and operating their systems in the face of uncertainties associated with future hydrology, weather, available water supply and projected water demand (which was a main selection criterion for participation). Table 6.4 summarises the major issues and potential solutions for implementing an integrated strategy in Adelaide, South Australia.

118,799,0.309,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"24.4.2 Essential Characteristics of Resilience From a systemic view, resilience is the intrinsic ability of a system to adjust its functioning prior to, during, or following changes and disturbances, so that it can sustain required operations under both expected and unexpected conditions. In contrast to resilience in disaster prevention, the systemic notion of resilience will not distinguish between normal and abnormal system conditions. Resilience engineering is a field that studies technical methodologies to implement resilience into socio-technical systems. While conventional risk management aims at suppressing risks below the allowable limit, risk management in resilience engineering aims at enhancing the ability of a system to suppress performance variability under changes, disturbances, and uncertainties. Resilience, therefore, deals with every system condition: stable operations in normal conditions, prevention of accidents in abnormal conditions, minimization of losses after accidents, and fast recovery from damaged conditions. Woods pointed out that the focus is on assessing the organizationâs adaptive capacity relative to challenges to that capacity and that the following are essential characteristics of resilience [20]. â¢ Buffering capacity: the size or kinds of disruptions the system can absorb or adapt to without a fundamental breakdown in performance or in the systemâs structure;"

This work was echoed in the activities of the Netherlands Centre for Social Innovation 30 years later (see Pot and Vaas, 2008). 4. Diffusion of Social Change: From within sociology, there are analyses of the micro-level structures of innovation and diffusion that affect society â for example, how medical innovations spread across groups of clinicians â that have been classed as social innovation. Henderson (1993) was interested in the relationship between social innovation and political change in terms of diffusion processes. He explored how citizen movements catalyse social innovation â conceptualised as distinct from dominant cultural norms â from fluid positions outside of conventional societal structures. 5. Urban Studies: There is a significant cluster of work within urban studies exploring innovative responses to social exclusion as social innovation under the heading of Integrated Area Development. Much of this work centres on innovation within social relations in urban contexts, and as a body of work, it explores the potential of public, private and civil society models, interventions and interactions.

132,8,0.309,AiREAS: Sustainocracy for a Healthy City: Phase 3: Civilian Participation â Including the Global Health Deal Proposition,"The historic database is kept for interpretation and analysis by both scientists and government ofï¬cials. This infrastructure was the basis for deï¬ning the healthy city project that was to follow and involve 4000 citizens through health and lifestyle research, using the health data for interpretation and communication, together with the database of air pollution. Due to the enormous complexity (medical, technological, social, team effort, interpretation, etc.) of this project, a smaller Proof of Principle, or POP for short, was set up ï¬rst, with just 40 citizens. In Chap. 2, we will go into the details of this process and the interaction we engaged in with the citizens involved. Persuasive interaction with citizens became a challenge on its own. Included in phase 1 (air quality data gathering) was a small budget for communication. We had considered the 3D approach presented by the University of Madrid to show layers of air pollution through a 3D animation over the town. We also looked at integrating light codes into the cityâs streetlight system. But at this stage, it was too far-fetched to consider integrating systems. Instead, we decided to set up a website (http://www.aireas.com) with the intention of getting interaction going with the citizens through this means. This worked to a limited degree at best. A website provides highly informative data for those who look for it. Accessing a website indicates a pre-existing level of interest in the topic covered by the site. In the case of air pollution and health, the people who visit the site still need to make up their own minds about what they see and how they interpret the mix of data without the beneï¬t of specialized knowhow. Little interaction was achieved, even though the site served its informative purpose perfectly, especially for a minority of committed citizens."

Rituals are often associated with seasonal changes and moon cyclesâthese events in nature trigger rituals and myths that contribute to the collective memory of the people and their places. Communities evolve with, and from, these shared landscape memories with traditions and shared values expressed through language, art and architecture, habits and preferences. Collective activities may focus around the local park, schools, places of worship, shopping centres and recreation grounds or increasingly through online spaces. However, competing with this coming together for social interaction, more recent neo-liberal market forces of globalization are fueling the commodiï¬cation of everyday living towards what Foucault (1970) describes as the governmentality of personal agency. The resultant fragmentation of local community building forces in the modern urban settlement can simply just happen with respect for nature being a causality. What we have is an urban ecology in transition from its close connection with nature to technology enabled and sustained built environments. Landscape designers, along with residents and citizens need to imagine new communities, and the affordances of online communications simplify common interest contact. Thirdspace (Oldenburg 1991; Soja 1996) and community networks (Newing 2010) may not have the materiality of past communities.

273,414,0.309,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"various countries are integral part of the overall environment. As a matter of the fact, many of the global environmental problems are often an extension of environmental issues within a certain country. The global problems cannot be solved by an isolated country. We must strengthen cooperation and overall coordination. A number of global issues and common public crisis makes increasingly the necessary of the international cooperation and the common security and common development concept has increasingly become the consensus of statesmen.5 In addition to concern the world rankings in the global environment under the competitiveness on the global environment research, it pays more attention to the achievement on forming the global environmental awareness and promoting the environmental technology, the international cooperation and building of the international environmental institution, which makes the global environmental governance achieving a substantial result. International environmental cooperation should become an important part of national environmental protection. The coordination mechanisms between local governments among different countries are the important safeguards to the comprehensive environmental cooperation standardized and orderly functioning. Every country should adhere to the âCommon but differentiated Responsibilitiesâ principle to promote the development of global environmental governance.6 Especially those of the developing countries are facing shortage of funds, lack of technology, weakness of building capacity and other difficulties in global environmental governance. In this case, they are more badly in need to strengthen international cooperation for global environmental governance. From the perspective of development aid to care the global environmental governance, it is a kind of responsible representation, which includes both political arrangements, but is also conducive to the concept promotion standardization and the trade volume increases."

This process stimulated and informed the development of SVP volunteer management systems largely reï¬ected in an evolving induction process and associated induction pack.3 Over the past ï¬ve years, the SVP has encountered most of the risks identiï¬ed above. At the more alarming and less âlikelyâ end of the spectrum, there have been outbreaks of terrorism and civil disobedience (typically quite isolated and around election periods or involving tribal disputes). Road trafï¬c accidents remain one of the greatest risks to volunteers in all low-resource settings (Gedde et al. 2011: 186). Bhatta et al. (2009) conï¬rm the importance of road trafï¬c accidents as a major cause of volunteer morbidity and mortality. In a survey of VSO volunteers, diarrhoea was the most prevalent heath risk reported (by 79.9%) with highest levels found amongst short stays and younger volunteers. This is followed by skin and dental problems and 17.5% reported some form of road trafï¬c injury. The authors are clear to point out that the response rate to their survey was small (36%) and that this response rate may be skewed in favour of those who had experienced problems (and had something interesting to report). The situation is exacerbated in the Ugandan context by the use of âboda bodasâ (motorcycle taxis) and a study of Peace Corps volunteers in Africa found that 60% of road accidents were related to motorcycle use (Bernard et al. 1989). These risks to individuals also present a risk to the NHS potentially affecting the subsequent safe return of work-ï¬t employees. Exposure to infectious disease presents more direct potential impacts on return and these are risks that the wider public may become aware of and sensitised to.4 Since the commencement of the SVP, Uganda has experienced at least three localised outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever. We have also witnessed several instances of needlestick injury. Both of these were responded to immediately triggering expert advice and a constant iteration of the induction pack. Whilst NHS employers may be interested in the well-being of employees on placement, they are also anxious about the liabilities associated with that and the impact that any local incidents may have on volunteerâs ï¬tness"

These are precisely the type of issues where critical work can open up the âblackboxâ as an aid to deepen understanding, and a stimulus to appropriate actionâ (Walsham and Sahay 2006: p. 13). Brown and Grant (2010) simplify Walsham and Sahayâs (2006) model by summarising it in two broad categories: ICT for development and ICT in developing countries. This categorisation and the survey of 184 articles in peer-reviewed journals conclude that there is an over-representation of research on the âICT in developing countriesâ rather than the âICT for developmentâ category. The authors identify that there is a mismatch between the goals of research questions and the expected goal of impacting development. Is it correct to assess research that is focused on understating technology within developing countries contexts by whether they create or promote more development even if that is not the way it is framed, the authors ask (Brown and Grant 2010). They expose the mismatch between the research questions and the public perception of what ICT4D should achieve. Brown and Grant (2010) thus support Heeksâ (2002, 2007) perspective of a disconnection between ICT4D and development studies from a more theoretical perspective. These classifications, however, do not include a perspective of policy as a vehicle or development or a clear category of work linked to political research questions. Another categorisation is Avgerouâs (2008) proposal that focuses on information systemsâ innovation in developing countries. She analyses the discourses behind ICT innovations in developing countries. She identifies three discourses. The first one assumes that the issue is âcatching upâ, which acknowledges a country divide must be bridged by the adoption of existing technologies from the developed world. A second discourse assumes that the issue is constructing new technologies for the different contexts. This suggests a view that technologies must be embedded in societies. The third discourse is concerned with creating the possibilities for technologies to become significant catalysts for change in the lives of people. One could argue that the first two discourses are related to what Brown and Grant (2010) called âICT in developing countriesâ and the third one is related to what they called âICT for development researchâ. One conclusion that Avgerou (2008) arrives at is that, in this field of research, there is rarely any engagement with macro-political analysis, a required aspect of inquiry especially when discussing the transformative power of ICTs. From the perspective of assessing ICT in development, Heeks (2009) constructs a model that links technologies with development through a chronological categorisation of issues: readiness, availability, uptake, and impact. He calls the first two fociâreadiness and availabilityâICT4D 1.0, the early agenda of infrastructure, digital divide, and supply of services. ICT4D 2.0 includes the other two categories: uptake and impact. He argues that this progression is necessary to reframe the"

At the centre of regional cooperation is the SADC Protocol, without which many of the joint fact-finding and knowledge-building exercises in the regionâs basins may not have been possible. Dramatic changes in South Africaâs political landscape since the early 1990s were initially accompanied by sweeping changes to that nationâs policies, laws and institutions. South Africa became a very active member of SADC, leading processes around issue areas such as devising national water policies, strategies and laws. South Africaâs water reform spurred the wave of reforms experienced in neighbouring countries post-1990 as well. However, like many developing countries, SADC states struggle with implementing many of their well-formed policies, laws and procedures. There are a wide variety of explanations regarding this relatively poor performance: human, financial and technological shortages, âpoor governanceâ embedded in unequal states, tensions around the creation of new sources of authority such as catchment management agencies or councils and water user associations, resource capture facilitated by neoliberal approaches to resource management and persistent global economic crises forcing resource-extracting economies to âstick to what they knowâ. Some critics have argued that rather than introduce a whole new set of structures, state actors should have worked with existing, already legitimate, forms of authority. Van Koppen et al. (2014) suggest that the nationalisation of water resources and the introduction of formal permit systems, while probably important in principle (particularly in highly unequal societies), have in fact facilitated further resource capture by the empowered and the undermining of local systems of governance. Yet there are success stories: Namibiaâs basin management committees, particularly in the western-draining ephemeral Kuiseb river basin, show the real potential for ideal-typical IWRM-style systems to emerge (Manning and Seely 2005). Indeed, the role of Rand Water, South Africaâs largest water services provider in the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area, suggests that public-private partnerships can work given a particular set of parameters4. In the transboundary context, states have shown a willingness to cooperate, though not quite extending to striking what Litfin (1997) describes as âsovereignty bargainsâ, such as those that typify the European Union. New modalities of decision-making have been successfully introduced; numerous multidisciplinary, transnational research and knowledge-generating projects and programmes are underway; and the important 14-year-old regional water research and education programme, WaterNet5, has been building the regionâs professional capacity. WaterNet is recognised as the water capacity-building arm of SADC, and its implementation through a set of regional universities and training institutions has promoted mutual understanding â even friendships â among regional water professionals. To be sure, some of these activities are being pushed by external actors, whose absence would quite possibly threaten the negotiation and bargaining processes. Much of this feels like one step forward, one step backward, yet"
73,564,0.309,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Urban agriculture in Cuba is practised along agrarian/agroecological rather than industrial/mechanised lines, with minimal artiï¬cial pesticides, fertilisers, or petroldependent technology (Diaz and Harris 2005; Manzano 2007), and with produce retailed directly to local food consumers (Premat 2012). The Cuban program was implemented in response to an acute food security crisis during the Special Period following the withdrawal of Soviet oil supplies in the early 1990s (Clouse 2014; Wright 2009). A signiï¬cant proportion of Cuban food production was shifted to urban land to bring sites of production closer to sites of consumption, as fossil fuel transport was limited by oil shortages (Wright 2009). Further, the shift to agroecological farming methods was driven by shortages of oil-based pesticides and fertilisers, and shortages of oil to drive farm machinery (Deere et al. 1994). Urban agriculture was not a deliberate governmental strategy to improve public and environmental health. There were, however, side-effects of the Cuban agricultural reforms which are anomalous in the developed world and which therefore merit the attention of Australian law and policy makers. Cuba is the only nation in the world to meet the World Wildlife Foundationâs deï¬nition of sustainable development, having both an acceptable ecological footprint per capita and an acceptable Human Development Index rating (World Wildlife Foundation 2006). Cubaâs low ecological footprint per person, low infant mortality and high life expectancy in the wake of the Special Period are an anomalous combination in the developed world. Immediately following the changes to Cubaâs food system in the early 1990s, there was a ârapid decline in death rates from diabetes and heart diseaseâ (Franco et al. 2013). Cuba is not here held up as a paragon or perfect model, and the Cuban system has past and ongoing problems (Hagelberg 2010; Alvarez 2001). The signiï¬cance of the Cuban data for Australian law and policy on urban food systems is that,"

If one day such tribes disappear, the end of the first chapter of our evolutionary book will have been written. The greatest majority of people today still live historically, in societies that rely on ICTs to record and transmit data of all kinds. In such historical societies, ICTs have not yet overtaken other technologies, especially energy-related ones, in terms of their vital importance. Then there are some people around the world who are already living hyperhistorically, in societies or environments where ICTs and their data processing1 capabilities are the necessary condition for the maintenance and any further development of societal welfare, personal well-being, as well as overall flourishing. The nature of conflicts provides a sad test for the reliability of this tripartite interpretation of human evolution. Only a society that lives hyperhistorically can be vitally threatened informationally, by a cyber attack. Only those who live by the digit may die by the digit (Floridi and Taddeo forthcoming). To summarise, human evolution may be visualised as a three-stage rocket: in prehistory, there are no ICTs; in history, there are ICTs, they record and transmit data, but human societies depend mainly on other kinds of technologies concerning primary resources and energy; in hyperhistory, there are ICTs, they record, transmit and, above all, process data, increasingly autonomously, and human societies become vitally dependent on them and on information as a fundamental resource. Added-value moves from being ICT-related to being ICT-dependent."

Water âinfrastructureâ is broad; it ranges from buckets or micro-basins to capture run-off for plant roots to large-scale dams. The state plays a crucial role in infrastructure development by investing in construction, operation and maintenance or by enabling and capacitating people to invest themselves in technologies for self-supply, for example, by training or supporting water technology supply chains and dissemination of, for example, affordable pumps and energy.

According to the UNâs own evaluation and despite considerable progress in some areas, high levels of hunger were still found in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, with moderate level of hunger persisting in Western, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, in Oceania, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and in Latin America and the Caribbean.

230,574,0.308,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"of marine ecosystem services, which are estimated at â¬16.5 trillion in one study (Costanza et al. 1997), suggest that even fractional deterioration in provision would represent a significant cost (Beaumont et al. 2007; Galparsoro et al. 2014). Thus far, studies undertaken to estimate the economic impacts of marine litter have generally focused on the direct losses borne by economic activities adversely affected by the presence of marine litter in the environment, within which they operate and rely upon (see Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; MacFayden 2009; McIlgorm et al. 2011). Largely, such studies have not taken into account the often intangible costs of any social and ecological impacts. Some early studies allude to the need for research to explore these costs. For instance, Kirkley and McConnell (1997, p. 185) call for strategies, which account for the economics related to lost ecological functions driven by marine litter. The intricacy of developing such strategies can be illustrated with the example of alien invasive species. Marine litter provides additional opportunities for marine organisms to travel (including alien invasive species) up to threefold (Barnes 2002). Given that the introduction of alien invasive species can have a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems and biodiversity (Kiessling et al. 2015) and can result in serious economic losses to many marine industries, any estimates, which exclude such ecological impacts, will inevitably fall seriously short of the true cost of the marine litter problem. For example, the introduction of the carpet sea squirt (Didemnum vexillum) in Holyhead Harbour (Wales, U.K.) resulted in an eradication and monitoring program over a decade starting in 2009, which was expected to cost â¬670,000. This expenditure was economically justified as allowing the species to spread unpredated and smother organisms and marine habitats would have cost the local mussel fisheries up to â¬8.6 million alone over 10 years (Holt 2009). Goldstein et al. (2014) recorded the ciliate pathogen Halofolliculina (known to cause skeletal eroding band disease in corals) on floating plastic debris in the western Pacific and suggested that the spread of the disease to Caribbean and Hawaiian corals may be due to rafting on the enormous quantities of litter reported from the area. Increased coral mortality or the introduction of other pathogens via floating marine debris may lead to economic costs, for example through decreased revenues due to falling numbers of visiting tourists. Despite their partial coverage, the studies that are available provide sufficient information to draw a number of important conclusions. The main economic sectors, which have been identified from the literature as being affected by marine litter are agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, commercial shipping and recreational boating, coastal municipalities, coastal tourism sector and the emergency rescue services (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010). The economic impacts affecting these sectors are described and quantified where possible (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; McIlgorm et al. 2011; Jang et al., 2014; Antonelis 2011). They also make attempts at aggregating economic impacts across sectors to provide regional cost estimates. Mouat et al. (2010) provide an estimate of marine litter costs for the Shetland (U.K.) economy, of â¬1â1.1 million on average per year, an estimate, which consists of actual expenditures and, in some cases, estimated lost income. This is only a single case study, and the sectors affected on Shetland would be affected to"
214,408,0.308,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"11.2.1 Goals of Prediction What exactly do we want to know from climate models? The basic answer is an estimate of the future climate, deï¬ned as the distribution of weather states. Climate is a function of space and time (summer climate, winter climate, particular location). We may also want an estimate of things derived from climate: stream flow, consecutive days above or below a threshold (heat and cold waves), or with and without precipitation (floods and droughts). The climate of the future is a function of the uncertainties we have discussed: initial condition uncertainty, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. On short timescales (a few days to a decade), initial condition (and internal variability) uncertainty dominates, and on century (or half-century) timescales, scenario uncertainty dominates. Model uncertainty remains over time, but may be signiï¬cant. Model uncertainty remains signiï¬cant at small scales, where model structural errors are important: If a model puts the storm track in the wrong place, it can consistently move storms (i.e., weather, precipitation) in incorrect ways and create"
140,98,0.308,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Burnes & Cook (2013) have written an extensive review of âï¬eld theoryâ research by that name. A broader framework, however, placing ï¬eld theory in a larger social science context, would be highly desirable. Only a few generations ago, about all that existed of âpolitical scienceâ was what we now call leadership theory, public policy and administration, and political philosophy. Psychology was dominated by the psychoanalysis schools inspired by Freud and behavior conditioning theories of Pavlov and Skinner. Crowd psychology, especially mob psychology (Le Bon) hinted at a crude form of ï¬eld theory. But so far as I can see presently, it was the insight of Adam Smith and the dynamic âinvisible handâ of the market place (the idea that the behavior of individuals and communities in interaction had a dynamic of their own that needed to be understood as distinct from individual psychology or crowd dynamics), that ushered in a third âlevel of analysis,â the system level. Today, of course, there is wide acceptance of the insights by Singer (1961) and othersâ that at least three analytic levels (individual, organizational or bureaucratic, and systemic) are needed in international relations theory, each with their own structures and functions. But even today, there is no systematic effort to integrate them into a multi-level theory, not to mention to follow the work of Richardson to examine longer term multi-nation dynamics. In this context of inchoate theory development, Rudyâs ï¬eld theory transcends earlier efforts in relative clarity and comprehensiveness."

Politically less powerful actors also strive to rescale decision-making processes in order to overcome undesirable policies and developments, structural constraints or environmental degradation. Chapter 11 describes the efforts of local communities to build up both glocal connections and coalitions with local governments in order to have control over consultations and decide about the implementation of mining projects in Latin America. According to Chapter 10, the scaling down of environmental governance to the local level is fundamental in safeguarding the self-determination of local communities. Chapter 9 argues that social capital and institutional strength in communities are key factors for the protection of forest commons and for local capacities to face traditional and emergent pressures on forest ecosystems. The extent to which local communities and social movements succeed in bringing about institutional change partly depends on their interactions with other actors. In this respect it is also important to point out that social actors (the state, corporations, communities, etc.) are not homogeneous entities. They may consist of various groups with different power, interests and positions, which may shift over time. Local governments, for example, occasionally confront central governments by developing alliances with local communities or other state agencies. Also, experts from corporations, governments and environmental organizations may take very different stances on energy efï¬ciency, production technologies and social responsibilities, despite the fact that they work in the same sector or country (see the analysis of views and discourses of strategic actors in Chapter 6). In some cases, environmentalists support local communities against development policies that promote the expansion of infrastructure and extractive industries in fragile ecosystems (Chapter 11). In other cases, they may favour compensatory schemes in conservation policies, regardless of the criticism raised by environmental justice movements (Chapter 8). In sum, while the central state has repositioned itself in processes of environmental governance of Latin America, institutional adaptation to the new contexts, discourses and demands has come from a range of (contesting) actors, and the interactions among them, across multiple scales. Overall, elite groups have tried to adjust some of their discourses and practices in order to partly comply with new demands and regulations, without having to give up their prominent position. Simultaneously, various marginalized groups have attempted to strike back by (re-)establishing and (re)appropriating local decision-making processes"
332,14,0.308,"Media Resistance : Protest, Dislike, Abstention","(1932), Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Fahrenheit 451 (1953) (see Ch. 3), to the more limited doomsday scenarios in ï¬lms such as Being there (1979), Videodrome (1983), The Truman Show (1989), Disconnect (2013) and Her (2014) (see Ch. 6), works of dystopian ï¬ction and ï¬lm provide speculative and fascinating answers to the question: What will happen if media continue to evolve along paths perceived to be destructive. In the same way as ï¬ctional accounts draw on real debates, participants in such debates, who express media resistance and scepticism, may be inspired by works of ï¬ction. Indeed, another reason why this book include analysis of ï¬ctional sources is that many works of resistance refer more liberally to ï¬ctional predictions than to (empirical) media research (see Ch. 7). While Brantlinger (1983, 37) argues â[d]oomsdaying, present to a greater or lesser extent in all ages, has become the chief mode of modern culture,â Solomon and Higgins (1996, 236) see doomsday scenarios as particularly prevalent in American thought. In terms of media resistance, there are comparatively more pronounced predictions of doom in the US compared with Europe, and much of the material in this book comes from the US. However, this may also be due to the much stronger position of commercial media in the US, particularly commercial broadcasting. As critics often point out, the US was founded by believers in the Enlightenment who struggled for freedom of expression, but disappointment set in as media were seen to betray their mandate (Pierce 2010; Postman 2005a; Gore 2007). In contrast, European cultures draw on not only Enlightenment ideals but also come from a history of religious censorship and absolutist monarchy, their modern media traditions more inï¬uenced by Victorian ideas of âupliftâ (Rowbotham and Stevenson 2003; Scannel and Cardiff 1991). Both in Britain and the Nordic countries there is a strong tradition of public service broadcasting, which have acted as a normative inï¬uence to a much larger degree than the public broadcasting service in the US (Croteau and Hoynes 2012, 81). In Scandinavia, media have to some extent been seen as part of the welfare state project; epitomized in terms such as âthe media welfare stateâ (Syvertsen et al. 2014). Instead of studying media resistance as moral or media panic, Luddism, lagging or cultural pessimism, this book sees media resistance as rooted in deep-seated values, from which the media are seen as destructive and counter-productive. A reaction against the media is always a reaction in favour of something else â something considered more important,"

Indeed, all across human history and geography, people have perceived, lived, used and explored marine resources in coastal lagoons and bays, estuaries and shores, which conducted to changes in those habitats and their natural populations. Consequently, coastal communities changed their values and perceptions of the sea, as well as their way of living and of using natural resources. Thus, advancing change within any civilization does not occur in a vacuum, but rather must evolve out of the given circumstances and discourses that prevail. For instance in western civilization, we cannot think of culture without considering the context in which products and goods are produced, mediated, and consumed over time. Thus, aquaculture as culture exists in relationship to broader societal discourses that evolve across different scales, from interpersonal and group relationships to mainstream media discourses (Bell-Jordan 2008; Fiske 1987; Rosteck and Frentz 2009). New aquaculture industries, especially in rural areas, should strive to integrate into the cultural fabric of the local community (Burbridge et al. 2001). This is paramount consideration, i.e. if an aquaculture industry develops successfully in a region or community that has previously been dominated by other types of industries, it can alter the very image of what the region, community and its inhabitants âisâ. This can be because the base economic activity has been a fundamental factor for the identity of the community and its inhabitants, be it ï¬sheries, tourism, agriculture or something else. It can be because aquaculture introduces new and very visible landscape elements, and a third possibility is that in-migration substantially alters the cultural mix in the community population. Furthermore, gender issues, like the opportunities for increased women participation and responsibility in the labor market through aquaculture development may gain more prominence. However, this seems to primarily have been an issue for developing countries (Veliu et al. 2009; Ndanga et al. 2013). How aquaculture development and planning processes are organized may also affect learning among and between stakeholder groups. Leach et al. (2013) examine qualities in aquaculture partnerships in the US that enhance knowledge acquisition and belief change, and these include procedural fairness, trustworthiness among participants, diverse participation and the level of scientiï¬c certainty. Their work also indicate that knowledge acquired through collaborative partnerships make the participants primed to change their opinions on science or policy issues.

In this chapter, it is argued that while global structures are important, contemporary multilevel and multi-actor governance patterns cannot be grasped without also including the roles played by individual countries and intergovernmental organisations. These actors are often driven by issue-specific interests but also bound by restrictions in terms of resource shortages and level of organisational skills. The focus of this chapter is on different measures that have been taken to reduce risks of accidental oil spills and strengthen operatorsâ incentives to follow rules and norms on intentional pollution. It will be argued that the EU plays an important role both as regulator and enforcer in marine environmental governance, namely, in between the regional (HELCOM) and the global level (IMO/ILO). HELCOM, on the other hand, plays an important mediating role between national interests among the Baltic Sea countries and regulations in the EU and IMO. Furthermore, it will be argued that individual countries play important roles in specific governance situations, especially when they perceive strong national interests to be at stake. Mechanisms to facilitate proactive governments taking action when it is in their interest to do so could in certain situations contribute to improved and more sustainable governance. The remaining part of this chapter is structured as follows. After a brief section on ecological and economic impacts of oil spills, we have a section on measures to reduce accidental spills and mitigate intentional spills. Examples of both command and control as well as incentive-based measures are given. The chapter concludes with a discussion on possible ways ahead, with a particular focus on what roles the EU and HELCOM can play in regional governance of marine oil transportations."
278,74,0.308,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"To decide what is a possible future and what is a credible scenario, scientists have established criteria that prospective models and their results need to fulfill. Exogenous assumptions need to be plausible and consistent. Often, they follow a certain scheme or idea that is called story line. Criteria for prospective models include process balancing constraints such as monetary, mass, or energy balances; the assumption that certain parameters, like efficiency improvement rates, do not leave empirically determined ranges; assumptions on human behavior; or the ability of the model to correctly determine the actual development from a given starting point in the past, using macro-indicators such as GDP as driver. Criteria for plausibility, consistency, and properties of exogenous assumptions and prospective models differ across modeling fields, mainly because of different academic traditions. This scientific inconsistency has repeatedly led to criticism across modeling disciplines, like our criticism of integrated assessment models from an industrial ecology perspective presented below. Are scenarios, or possible futures, also likely outcomes of future development? This often-raised question about the predictive capability of scenarios needs clarification. Strictly speaking, there cannot be a connection between possibility and likelihood in an indeterminate system, and a scenario can never be a prediction of the"

The consequences of pathogen introduction can be monitored directly (Sect. 2) or simulated using models (Sect. 6). The guidelines for IRA have been primarily developed from a trade perspective between two countries or regions to assess the disease risk associated with the import of live terrestrial production animals. However, the same principles can be applied to assess the risk of ranavirus introduction in wild or captive populations. In general, IRAs focus on possible infection of one species or several species within the same taxonomic class. As discussed in Duffus et al. (2015), ranaviruses are multi-species pathogens that have the capability of infecting three vertebrate classes, which makes IRA for ranaviruses complex. IRAs can be used to establish or revise trade or translocation guidelines for wildlife that could be subclinically infected with a pathogen (Smith et al. 2009). The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lists ranaviruses that infect amphibians as notifiable pathogens, meaning that a subsample of amphibians that are involved in international trade should be verified ranavirus negative prior to shipment (Schloegel et al. 2010). Currently, these regulations are not being enforced in most countries (Kolby et al. 2014). The procedures we outline below are based on principles and recommendations of the OIE (Vose 2000; OIE 2014), with examples of how they can be applied to parts of an IRA for the introduction of a ranavirus into an uninfected area."

273,92,0.308,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"status of environmental pollution as well as environmental pollution control technologies. But, it is more research on the various principles and control technologies of environmental problems from the perspective of natural science; it can only tell us the current status of environmental pollution and under such circumstance what technologies to be adopted for governance. Here are two problems: first, environmental pollution is not solely caused due to technical reasons; actually, environmental economics already demonstrated that the root cause is the externality of environmental resource, but people do not thoroughly understand this. Just because of the dual effects of both market failure caused by externality and policy failure caused by inadequate understanding, environmental problems appeared. Therefore, environmental pollution governance should essentially be to correct the market failure and policy failure. Secondly, assessment and measurement of environment must include status, pressure and response, because environmental change is such a dynamic consecutive process, during which, when human activities impose certain pressure on environment, environmental status would change and the society should respond to such change to restore environmental mass or prevent environment from degradation. If the measurement and assessment only covers current status of environment, the dynamic change of environment canât be obtained. (2) Natural resource and environmental economics. It discussed the root cause of environmental problems from the socio-economic perspective, put forward various policies and economic means to control environmental problems, explored the value connotation of environment and proposed different types of methodologies for environmental assessment. But, these analyses must be established on the data of environmental status. So, natural resource and environmental economics need the theoretical support of natural sciences such as environmentology. In addition, although natural resource and environmental economics attempted including environment (resource) into the system of national accounts so as to establish appropriate sustainable development ability evaluation system, there is still no single final conclusion from the existing environment and economic comprehensive accounting; from related research results we observed that there are at least two weaknesses: (1) Simple natural resource accounting or roughly putting natural resource depletion value and ecological environmental degradation value into national accounts. This fails to differentiate economic value and ecological value according to its correlation to economic strength and its essential characteristic; thus confusion of the relationship between economy and environment might occur, which is kind of barrier to the provision of objective, systematic and orderly baseline data for the establishment of policies regarding economy, natural resource, environment and other related price policies. (2) Roughly copying SEEA related concept of natural assets, which might lead to magnified comprehension of natural resource and misunderstanding of it, confused with concepts that are commonly used in economic sphere, such as economic assets and financial assets. Finally, environment and economic comprehensive accounting theory are already mature, but it can only be used to evaluate static regional sustainability, not the dynamic development trends of regional sustainability.

376,955,0.308,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Summary. Livestock (primarily including cattle, sheep, goats, equines, and camelids) provide the food and traditional economic basis for people living in the rangelands of developing countries; cultivation or wage employment opportunities are typically rare or nonexistent. The indigenous species and breeds are adapted to often harsh production conditions, and the flexibility of herd movement is very important for helping pastoralists cope with erratic rainfall patterns and disease outbreaks. Unlike the people on rangelands, population trends for livestock are more difficult to discern. Overall, livestock populations in some cases may exhibit âboom-and-bustâ patterns where growth periods are followed by sudden die-offs due to combinations of weather, disease, or level of forage competition among livestock. The spatial scale and frequency of herd crashes vary markedly. The difficulty in mitigating large herd losses is due to low levels of economic development and public investment. Mitigating such losses matters, however, because recurrent dieoffs translate into large economic losses for pastoral societies. For less-developed regions where human survival is most closely linked to livestock survival, the ratio of animals to people provides an important indicator of both food and asset security. Where this ratio has been monitored, the evidence shows that it has markedly"
231,609,0.307,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"However, separating a robust climate signal from natural variability was still problematic. While use of time-slices was a pragmatic approach to the limits of computer power, which prevented long simulations of high resolution atmospheric models, it risks sampling long-period natural variability rather than picking up aspects of a long-term trend. Reanalysis of the 20th century storminess suggested the need for time-slices much longer than a few years or even a couple of decades. Most of the earlier studies also did not credibly estimate uncertainties in the results. Lowe et al. (2009) used an ensemble of 11 regional climate models to drive a North Sea storm surge model and investigate uncertainty as part of the UKCP09 study. All of the experiments were transient and began before present day and extended to 2100 to avoid the time-slice problem. Focusing on the southern end of the North Sea near the Thames Estuary they found that only one of the model simulations had a statistically signiï¬cant increase in the height of the 50-year return period storm surge event. However, in physical terms this change of a few centimetres was small compared to the expected time-mean relative change in sea level. This result disagreed with many earlier studies but had the advantage of not needing to use time-slices. A recent reanalysis of the model results for sites outside the United Kingdom (Howard et al. 2014) suggested larger changes in the surge component at some locations, although for sea level extremes the effect of changes in time-mean SLR still typically dominated. Sterl et al. (2009) undertook a similar study using a global model ensemble and found a similar lack of a clear 21st century trend in the storm surge component, adding further weight to the projections from UKCP09. However, an important caveat is that the atmospheric model used for the UKCP09 ensemble was noted to have a particular storm track response; typically showing a southerly movement but with little evidence of an intensiï¬cation of the storms. While this is one credible future response the possibility of an intensiï¬cation of storms should not be completely ruled out, because some of the models used in IPCC assessments do show this (Lowe et al. 2009). A simple scaling argument suggested that if the ensemble of driving models had captured the largest increase in storm intensity from additional GCMs available it may have led to a bigger surge increase at some locations, comparable with changes in the future projected time-mean SLR. However, as such large changes in storm intensity were found in only one GCM (using the storm metric applied) the scaled results should be considered a low conï¬dence projection (Lowe et al. 2009). Gaslikova et al. (2013) investigated a set of four transient regional projections for the North Sea for which the underlying simulations of the global climate includes combinations of one GCM, two initial states and SRES scenarios A1B and B1.

Partnering in the form of public-private partnerships occur to provide specific services âin the realms of public health, development and environmentâ (Borzel and Risse 2010, p. 120; Healey 2015). Partnering allows collective learning and tackling inequality in place-based projects via new actor collaborations (Devolder and Block 2015) and for seeking resources to sustain the initiative itself (Healey 2015, p. 111; Sagaris 2014). The majority of research writings on impact of transition initiatives to sustainability transitions focused on site-specific impact and majorly under-examine the impact in context dynamics including governance. In our conceptual framework we include two mechanisms to describe and capture the way transition initiatives play out with the city context dynamics: Embedding and Instrumentalising. Instrumentalising is tapping into and capitalizing on opportunities provided by the multi-level governance context of the city-region in order to forge resources for the continuity of the operation of the initiative. Chmutina et al. (2014) note that the ability of transition initiatives to capitalize on opportunities also relies on the existence of âopennessâ situations within multi-level governance for change and for empowering transition initiatives. Acquiring resources is vital for sustaining the activities of the initiative that can also include regeneration of deprived areas (Fraser and Kick 2014, p. 1447; Healey 2015, p. 115) and for growing beyond a âtalking shopâ (Forrest and Wiek 2015). Embedding is the alignment of old and new ways of doing, organizing and thinking in order to integrate them into city-regional governance patterns. Bussu and Bartels (2014) point at embedding engagement and conflict resolution practices from community to the city governance and as a way of âformalizingâ community projects and participation methods (also addressed by Barr et al. 2011). Embedding involves the alignment of efforts, strategies and agendas/goals between transition initiatives and local government across scales (Horsford and Sampson 2014, p. 961; Garcia et al. 2015). Embedding is enabled by the recognition from the public sector to alter practices and be more responsive and receptive/dialectic to innovative practices coming from other actors (Boyer 2015, p. 322; Healey 2015; Healey and Vigar 2015; Frantzeskaki and Kabisch 2016). Overall, embedding captures the extent to which transition initiatives strategically shape the context in which they operate (Moss et al. 2014)."

365,538,0.307,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"This definition of resilience makes sense for a temporary change or disruption that a system can fully recover from, such as a seasonal drought followed by normal weather. However, if there are long-term changes, such as climate change, then the minimum loss would grow over time and the ratio Lossmin / Loss would be undefined. A solution to this problem is to measure the losses over a finite time period relevant to decision making for making technology investment decisions, so that the minimum loss and actual loss are both bounded. Figure 5 provides a stylized graphical representation of how resilience can be quantified for a temporary disruption as well as for a permanent change, over a specified time horizon from time t1 to time t2. In the analysis of a temporary disruption, the system provides a value V1 before the disruption occurs at t1. The disruption lowers the system performance to V2, and the system then recovers along some path from V2 back to V1 (the path is shown as linear in Fig. 5, but more generally may be nonlinear). Suppose we are comparing two different systems, one more resilient than the other. The heavy dashed line in Fig. 5 indicates the system with the most rapid recovery possible, and thus Lossmin equals area (A + D) and its resilience is 100% The less resilient system recovers along the path indicated by the lighter dashed line, so the loss is area (A + B + D + E), and the system resilience is calculated as 100 (A + D)/ (A + B + D + E) < 100%. The analysis of resilience to a long-term change in climate is somewhat different than the case of a temporary disturbance in several respects. In response to longterm changes we expect systems to be adapted to climate change to some degree. There are three types of adaptations that can be expected to occur and can overlap at different scales. First, there are the kinds of changes in management that farmers can undertake within the existing system, such as changes in planting dates and"

167,488,0.307,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"Understanding the ways in which Arctic science has been conducted is crucial to understanding how and to what degree intersectional analyses have been integrated into this body of scholarship. Intersectional research is generally part of the broader domain of social sciences, which itself has experienced âscience warsâ, a contestation of methodologies, methods, and approaches (Keating and Della Porta 2010). Social sciences operate at high levels of abstraction, where social inquiry includes exploring ontologies, epistemologies, approaches, methodologies, and methods without predetermining the process of inquiry (ibid). As such, different processes of inquiry result in different constructions and productions of knowledge. Feminists have long demonstrated a gendered and masculinist bias within concepts and approaches to scholarship, not least exemplified by the emphasis on rationality, objectivity, and public domains, often embodied by research in the natural sciences and visibly expressed in un-reflexive, silent authorship reinforcing âan unreflective orientation toward objectivist traditions and normsâ (Gray 2017: 180). A core feature of feminist and intersectional methodological approaches therefore includes the practice of âreflexivityâ whereby the researcher is ââresponsibleâ and âresponsiveâ to her work and her âsubjectsâ of study because it makes explicit the deliberative movement of her scholarshipâ (Ackerly et al. 2006: 258, cited in Agathangelou and Turcotte 2008). Reflexivity allows for insight into phenomena while also illuminating how such insights were derived: âthe closer an academic discipline is aligned with the natural science model the greater the pressure can be to engage in un-reflexive silent authorshipâ (Gray: 182). Thus, the dominance of a natural science heavy Arctic scholarship informed by objectivist methods plays a significant role in the acceptance and comprehension of what intersectional analy-"

38,561,0.307,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.2.1 Kenya Northern Kenya is a region of high biodiversity conservation value. It is a hotspot of mammalian diversity in Africa and is critical habitat for several endangered and threatened large mammal species. This region is largely under tribal communal tenure, and the rich flora and fauna of the region are threatened by heavy and continuous grazing by domestic livestock, which has caused moderate to severe land degradation over large areas (Georgiadis et al. 2007). Several NGOs, the largest of which is the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), have been working to promote wildlife conservation and better land stewardship in this region. In 2008, NRT and other scientists developed a simple protocol useable by community members to monitor rangeland condition, which, in turn, determines the amount and quality of forage for wildlife. These methods were based upon pastoralistsâ traditional knowledge and monitoring practices that were also be scientiï¬cally defensible. Through a series of conversations at which the NGOs, scientists, and community members were present, all participants agreed that the indicators currently used by pastoralists to make management decisions were insufï¬cient, as they were largely focused on livestock condition and grass conditions affected by rainfall. All agreed that a new protocol was needed to capture information about long-term (>3 year) trends in rangeland functionality. However, these methods would need to be simple so that they could be learned and used by community members with low literacy. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID-East Africa), a team of scientiï¬c experts was assembled, as well as a diverse advisory panel, to guide this project. This team conducted focus group interviews with community members representing the Maasai, Samburu, Borana, Afar, and Karyu ethnic groups in Kenya and Ethiopia. In these interviews, researchers asked community members to describe the changes in their rangelands they had observed over the last several decades. The responses were markedly similar across diverse social and ecological contexts: increased bare ground, decreased perennial grasses, increased woody vegetation, and increased soil erosion. These observations also matched the general indicators of degradation that have been observed by scientists working in rangelands around the world. Researchers then used this traditional knowledge to adapt an existing set of rangeland monitoring methods (originally developed and thoroughly tested in the western United States) for the East African context. Notably, the US methods were simpliï¬ed by basing them on a stick 1 m long (rather than measuring tapes or other manufactured tools) and created a single graphical data sheet on which data could be collected by circling icons. The intent was that these methods could be used by people who could not read or write but could count and recognise simple icons (e.g., a picture of a shrub representing a sample point with shrub cover)."

376,655,0.307,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Livestockâwildlife competition operates through two sets of processes within the socialâecological systems we call rangelands: economic processes influence agricultural and wildlife-based enterprises as sources of income for producer communities; ecological processes influence the relative efficiencies of livestock and wildlife species in utilizing the food and water resources occurring in their shared range. At the global scale, economic processes generally result in agricultural returns outcompeting wildlife returns and the patchwork of land use within rangelands intensifying towards croplands and fragmented rangelands (Hobbs et al. 2008). As markets, technology, and infrastructure develop, the position of a rangeland on its production possibility frontier (PPF) changes (Bastian et al. 1991; Smith et al. 2012) with agricultural production becoming specialized, driving down the possibilities for wildlife production (Fig. 12.1). The transition begins with a fully intact wildlife community (Point A) as still occurs in wildlife reserves, game ranches, and areas where diseases (e.g., trypanosomiasis in Africa) exclude livestock. Eventually livestock production is so specialized (Point C; irrigated and fertilized pastures, winter supplementation, fenced paddocks, etc.) that wildlife production is impossible. In some cases, well-regulated hunting for trophies and meat can add to the rangelandâs production potential from livestock (Point B), and infrastructure (waterpoints, access roads, etc.) provided for livestock production can also be beneficial to the sustainable utilization of wildlife. However, in most rangelands the transition has proceeded directly to maximizing livestock production (Point C) and restoring the wildlife community would necessitate a disproportionate pull-back in agricultural production, with unaffordable opportunity costs. Avoiding or overcoming those costsâincurred by foregoing land-use opportunities that are incompatible with wildlifeârequires innovative policies to enable competitive and sustainable returns from wildlife to local communities and private landowners (Norton-Griffiths and"
252,50,0.307,The Ethics of Vaccination,"tured, loose collections of individuals, rather than the responsibilities of organized, structured groups that can be assimilated to individual agents (List and Pettit 2011). Also, in principle and in an ideal world, the collective in question would have to include the entire global population, because local failures to realize herd immunity could endanger the life or health of the vulnerable people living in a certain area. Therefore, ideally, the type of collective obligation we are looking for would have to be what Bill Wringe called a âglobal obligationâ (Wringe 2014). However, in many areas of the world, and in developing countries especially, access to vaccines can be both very difficult and very expensive. It seems unreasonable to expect that people in poor countries who do not have access to vaccines have a collective moral obligation to contribute to the realization of herd immunity. I will proceed under the assumption that the collective obligation to realize herd immunity, although in principle a âglobal obligationâ, given the situation of our world, currently only applies to the group of people with easy access to vaccines. Now, if it is true that the obligation to realize herd immunity cannot be individual, it also seems problematic to argue that there exists a collective to which such responsibilities can be attributed. Some authors, for example Peter French (1984), have argued that only collectives with a formal decision structure can be the subjects of collective obligations. These types of groups constitute collective entities that, because of their internal structure and decision procedures, count as particular types of agents and therefore might bear a form of responsibility (as some have argued, including Pettit 2007, and List and Pettit 2011). However, people who together have the causal power to realize herd immunity constitute simply a random collection of individuals. There is no structured and formal connection or coordination among individuals that render them a collective agent. And to the extent that we think that only agents, that is, individuals that can intentionally act, can have the responsibility to act in certain ways, the collective that could realize herd immunity cannot have the moral responsibility to realize herd immunity, at least not in the same sense as agents like a state or a corporation have the responsibility to bring about or prevent certain outcomes. Attribution of collective responsibility to unstructured groups might reflect some form of metaphorical talking, but it is difficult to see how collective responsibility can literally be attributed to such groups. However, according to some, it is not necessary that a group has a structure and an internal organization in order to be considered an agent and therefore a subject of collective obligations.

183,166,0.307,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"9.1.3 Provider Safety in Surgery: Protecting Surgical Teams Patients are not the only ones who can get infected during surgeries. Some 85,000 medical providers worldwide are infected every single year by patient bodily fluids, with the vast majority of surgeons and obstetrician/gynecologists having experienced at least one exposure in the past year (Butsashvili et al. 2012). Despite the lower volume of invasive procedures occurring in austere settings, 90% of providers infected were working in such settings (World Health Organization 2011). Such chronic risks were thrust into sharp relief during the Ebola epidemic, when, for instance, Sierra Leoneâs surgeons encountered 100-fold infection rate increases compared with the general population, resulting in the death of 25% of the surgeons in the main teaching hospital of the capital (Yasmin and Sathya 2015; Bundu et al. 2016).

347,342,0.307,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"There are different barriers to public participation and communication in environmental governance and decision-making. First, there are structural factors including lack of opportunities and resources to participate. The other main problem seems to be a lack of interest from the public (Zavestoski et al. 2006), something that at least in part could be explained by differences in agenda between scientists, policymakers and citizens. Previous studies of communication in marine governance procedures underline the importance of common agendas. Experiences of stakeholder communication and participation reveal that it is difficult to recruit citizens to participate in deliberative procedures such as hearings (RISKGOV 2011). One possible reason is that the concerned issues are not part of the publicâs agenda. We see a relationship between the amount of media reporting and action taken. In Sweden and Germany, national news media have, for example, widely acknowledged the issue of overfishing, and the extent and content of reporting has induced public authorities to take corrective action through highly targeted information provision. There is however less incentive for regional organisations like HELCOM to take such actions because of the lack of reporting and a common agenda at the regional (i.e. transnational) level (cf. Dreyer et al. 2011; JÃ¶nsson 2011). This lack of a regional public arena and agenda supported by the mass media makes it more difficult to raise awareness of regional environmental risk issues among the public of that region. The media can play an important role in the development of common agendas on a national level (cf. McCombs 2005; McCombs and Shaw 1972), which in turn is crucial for generating interest from citizens and consumers (cf. Dreyer et al. 2011). The reasons that common agendas are important are because they place a certain (risk) issue on the agenda that may consequently enhance (public) engagement and increase the possibility and quality of (public) participation, which will result in improved (risk) management and policy implementation. In this process, the media and its agenda-setting function (cf. McCombs and Shaw 1972) is of utmost importance. The basic logic behind the âagenda-settingâ concept is that there is a relationship between the amount of attention a certain issue receives in the news media and the extent to which the public consider this issue to be of special importance. This thus also means that in order to become part of the public agenda, news about environmental risks in relation to the Baltic Sea must be considered"

A small but consistent thread of reference to the social dimension of energy policy exists throughout its evolution and, in the wake of the economic crisis and concerns about rising costs and vulnerable populations, this has taken on a new significance. At the launch of the Europe 2020 Strategy in 2010, the European Commission noted that âto lift people out of poverty will require access to energy since achieving the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2015 cannot be met unless substantial progress is made on improving accessâ (European Commission, 2010b, p. 17). This was the first statement linking energy to poverty eradication within the EU context, as opposed to external relations and development. It was soon followed by a number of similar policy statements. During the discussion of the 2050 Energy Roadmap, the Commission stated that âas energy poverty is one of the sources of poverty in Europe, the social aspects of energy pricing should be reflected in the energy policy of Member Statesâ (European Commission, 2011, p. 17), while the Parliament welcomed the inclusion of a social dimension and insisted that the issue of energy poverty be given special attention. An important social policy statement on energy poverty was made by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), which highlighted the importance of links with other sectors, such as health, consumer rights and housing, urging Member States to do more to combat energy poverty and calling on the Commission to establish a European Energy Poverty Monitoring Centre to provide better research and facilitate the mainstreaming of energy poverty into other policy areas (European Economic and Social Committee, 2011). The EESC asserted: The European Union legislates on energy policy, has powers in this field and consequently has an impact, whether direct or indirect, on energy poverty in the Member States. The EU must, therefore, act and deliver policies within its sphere of competence. (European Economic and Social Committee, 2011, p. 44/56)"

However, there is no obligation to compensate for loss of ecosystem services; consequently, the farmer does not pay for the damage that he or she inflicts on the owner of the water body. Similarly, there is no requirement for the owner of the water body to pay the farmer (as the owner of the land) if he or she abstains from using chemical fertilizers (the absence of which could inhibit the farmerâs production). As shown in Table 10.1, human activities such as use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides, and conversion of agricultural land for human settlements, can generate ecological risks. These include poor soil quality, water pollution, and food insecurity resulting from reduced ecosystem services, especially provisioning services. In Indonesia serious land use changes occur as a result of rapid expansion of oil palm plantations that replace ecologically valuable tropical rainforest and mangrove. This is a situation in which human action causes CO2 emission responsible for climate change and global warming. Furthermore, clearance and draining of peatland enhances fire and causes carbon stock to emit CO2 into the atmosphere. Although the countryâs economic development is essential, therefore, the ecological risks associated with the development are pervasive."

365,433,0.307,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"There is growing global recognition of the urgent need to identify and implement strategies that make food systems more resilient in the face of increasing climate variability. Nowhere is this more evident than in Sub-Saharan Africa.1 Because the majority of Africansâ livelihoods and agrifood systems rely on rainfed farming, Africa is one of the worldâs regions most vulnerable to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that âclimate change is expected to have widespread impacts on African society and Africansâ interaction with the natural environmentâ (IPCC 2014, p. 812). Climate smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as an approach to enhance the resilience of farm systems to the effects of climate change. CSA is defined by three principle objectives (FAO 2013): 1. sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; 2. adapting and building resilience to climate change, and; 3. reducing and/or removing greenhouse gases emissions, where possible. In Africa and other predominantly agrarian regions, there is particular interest in identifying strategies to encourage farmers to adopt practices and technologies that enable more resilient, sustainable and productive farms, while at the same time identifying system-wide collective action to promote a wide range of ex ante risk management activities and ex post coping strategies. Given the scope and scale of these requirements, leveraging public sector resources is critical. Input subsidy programs (ISPs) provide a potentially useful means to encourage system-wide coordination and farmer behaviours that raise agricultural productivity and contribute to resilience objectives in Africa, while potentially mitigating the agricultural sectorâs contribution to GHG emissions. ISPs vary in their distribution modalities and targeting requirements, but generally share the common attributes of providing inorganic fertilizer, and in some countries, improved seeds, to farmers at below-market prices. Many African governments currently devote a large share of their agricultural sector and national budgets to ISPs. The region spends just over US$1.0 billion each year on ISPs (Jayne and Rashid 2013; Jayne et al. forthcoming). A major challenge to enabling ISPs to promote CSA outcomes stems from the major opportunity costs they entail in terms of foregone public spending on other core CSA investments such as irrigation, agricultural R&D, and extension services that could potentially promote CSA practices more effectively per dollar invested than ISPs. However, there is clearly scope for market-smart ISPs to improve smallholder farmersâ access to climate smart technologies and overall resilience. This paper assesses the feasibility of leveraging public investments in ISPs to promote adoption of CSA practices and technologies by African farmers. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 begins by defining CSA in the context of African smallholder farming systems. Section 3 briefly examines the range"
75,153,0.306,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","Case 2: Twitter for Citations Beyond conferences, Twitter also plays an increasingly important role for day-today communication among scientists. Academics are often interested in a variety of topics outside of their specific field of research and accordingly tweet about many things which are the not subject of their work or comment in ways that differ from traditional scholarly communication. This highlights an issue of informal digital communication online: it is extremely hard to determine what constitutes a scientifically ââvaluableââ contribution and what does not. While some tweets are related to scholarly issues and others are obviously personal in nature, many occupy a meso-level between what is traditionally considered scholarly content and what usually is not. Counting every tweet mentioning a scholarly source as scientifically valuable is obviously too simplistic, as is discarding every personal remark as irrelevant. This is a particularly salient issue because an increasing number of studies examine the relevance of social media for scientometrics, in other words, the role that social media can play in measuring and predicting the impact of scientific research (e.g., Weller and Puschmann 2011; Eysenbach 2011). By conservative estimates, popular sites such as arXiv received around 5,000 links per month9 and this is bound to increase in the future. If the popular reception of scholarly literature among scientists and non-scientists alike via Twitter can be considered a form of impact (and many agree that it can), this means that citations on Twitter and via other channels may be introduced as a valid impact measure into the scientometric toolkit in the future [cf. the suggestions of Priem et al. (2011) in this direction]."
148,41,0.306,Anti-fragile ICT Systems (Volume 1.0),"outbreaks spread far and robust when new malware outbreaks have very limited spreading. The system is anti-fragile to malware spreading if it first learns to reduce the fraction of infected devices, for example, to less than 1 % and then manages to keep the fraction of infected devices low even as the spreading mechanism of the malware changes. Part III develops a novel malware-halting technique that prevents frequent malware outbreaks from propagating over huge networks of computing devices. Calculations and simulations using slightly modified epidemiological models from network science [23] determine the time-averaged fraction of infected devices. Chapter 8 outlines how application stores utilizing compilers with so-called diversity engines [24] can generate enough software diversity to gain robustness to malware spreading by halting frequent malware outbreaks with a fixed spreading mechanism. It also argues that diversity slows down persistent targeted attacks. Chapter 9 studies malware types that spread over networks with an unknown topology. The malware studied have the ability to reinfect nodes multiple times. Acquaintance immunization [25] and software diversity are combined to gain robustness to malware reinfections. While reinfections generally help malware stay alive for a long time, the described halting technique prevents malware outbreaks from spreading very far before they die out. Chapter 10 combines cloud computing, time-varying software diversity, immunization, and imperfect malware detection/removal to model and analyze networks that gain anti-fragility to malware spreading by learning to halt and remove malware with unknown and time-varying spreading mechanisms. Non-infectious malware mistakenly downloaded by computer users are viewed as infectious malware with limited spreading ability."

Examples of Ecological and Biophysical Models EPIC (Environmental Policy and Integrated Climate) was originally developed at the US Department of Agriculture to study the effect of agricultural production on erosion and soil productivity. Since its creation, it has been further developed by several research institutes into a comprehensive terrestrial ecosystem model for simulating numerous ecosystem processes that can also take a wide range of land-use management options into account (e.g. tillage, harvest, fertilization, irrigation, drainage, liming, burning, and pesticide application). The main components in EPIC are crop growth, weather simulation, hydrology, nutrient and carbon cycling, soil temperature and moisture, soil erosion, tillage, and plant environment control (Izaurralde et al. 2012; BalkovicÌ et al. 2013). When combined with economic models or model networks to assess agricultural and forestry biomass production, EPIC can be used to address two major research questions: the effect of changing environmental conditions on biomass production, e.g. forecast crop yields impacted by climate change ((Kraxner et al. 2013; Kirchner et al. 2015), and the impacts of different management options for biomass production on the environment, e.g. erosion, nitrogen leaching, or soilborne greenhouse gas emissions (Schwarz-v. Raumer et al. 2017). The soil-crop model CERES-EGC functions in a similar way to EPIC. It has been used for more than 20 years to investigate the environmental effects of crop cultivation such as nitrate leaching, soil greenhouse gas emissions, and ammonia and nitrogen oxides (Durandeau et al. 2010). CERES-EGC can also be used to predict yields of the most important agricultural crops (Mavromatis 2016). Both models can be used at field and regional scales.

269,171,0.306,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"(not least the neurosciences), we throw our lot in with those disciplines â that we are, in other words, co-producers of the very epistemic power from which we claim to distance ourselves (Cooter 2011, 2014). Worse (we caricature here): the sciences with which we are entangled have been the source of deleterious discourses on, for example, race, class, and gender; that scholars in the social sciences and humanities had long built up a conceptual armature to counteract such discourses; and that by mingling those concepts with the methods and theories of the neurosciences, people like us actually evacuate the space for such critical work. To the extent that people become raced, gendered, and classed subjects through particular relations of power, and to the extent that scientific research has bolstered and solidified such relations (especially when it is increasingly licensed to talk about social life) â then our dirge for subjugation starts to look hollow indeed. This is a vexed and serious critique that we cannot do justice to here. It is undeniably true that neuroscientific research has been mobilized in deeply problematic ways (we say âmobilizedâ to gesture at the frequent distance between research in the laboratory and its diverse applications). There is now an extensive body of research on the effects of neuroscientific discourses on policy, especially as that policy has been brought to bear on predominantly working-class and ethnic minority families (e.g. Edwards, Gillies and Horsley 2015; Lee, Macvarish and Lowe 2014; Pykett 2015). There is an even more prominent discourse about neuroscience and gender, which is often self-consciously essentializing (e.g. BaronCohen 2003) â resulting in popular claims that are, as the psychologist Cordelia Fine has pointed out, sometimes âspuriousâ or âmisinterpretedâ (Fine 2010, 283). âThe imaginative readerâ, Fine goes on, will not have too much difficulty envisaging how, by reinforcing stereotypes, such claims may affect peopleâs social attitudes in ways that oppose progress toward greater gender equality, just as such claims did in the past.

Unlike the adult helminths, except for the Monogenoidea that can reproduce on their hosts, individual protozoans can produce offspring in or on the fish host. The protozoans such as coccidians, myxosporidians, microsporidians, ciliates, and others as well as monogenoids can replicate in or on the host. Consequently, a disruption in the system can stress the host or otherwise make it more susceptible to excessive replication resulting in a prolific increase in parasite numbers, a harmed host, and an indication of a disrupted and unhealthy ecosystem. We will use biodiversity of parasites both as individuals and as communities to provide exemplary information on healthy and harmed model systems. The associated biota also goes through seasonal and long-term alterations, and these alterations can also be modified in detectable ways by both anthropogenic and natural environmental events. Understanding biodiversity of parasites and their hosts in the Gulf of Mexico is accompanied by numerous problems. Table 14.2 helps us start understanding some of those problems regarding helminths.

The basic assumption herein is that the social web and Web 2.0 technologies allow scientists, on the one hand, to open up the research process and, on the other, to prepare the product of their research for interested non-experts (see Table 2). Accordingly, we recognize two different streams within the public school: The first is concerned with the accessibility of the research process (the production), the second with the comprehensibility of the research result (the product). Both streams involve the relationship between scientists and the public and define openness as a form of devotion to a wider audience. In the following section we will elaborate more on both streams in reference to relevant literature."
321,101,0.306,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"Japan as a Resource Self-Sustaining Nation The times are vastly changing owing to the growth of developing nations. The era in which primary resources could be bought cheaply is already ending. In the future, although prices will rise and fall because of changing economic conditions and other factors, over the long term the price of primary resources will no doubt continue to rise. Looking back at the past, crude oil prices have continued to rise from the 1960s, the era when it was a dollar per barrel. Even iron ore, with its large reserves, has lately jumped in price. Not only price increases, but also indications can be seen that resources are being depleted. For example, take the large-scale crude oil discharge accident that occurred in April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana (BP web-site 2013). This showed us the following realities: Of the reserve-rich and easily exploited oil fields on land, almost none now remain, and exploiting oil fields beneath the deep ocean brings with it great risks and high costs. It is not only a matter of energy resources such as crude oil, but as we head toward 2050 the worldâs population will increase, and the problem of food shortages will grow more severe. Accompanying the enriching of economies, eating habits will shift from being centered on grain consumption and meat consumption will increase. Because eating meat is less energy efficient than consuming grain directly, greater grain production will be necessary. The depletion of timber resources is also a serious problem. In times past, many civilizations consumed great quantities of timber as an energy resource and building material, and as a result of using up the forests, they collapsed. We must learn from this history. In light of this situation, what actions must Japan take with respect to âVision 2050â? In Japanâs case, the share of the total energy supply accounted for by nonfossil sources is 16 % (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy 2010). In Japan, with its limited land surface, installing solar panels on all roofs and idle land would be able to cover about 8 % of present energy consumption. Wind, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal will also be used. If nuclear power too is employed and the share of non-fossil energy sources is doubled, then they will make up 32 % of the total current energy consumption."

365,75,0.306,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"order to make predictions of yields and outputs. There is much uncertainty in climate modeling and it must be incorporated into policy design. Thus, it is not sufficient to get average predictions of climatic patterns over time, but also some indication of variability and reliability thereof. Uncertainty of weather patterns is important because as Dixit and Pindyck (2001) suggested, the pattern and levels of uncertainty delay the optimal timing of investment. With uncertainty, decision-makers value additional information and are willing to wait some time for more information, which can lead to significant delays in investments. This compounds risk-averse farmersâ disincentives to invest in land or adopt new technologies. A second dynamic element is population growth, which affects demand for food as well as urbanization patterns, both of which are important determinants of optimal agricultural growth pathways. Human population growth is also behavioral to some extent and thus population dynamics must take account of behavioral parameters. Furthermore, population dynamics are subject to uncertainty so we must consider outcomes under several scenarios in assessing and designing climate change policies. The third dynamic element is the ongoing transition in agriculture associated with globalization and the spread of information and technological advances. Global supply chains are spread everywhere, and the expanded use of the internet, cell phones, and improved transportation mechanisms are likely to continue. Technological change is especially important given the role of innovation and adoption in adaptation to climate change, but its diffusion will be a function of both political constraints as well as the need to adapt technologies to site-specific characteristics. One also needs to understand the workings of the supply chain innovations in different regions and how they can be utilized to introduce new technologies in response to climate change. While further integration and connectivity can increase agricultural system resilience by reducing, pooling and transferring risks, positive results will nonetheless be a function of the international and national level regulatory frameworks. To achieve food security objectives, such frameworks need to incorporate regulations that limit monopolistic/oligopolistic power and instead harness the risk-reducing benefits for everyone in the agricultural system, as well as effective enforcement mechanisms."

The efforts of the EU to promote the concept the knowledge-based bioeconomy proved remarkably successful. In 2005, the European Commission held a conference entitled âNew Perspectives on the Knowledge-Based Bio-Economyâ (EC 2005). At this conference, Janez PotocÌnik, the European Commissioner for Science and Research, gave a speech entitled âTransforming life sciences knowledge into new, sustainable, eco-efficient and competitive productsâ (PotocÌnik 2005). In the so-called Cologne Paper of 2007, this title has been quoted as a definition of the knowledge-based bioeconomy. The Cologne Paper was based on a workshop held under the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2007 in the city Cologne. The workshop was attended by experts from research organizations and companies covering different fields, including crop production, biotechnology, bioenergy and biomedicine (EU 2007). The Cologne Paper emphasized the two dimensions of the bioeconomy mentioned above: â¢ On the one hand, the paper identified the role of biotechnology as âan important pillar of Europeâs economy by 2030, indispensable to sustainable economic growth, employment, energy supply and to maintaining the standard of livingâ (EU 2007, p. 4). One can label this dimension of the bioeconomy âthe biotechnology innovation perspectiveâ. â¢ On the other hand, the Cologne Paper stressed the use of crops as ârenewable industrial feedstock to produce biofuels, biopolymers and chemicalsâ (EU 2007, p. 4). The paper also envisaged that âby 2020, in addition to the then mature gasification technologies, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass by enzymatic hydrolysis will be standard technology opening up access to large feedstock supplies for bioprocesses and the production"

364,311,0.306,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract We are frequently required to assess, mitigate, and monitor certain environmental risks involved in our daily activities at both the local and global environment levels. Corporations, in particular, can cause environmental pollution or other risks as a result of either accidents or natural events. In order to limit, and hopefully prevent, these environmental impacts, environmental risk management places a strong emphasis on targeting the problems that could arise, and implements a system of metrics that help with prevention and management. Eutrophication is one example of a widespread environmental pollution phenomenon that is currently worsening in lake basins. Proliferation of phytoplankton is due primarily to high concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) discharged from industrial and urban waste. However, assessing, managing, and forecasting the pollution of basins requires considerable time and support tools to analyze a range of water quality indicators over time and geographical area. This study investigated the relationship between organic matter (chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total N, and P) and biomass of phytoplankton (indicated by Chlorophyll-a) in order to shorten the period required for analysis, predict eutrophication of lakes ahead of time, and promptly prevent the spread of contaminants. Based on this relationship, we can use Chlorophyll-a as a biological indicator in monitoring and assessing the levels of organic pollution. In addition, we can identify ways to reduce pollution and transportation of pollutants in stagnant lake basins, and contribute to reducing the damage due to environmental risks.

Parliamentary questions were now being raised about Portonâs annual cost to the taxpayer.42 Reflecting public concerns about a substantially weakened economy, the MP Hugh Morrison queried in 1920 whether the government would not be well advised to âhave it [Porton] closed down.â In his cautious reply, which avoided revealing that the total cost of the establishment had been around Â£90,000 in 1919â1920,43 Winston Churchill told the House of Commons that the government aimed to keep the experimental facility open âuntil the attitude of the League of Nations to chemical warfare is deï¬ned.â44 In March 1922, prompted by the Washington Agreement, the government came under renewed pressure, but insisted that it âwould be failing in its duty if it failed to take all possible steps which might be necessary to protect the Forces of the Crown and the inhabitants of the country against gas attacks in time of war.â45"
376,779,0.306,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Antagonistic interactions, or trade-offs, indicate that management practices or events that increase one type of ecosystem service may negatively affect other ecosystem services (OÃ±atibia et al. 2015). For example, land management practices that lead to increases in the provisioning of food may result in a reduction of clean water purification, creating trade-offs in the provisioning of ecosystem services (RaudseppHearne et al. 2010). Planting trees to increase carbon sequestration or timber production may decrease stream flow in arid areas and represents a trade-off (Nosetto et al. 2008). In summary, ecosystem service research has advanced to identify nature as a complex provider of human benefits (MA 2005). The rangelands of Patagonia provide an example of trade-offs and winâwin relationships among ecosystem services depending on management. An example of winâ win is the maximization of carbon, nitrogen, and forage availability at intermediate grazing intensities (Fig. 14.4). A critical provision service, such as forage biomass, is"
10,393,0.306,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"12.6.1 Motivation Motivation refers to the goals and values, external pressure, and orientations that drive the actor in a speciï¬c way. Among nature and conservation actors, the context of water scarcity and drought produces highly varied motivations. In many cases, the motivation of nature conservation stakeholders is triggered to a large extent by their own goals and values. On the whole, both nature organizations and farmers are aware of the implications of water scarcity and drought on nature areas, such as the loss of flora and fauna in river systems, algae blooms and crop failures. Such external pressures on a global environmental change scale serve as a primary internal motivator among these actors. In addition, external governance pressures, such as the requirements set forth by the Natura 2000 regulations provide a strong impetus to implement measures to combat drought. Regulations, incentives and communications play a large role in motivating action among stakeholders. The EU Directives in particular have created pressures on relevant stakeholders (e.g. water boards) to devise collaborative solutions to address water scarcity and drought. Despite such top-down pressures, large regional disparities in resources and water use create cascading pressures at the local level. Lack of resources tends to motivate local led initiatives to develop their own innovative tools for drought-related problems. Despite strong economic interests, governance pressures can override them depending on the strength of the regulation. For example, in the case of Somerset, motivated actors from nature conservation organizations, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Somerset Wildlife Trust (SWT), developed long-term visions for transforming the landscape from human-centred to exclusively for nature by restoring open grassland landscapes. In the face of strong economic interests, the beneï¬ts of a more resilient and robust landscape in the face of extreme weather outweighed competing pressures. Such harmonization of initially competing motivations is at the heart of sustainable and integrative land and water management as well as coping with extreme weather events, including drought and flood (Robins 2014)."

One was John Galgiani, who worked at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of Arizona, Tucson, and was the leading expert on coccidioidomycosis in that state. His specialism was immune responses and he was amongst the first to publish on coccidioidomycosis in AIDS sufferers.40 Over many years he campaigned for recognition that coccidioidomycosis was becoming a disease of national importance, because of continuing high rates of in-migration to Southwestern states and the increase in the number of immunosuppressed patients. General population mobility was also a factor, with many cases presenting outside of endemic areas in out-migrants; indeed, he reported that 46% of coccidioidomycosis patients with AIDS were in non-endemic areas.41 In 1996, coccidioidomycosis was being discussed as âa re-emerging infectious diseaseâ.42"

Most of the energy escapes again, but if mass is conserved, then the difference between the energy into the system and out represents energy available in the system. Figuring out where the energy goes is complex, but it is necessary to make sure energy is conserved. This also allows us to move âoff scaleâ of current energy inputs and have some conï¬dence that we are not accidentally gaining or losing energy in the simulated climate system. The concept of evaluation and the energy and mass constraints can also be used to describe how a climate model is able to represent the complex earth system with complex interactions of processes occurring on many scales. If each process or parameterization or set of processes (such as a cloud model, or a biogeophysical model of how plants move water and carbon) can be evaluated against observations, and also is bounded by physical constraints, then the resulting combination of these processes should be able to represent important features of the climate system. What does this basic physical constraint mean? For a cloud model (or cloud parameterization in an atmosphere component of a climate model), there are a series of descriptions of evaporation, formation of cloud drops, how rain begins to fall, freezing, and the like. But the overall cloud can have only as much water as is available to condense, and the energy of that condensation and/or evaporation has to go somewhere. These constraints act at every point in space and time in a model, and require all clouds in a model to meet these constraints and be physically realistic. Add up many processes pushing and pulling on the system, and climate models actually do a pretty good job of getting a decent climate for the present based on detailed comparisons to observations. The constraints of energy and mass also allow for some conï¬dence in prediction. Another method of evaluation is to use a climate model with appropriate initial conditions to simulate individual weather events. Many models are moving to âuniï¬edâ weather and climate models for this reason (see below)."

With a changing climate, policy makers and advisors face challenges on how to mitigate and adapt while taking into consideration societal goals. One of the ways to deal with societal goals in the context of climate change is through nature-based solutions, including a wide range of green and blue infrastructure measures. This chapter focuses on urban gardens, particularly allotments and community gardens, as one type of green infrastructure. Allotment gardens are mostly larger estates divided into plots that are allocated under rental payments to a single person or a family for non commercial cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants and recreational purposes. They are normally ruled and managed by local authorities, associations, or private or public organizations. In contrast, community gardens are single pieces of land that are gardened and managed collectively by a group of people. Community gardens, may have a permanent or temporary character, and are often characterized by informal claiming of urban voids with the purpose of local community development (Adams et al. 2013). In this chapter, we explore how allotment and community gardens can serve as multifunctional nature-based solutions to achieve both climate-related and societal goals. Throughout the chapter, case studies illustrate how ecosystem services are provided by urban gardens in cities such as Lisbon, Leipzig, Manchester, and Poznan, all set in different socio-ecological contexts across Europe from northern to southern regions and from eastern to western regions.

192,60,0.305,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"researchers may become the victims of science as well: tormented, craving subjects (Mayer, Cantor, etc.: $), who suffer from experiences of crisis, comparable to how Oedipus fell victim to a political crisis in mythic times, but at the same time adding something to the oedipal scenario (Lacan 1966, p. 870), because for Lacan the subject of science introduces a new type of subjectivity (S2), as we have seen. The âsubjective dramaâ of scientific progress can be represented by the formula S2 â $ which points to the subversion of the impassive, rational agent (S2) and the resurgence of the divided, tormented subject ($). Whereas the ancient worldview concurred with the concept of the Platonic sphere, and the modern worldview developed on the basis of the Cartesian coordinate system, the question inevitably emerges what mathematical concept represents the basic topology (the basic spatiality and subjectivity) of the current era, which began in 1900? For Lacan, the basic topological structure which exemplifies contemporary scientific subjectivity is the Moebius ring. Psychoanalysis is not depth psychology, he argues, and the unconscious is not a hidden animalistic or archetypal depth of an allegedly rational conscious subject. Rather, the unconscious is the reverse side of consciousness. In the case of a Moebius ring, although there is only one surface, there is always a reverse side, a blind spot, a missing part. But once we get there, the opposite side is lost to us again, for there is always a reverse (1962â 1963/2004, p. 161). We will never reach a position of absolute knowledge, and the gap between knowledge and truth cannot be sutured. The subject of science is constituted by this split, this rupture between (partial) knowledge and (unattainable) truth (1961â1962, p. 48, p. 87, p. 189, p. 199) and this creative failure or impotence (dÃ©faillance, âÏ) fuels rather than discourages the will to know (1968â1969/2006, p. 275)."
252,19,0.305,The Ethics of Vaccination,"tend to delay vaccinations or opt only for certain vaccines at any one time (DubÃ© et al. 2014a). Of courseâand this is a relevant distinction in order to circumscribe the focus of this bookâwe also need to distinguish non-vaccination that is due to peopleâs choices or negligence more generally (including, as we will see, the negligence of giving in to unconscious biases) and nonvaccination that is due to factors beyond peopleâs control. Sometimes people do not have (easy enough) access to vaccines, particularly in developing countries (Favin et al. 2012), but also in developed onesâespecially in those with high rates of immigration. Distance from health facilities, internal population displacements and insecurity, and the fact that many illegal immigrants are afraid of being reported to the police if they visit health facilities (DubÃ© et al. 2014b) are among the factors that might hinder vaccination uptake in many countries. These circumstances contribute to the spread of infectious diseases as much as, if not more than the sociological, cultural, or psychological factors that influence individualsâ choices not to vaccinate themselves or their children where vaccination is easily accessible. In fact, difficulties in accessing vaccines account for a significant number of cases of preventable diseases and death worldwide. It has been estimated (Durrheim and Crowcroft 2017) that measles vaccination saved 7.1 million lives worldwide between 2000 and 2015. This looks like a remarkable datum, as it obviously is in many respects. However, this figure pales in comparison with the 114,900 people who died of measles worldwide only in 2014 (Perry et al. 2015): if several million lives were saved where vaccines are easily accessible, it is simply unacceptable for 114,900 people to die in one year of the same easily preventable disease just because many of them have difficulties accessing vaccinesâjust as it is simply unacceptable, to compare, that malnutrition and starvation still exist in certain parts of the world while there is overabundance and waste of food in others. Although these 114,900 deaths represent a stunning 79% decline in measles-related deaths from the 456,800 fatalities of 2000, they remain an objectively too high death toll for a disease that is vaccine-preventable, especially in light of the fact that, since 2010, progress towards the WHOâs goal of eliminating measles from four WHO regions has significantly slowed down (Perry et al. 2015, p. 623). The vast majority of those 114,900 deaths are not the result of peopleâs choices, as is likely the case for most if not all of the about 40 deaths of measles in Europe in 2017."

347,250,0.305,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, regional collaboration was more or less restricted to governmental discussions within the framework of the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) and scientific collaboration at expert levels. The cold war placed strict limits on what was politically possible to achieve. According to some observers, HELCOM was primarily a means for the Soviet Union to find a relatively neutral ground for airing declarations mainly targeted at US audiences (Hjorth 1992). However, the early role of HELCOM as a first institutionalisation of regional collaboration for the protection of the Baltic Sea environment should not be underestimated (Hassler 2003b). During HELCOMâs first two decades of existence, important scientific contacts were developed especially between researchers from Nordic countries and the Soviet Union. These Baltic Sea networks were important building blocks and resulted in several recommendations made by the still rudimentary, epistemic communities on concrete measure that could be taken with regard to ecological threats to the Baltic Sea environment. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the declaration of independence of Baltic states and the democratisation of Poland in the early 1990s, four overarching changes affecting Baltic Sea environmental governance took place in the following two decades. First, the liberation of the Baltic states and democratisation of Poland sparked off extensive bilateral support programmes from primarily Sweden, Finland and Denmark (Hassler 2003a). These programmes often involved governmental actors, such as municipalities and county boards, as well as non-governmental actors, for example, CECAMS (Centre for Environmental Science and Management) and Environmental Consultancy and Monitoring Centre, both from Latvia.2 In order to establish collaborative schemes, twinning agreements were made between donor and recipient countries (Hassler et al. 2011). In these agreements, a public authority or private company in the donor country collaborated with a counterpart in the recipient country in order to stimulate transfer of knowledge and know-how (Hassler et al. 2011). Financing was typically secured through government funds or international financial institutions such as NEFCO (Nordic Environment Finance Corporation), EBRD (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and IBRD (the World Bank). In addition to these collaborative schemes, transnational initiatives were taken, such as collaboration among political parties, labour unions, NGOs and sector organisations. For example, political parties in Sweden and Finland collaborated with sister organisations in the Baltic states, and labour unions similarly had projects targeting areas such as gender equality and workplace democracy. Typically, these undertakings were partly financed by public sources (Hassler 2003a). Taken together, these new forms of interaction all contributed to"

Involving stakeholders is critical to the success of the scenario process, as well as improving the acceptance and validity of the model and creating ownership of the process. As such, the scenario workshops are a key component of the stakeholder engagement within the research. It is intended that the scenarios are adaptive and continue to be iterated as new data and knowledge becomes available. The scenario development processes highlighted a number of future challenges. Identifying trends in socio-economic processes with multiple interactions and dependencies is severely limited by the current capacity to understand and represent these processes, particularly in a quantitative way (Berkhout et al. 2002; Swart et al. 2004). This is further compounded by the range of scales considered, from international cooperation and macroeconomic issues through to individual and household behaviour. Despite an increasing number of studies adopting interdisciplinary scenario development down to the regional scale, the majority of these remain focused on a sub-set of future changes (e.g. flood riskâHall et al. 2005), water resources (Soboll et al. 2011) and land use change (Baker et al. 2004; Rounsevell et al. 2005; Audsley et al. 2006), with few addressing the extent of biophysical and socio-economic changes considered in this research. In particular, there is limited evaluation of socio-economic scenarios focusing on human wellbeing and poverty (LÃ¡zÃ¡r et al. 2015). This complexity creates a challenge for effective stakeholder engagement, requiring participants from multiple sectors with sufficient time to engage in the scenario process. The workshops identified that there was generally inadequate time in a single workshop to both sufficiently explain the overall context, as well as to allow stakeholders to discuss and respond to questions and invited feedback. Hence, multiple workshops and repeated engagement are critical to better engagement. Despite these challenges, continued engagement with stakeholders throughout the scenario process is successful in developing both qualitative and quantitative plausible futures. The process has assisted in promoting dialogue about the complex dynamics influencing changes in the natural and human environment and breaking down silos between those with different expertise."

118,344,0.305,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Developing a framework for a Cultural Risk Analysis, i.e. to carry out a cultural analysis, requires a paradigmatic shift in human consciousness similar to the one that took place in the Enlightenment. And this will be extremely difficult because it is a shift requiring both the rational (cognition) and the emotional (feeling). It will require both risk-as-analysis and risk-as-feelings; it will require both moral reasoning and emotional morals. As any good engineer knows (at least those who have taken my class), a redundant and diverse system has order of magnitude higher reliability if the system is built of âANDâ gates rather than âORâ gates.21 Perhaps Thomas Kuhn [34] said it best, ââ¦that is why a law that cannot even be demonstrated to one group of scientists may occasionally seem intuitive to others. Equally, it is why, before they can hope to communicate fully, one group or the other must experience the conversion we have been calling a paradigm shift.â And, âJust because it (a paradigm shift) is a transition between incommensurables, the transition between competing paradigms cannot be made a step at a time, forced by logic and neutral experience. Like the gestalt switch, it must occur all at once (though not necessarily in an instant) or not at all.â"
364,464,0.305,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract The current rate of human development poses a major threat to the ecological balance of the environment, and this is exacerbated by climate change effects. It is therefore important for people to understand the ecology of different locations so they can make informed decisions that will not have an adverse effect on the environment. In this regard, students form a significant group for whom sound ecological thinking is necessary as they will be the future leaders and decision makers who can ensure the worldâs continued sustainability. This chapter presents the results of an ecological education project that successfully expanded studentsâ ecological thinking. Evidence of this change is taken from interview responses before and after the ecological education project. The interview was based on a set of six photographs of different situations found in the environment. Responses were analyzed based on an ecological thinking framework developed by the researchers. This framework consisted of two components: understanding of ecology concepts and understanding of the impacts of human activity on ecosystems. The ecological education project succeeded in increasing studentsâ ecological thinking, thereby increasing their awareness of environmental risks.

284,394,0.305,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"This collection represents a milestone in the political ecology of environmental governance in Latin America. Given the enduring tension between the environment and development, its overarching purpose in my reading of the text is to elucidate the headway, obstacles and potential of our times to achieving the aspirations and goals of sustainable development, particularly in some of its early versions. Because this is a highly contested concept, and one that some of the contributors to this volume would most likely reject, I use it heuristically. It offers a platform from which to discuss the necessity of environmental governance that genuinely addresses environmental protection, social equity and broad-based political participation in the context of (largely) capitalist development; and this, in my view, is the central subject of the book. Much has changed in the world since the Brundtland Commission ï¬rst launched the idea of sustainable development in the mid-1980s: the end of the Soviet Bloc, free-market globalization, the rise of emerging market economies and profound transformations in manufacturing processes, just to name a few. Latin America transitioned to democratic governments, it beneï¬ted from sustained economic growth in the 2000s with some improvement in poverty alleviation, and it weathered a world recession. The region also witnessed an unexpected resurgence of the left. Left governments that would have been targets for decisive destabilization by the USA during the Cold War have successfully asserted their sovereignty, survived, and even thrived in some cases.

Climate change at its estimated pace poses serious challenges for society, policy, and the economy. In order to develop suitable strategies for adaptation, fundamental knowledge about the climate in the past, present, and potentially in the future is required on a global and a regional scale. Thus, a scientific assessment of observed and projected changes of climate variables and indices is an inevitable precondition for appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures. Because the terms âweatherâ and âclimateâ are often misunderstood, a few general definitions have to be explained first. While âweatherâ means the state of the atmosphere in a certain moment, hour, day, or week, âclimateâ is defined as the statistical description of weather, including averages and variability as well as the return intervals of extremes over a period of at least 30 years [defined by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)] (WMO 2011). The most relevant climate parameters characterising this period are surface variables- air temperature, precipitation, radiation, humidity, cloud cover and wind. Closely related to this definition I.

Rights-based approaches fill a major gap in the dominant discourse of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), as âIn practice IWRM has to a large degree neglected to directly address social equity issues and Human Rights Based Approaches can be seen as a methodology to strengthen such workâ (WGF 2012: 13). The High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition in their report on Water for Food Security and Nutrition examined the interlinkages between food security, water and nutrition in relation to the right to food and the current right to water for personal and domestic uses. One of the key recommendations is âPromoting a rights-based approach to water for food security and nutritionâ (HLPE 2015: 108). Scholars started exploring concrete implications of rights-based approaches for women, the poor and other marginalised groups. Hellum et al. (2015) invoked the right to non-discrimination in the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Recognising the indivisibility of rights and the importance of both domestic and productive uses of water for multifaceted wellbeing, they made the case for a gender-equal right to water for livelihoods (Hellum et al. 2015). In the remainder of this chapter, we will further examine concrete implications of closing the current gap between the state as duty bearer of human rights and the state as infrastructure-based water provider for both domestic and productive uses and as regulator in allocating water resources. The focus is on the most marginalised women and men in low- and middle-income countries, whose human rights to water are most severely violated. In the following, we first go back to the first milestone in connecting human rights and water management. This is the legal opinion on the human right to water by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), in its General Comment No. 15 of 2002 (UN CESCR 2003). This Comment prioritised water for drinking and other domestic uses and underpinned the Resolutions in 2010. However, as we will see in the next section, this Comment also clearly identified prioritisation in other dimensions of freshwater governance, in particular in infrastructure development and water allocation. Section 7.3 discusses rights-based approaches for the core function of the state of promoting infrastructure development, partly by own public investments in infrastructure and partly by promoting others to invest. Section 7.4 examines rightsbased state regulation in the quantitative allocation of water resources, as illustrated by experiences in South Africa. Section 7.5 draws conclusions."

99,94,0.304,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"The housing field also reflects the cityâs dominant discourse structure: Housing policy is mainly seen as an instrument for growth. The investment frame is again the dominant frame whereas social aspects play a minor role. Because of MÃ¼nsterâs political culture, important decision-makers have always been vigilant about prohibiting developments that might seriously endanger the social balance in the city. This argument leads to a request for a more âsustainableâ growth (prevention of market failure) and a call for caution about endangering the cityâs attractiveness through social cleavages. Since it is agreed upon that disrupting the cityâs social balance should be avoided, the need to improve the situation in already neglected neighbourhoods with reactive measures is relatively undisputed in the political arena and the general public. In this context, several experts refer to âhealthy mixesâ, understood as a mixture of different social groups inhabiting an area. They assume that if there is no such mix, people will be less likely to identify with their neighbourhood and owners will not invest in the housing stock as it may not pay off. âSustainable neighbourhood developmentâ, a preventative âspatialâ social policy, does not seem to be heavily disputed within the city context. A general need for sustainable neighbourhood development, a âhealthy mixâ of inhabitants and the need for affordable living spaces seem to be widely acknowledged by all actors involved, although the means to reach these goals are not agreed on since they are based on different problem analyses. In consequence, the question of how the lack of affordable housing shall or could be countervailed is clearly the main line of public political dispute in the field. With regard to local political actors, the controversies run along traditional party lines, between investment and social perspectives. The administrationâs role is criticized since it sides with market proponents, emphasizing that public housing cannot create enough affordable accommodation (VÃ¶lker 2011).13 Local authorities think it is more âuseful to support lower income tenants with accommodation allowances.â14 The strength of the market thus remains the dominant line of argu-"

230,610,0.304,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.5 Conclusions Marine litter is a complex problem to address, which exerts significant economic costs, often borne not by the polluter but by coastal and marine industries such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, etc. (some of which also contribute significantly to marine litter). Economic instruments have a potentially important role to play in addressing marine litter, with initiatives in place in several countries proving that they can lead to significant reductions in waste entering the environment (ten Brink et al. 2009). The development of effective and efficient instruments requires a strong link between the behavior change driven by the instrument and the harm caused by marine litter. However, there are several areas where there is a lack of sufficient information to make this link. At the heart of this is the problem of understanding the harm caused by marine litter. The harm caused by some forms of litter is known, however, there are large gaps in this understanding. While the presence of litter in the marine environment and even its ingestion, etc., in species is documented, it is not clear what impact it is having on critical populations of marine organisms or indeed species higher up the food chain (including humans). Further, while some specific types of litter are identified as having some impacts (discarded nets, plastic bags, etc.), the impacts of other types of litter are currently poorly understood, which is most notable with the debate on micro- and nanoplastics. In relation to socio-economic impacts, impacts on tourism from beach litter are documented, but a quantitative link between the impact and levels of litter is poorly understood (Ballance et al. 2000). These links between types, quantities and sources of marine litter and their varied impacts are important to understand if targeted economic instruments are to be developed. Otherwise an instrument may lead to a reduction in litter, but with a limited reduction in impact."

These four interrelated elements need to be coordinated within and across sectors and multiple levels for the system to work effectively and effective feedback mechanisms need to be in place for continuous improvement. Failure in one component, or lack of coordination across them, could lead to the failure of the whole systemâa critical issue since an EWS that does not warn effectively will not be trusted (Golnaraghi 2012). EWS can be developed for speciï¬c hazards and speciï¬c consequences or for multiple hazards and a range of impacts. The latter are termed MHEWSâa concept that is relatively newâand currently deï¬ned (UNISDR 2016b) as EWS which are designed to be used in multi-hazard contexts where hazardous events may occur alone, simultaneously or cumulatively over time, and taking into account the potential interrelated effects. A MHEWS with the ability to warn of one or more hazards increases the efï¬ciency and consistency of warnings through coordinated and compatible mechanisms and capacities, involving multiple disciplines for updated and accurate hazards identiï¬cation, mapping and monitoring and dissemination of warnings from various sources with a âsingle authoritative voiceâ and through standardized formats, codes and deï¬nitions. They may also involve international cooperation to address transboundary risks, such as floods, epidemics and the release of hazardous materials into the air or water. MHEWS, therefore, build synergies for data collection, analysis and operational management, thus enhancing cooperation, efï¬ciency and effectiveness (Basher 2006). However, in practice and even in theory, there is no agreement what is meant by an EWS and its individual terms âearlyâ, âwarningâ or âsystemâ. The answers are highly contextual, depending on social settings and the hazards themselves. In general, âearlyâ indicates that a warning is provided in advance of a potential hazard event in order to allow for sufï¬cient time for preparatory actions Thus, the hazard-speciï¬c âlead timeâ becomes a crucial characteristic of the EWS. However, âearlyâ in terms of warning of possible climatic changes could mean 100 years in advance, whereas for a flash flood it could be less than an hour in advance. In some instances, the ï¬rst warnings can only be issued when the hazard has already materialised, e.g. for some tornadoes or after a potentially tsunami-generating earthquake. âwarningâ information supports decision-making dedicated to threats and hazards and their potential impacts based on thresholds and other, user-speciï¬c criteria. However, caution is advised since a warning can be understood as a general information category with no legal obligation or an authoritative message from a mandated national authority that triggers a speciï¬c protocol."

This could be explained by the fact that farmers had access to extension services mainly through farmersâ organizations. These findings confirm the usefulness of social capital in improving welfare as suggested by the literature (Ostrom and Ahn 2007; Ostrom 1994). More primary schools will lessen vulnerability to climate shocks. Indeed, the more the populations are literate, the more they will be able to obtain appropriate information regarding adapting to climate shocks. The impact of the percentage of households that have access to electricity is negative. This finding means that access to electricity is costly to the communities, and it reduces the share of financial means that is invested in adaptation strategies. However, the percentage of households that have access to electricity does not have a significant impact on vulnerability level, ceteris paribus."
169,28,0.304,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"History has been acknowledged for 20 years as an important research element for river management that has been applied, for example, to deï¬ne reference conditions and assess the level of degradation. The evolution of river uses and related ecological conditions, especially in recent decades, has been utilized to show the impact of humans on these ecosystems. Integrating a historical perspective into river management can, however, go beyond these targets (see, e.g., Haidvogl et al. 2014, 2015; Higgs et al. 2014). Just as present river management decisions will inï¬uence future conditions, paths trodden by users in the past have a bearing on todayâs ecology. Sound long-term studies of the natural and societal drivers shaping historical river changes can thus support our understanding of the present situation and identify trajectories of change. In long-term studies taking into account the dynamics of natural forcesâin particular climate change and subsequent altered hydrologic and temperature conditionsâas well as social dynamics (e.g., decision-making processes, main energy sources and technologies, superordinated practices and values) can reveal distinct overarching patterns of river use and management. This can contribute to developing future strategies and plans with lower ecological impacts. This chapter describes major milestones of human river uses and ecological impacts. With some brief mention of Asian river case studies, it highlights especially examples, which are representative of industrialized countries of Europe and North America. In Europe, larger environmental changes of aquatic ecosystems occurred already in ancient and medieval times. European colonists spread practices and techniques of river uses to other areas of the industrialized world after they reached"

10,381,0.304,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"As the Visit Somerset website (www.visitsomerset.co.ukâJune 2015) describes: âThe Internationally important Somerset Levels and Moors form a unique patchwork landscape steeped in history and brimming with rare wildlife. Today the area is mostly grassland and arable with willow grown commerciallyâ. Not surprisingly, with its rich wildlife, including the largest lowland population of breeding wading birds, the area is specially protected and supports a number of protected areas. The quote shows both the important natural value of the area, and the fact that it currently is and historically has been used for human purposes. However, the area is vulnerable to both floods and droughts. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of both events. Water shortages due to prolonged droughts can be quite harmful for the wetlands, particularly habitat and peat loss. Agriculture and villages, however, are more afraid of flooding. After some years of severe drought in 2010â2012, a lengthy flood submerged much of the area in the winter of 2013â2014. The peat soils provide various ecosystem services not only for nature itself, but also for carbon storage, food production, and the protection of the historic environment. The impacts of dry periods can create irreversible changes, such as compaction and land subsidence, which not only decreases the buffer capacity of the land, but also increases flood risks down the line. The water authority of Vechtstromen produced analysis that concentrated on the Twente region. In the region, various nature areas suffer from desiccation in dry periods. About 90 % of the creeks run (almost) dry in the summer. Much of this region is dependent on rain and groundwater. While the area does not have one large designated nature area, it includes many valuable woods, heather ï¬elds and wetlands of various sizes in a mostly small-scale landscape. For this reason it was considered an ofï¬cial âNational Landscapeâ, and is, despite the termination of this national policy programme, still considered so by all regional actors involved. Due to climate change the annual water balance gets dryer affecting also groundwater levels. This in turn can influence river discharge while in dry summers creeks are often fed by groundwater. Not only in streams and their valleys, but also on higher ground nature will deteriorate with desiccation. The map below shows both the patchwork of existing nature areas and the areas in dotted green and yellow where even smaller spots of nature that are mingled with agriculture will be developed with a priority for nature. For most of these nature areas desiccation is a serious challenge, but often nitrogen from air pollution and farming is an even bigger one. The map also shows some main waterways in the rain and sometimes even groundwater fed creek system (Fig. 12.1). The development of drought resilience measures with farmers always has to cope with some distrust that nature development is restricting rather than codeveloping with farming, which can actually be true in some instances. The overview in this section shows that most areas involved in the DROP project do have drought sensitive nature areas, even though their nature and the extent to which they are threatened by droughts vary. While it is very hard to ï¬nd data on drought impacts on Flemish nature areas, given the characteristics of the area it is"
198,452,0.304,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"13.6.3 Context for Effectiveness There are three theories of change identified for the criterion of effectiveness. First one refers to the positive IO of a high level of adaptive capacity built and utilisation of adaptive measures. Contrary to the deterministic approach which automatically assumes the power of a mechanism (of generating an outcome) fully exercised regardless of context, realist approach pays close attention to the very structure wherein a mechanism is situated. For example, one contextual condition is the level of awareness of a local government partner. Local government partners can play a critical role in translating introduced adaptive measures and built adaptive capacity into actual benefits of the vulnerable people on the ground, such as rural farmers. If the introduced adaptive measures or built capacity is not clear to such partners, their utilization level can be quite limited. This refers to a case of Turkey where seasonal weather forecasts information provided over internet was introduced and related know-how taught. But since the end-users, e.g. rural farmers, were not reached, even though implementation theory may have held, the corresponding programme theory was not realized. Another contextual condition is where the types of adaptive capacity and adaptive measures are clear and well understood by those involved parties. In Namibia, the meteorological climate decision support tools were introduced to a government agency, but since the types of adaptive measures were not clear, introduced adaptive measures or built capacity did not generate a positive IO."
200,235,0.304,"Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Nuclear Risks","There were many deficits of nuclear risk governance in Japan before and after the Fukushima accident, as Taketoshi Taniguchi, the leading Japanese scholar in the field, illustrates by using the framework of ârisk governance deficits,â proposed by IRGC (International Risk Governance Council) [1, 2]. Not only were they created and embedded in the governance system before the Fukushima disaster, but it has been remained or even worsened after many accident reports were published and pointed out many problems which led the worst nuclear catastrophe in the history of Japanese nuclear utilization and suggested their recommendations to remedy them. In this paper, the author would analyze such remained problems found in the postaccident âon-site managementâ policy and measures, taking the case of contaminated water management at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. âOnsite managementâ includes many recovery works performed at the Fukushima Daiichi siteââstabilizationâ work in the language of the government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)âsuch as setting up building covers to limit the further dispersion of radioactive substances; reinforcing buildings feared to have lost structural strength due to the effects of hydrogen explosions; containing contaminated water with various concentrations of radioactive substances, generated as a result of continuous water injection and cooling; and collecting and transporting leftover spent fuel. It is one of the most difficult problems in the on-site management tasks mentioned above that the management of the highly radioactive contaminated water building up day by day. Due to various technical limitations, the temporary water injection and cooling system was built as not totally closed-cycle, and the damage caused by the accident allowed a huge amount of groundwater to flood the buildings. Inevitably, as the water gets contaminated with radioactive substances, highly radioactive contaminated water is continually produced. On top of this, since the path carrying the contaminated water to sea could not initially be identified or blocked, there were fears of marine pollution spreading. Regarding this contaminated water treatment at the Fukushima site, a series of âfollow-upâ measures have been taken and caused the delay of underground water pump-out. Finally, the âice wallâ project to block underground water intrusion seems to be failed. Failures result in the increase of total amount of contaminated water and further social distrust about the feasibility and progress of Fukushima decommission project in Fukushima residents, entire Japanese society, and international community. In the following sections, the author would describe the development of contaminated water management policy, measures, and institutional framework in chronological manner and then analyze the cause of their failure trajectory using a sociological concept âstructural disasterâ developed and suggested by Miwao Matsumoto, the pioneering sociologist of science who has shed light on the problems at the interfaces among science, technology and society, to understand"

There is no systematic attempt to encourage the involvement of institutional entrepreneurs, to develop such skills, or to look for cross-scale opportunities. All of this is left up to the challenger or innovator. Thus innovations may fail because of a lack of resources or because the innovator is not able to help tailor the innovation to its particular application. The two successful social innovations profiled on the site were achieved in partnership with The Economist magazine, which may have helped to raise the profile of the competitions. Innovation communities: Open Source Ecology Innovation communities do not promote innovation generally; rather, they focus on a single problem and attempt to find solutions to it. The emphasis in these groups is not on generating ideas but on fine-tuning them and seeing them successfully implemented. Unlike the other types of innovation platform, therefore, innovation communities rely heavily on their ability to coordinate action. This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. For example, although it is not an innovation community per se, Wikipedia has been very successful at coordinating large numbers of individuals in accomplishing a shared project by developing an elaborate set of rules and guidelines for evaluating articles, with a dedicated group of volunteer moderators who do most of the work of editing articles (Butler et al., 2008). In order to succeed, it needs to keep volunteers motivated and prevent fragmentation of the project (Hertel et al., 2003; Mustonen, 2003). Open Source Ecology (OSE) was born from the frustration experienced by one man: farmer, technologist and physicist Marcin Jakubowski. When he was unable to repair his brand tractor that broke down frequently, he designed a cheap, robust and easily repairable alternative that could be built entirely using locally available materials. He then made the blueprint for this new tractor available to the public. His work attracted outside attention and supporters and soon expanded into the vision of the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS), a set of blueprints for 50 machines that could be built and maintained locally on a small scale. Jakubowskiâs farm became the site of a community dedicated to producing blueprints and prototypes of these machines, and their work attracted the interest of others, like TED, who gave Jakubowski a platform to share his idea. Jakubowskiâs TED talk describing Open Source Ecology has had over a million views at the time of writing7 and helped launch a community on the global stage."

273,63,0.304,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"Driving forces can be classified into different types according to different criteria. According to the path by which various influencing factors take effect on ecological environment, they can be classified into direct driving force and indirect driving force. Direct driving force directly influence the course of ecological environment and is the physical, chemical and biological driving forces for changes in ecological environment and its services; we may identify and measure them by different accuracy. Direct driving forces include climate change, regional land utilization and land coverage change, species introduction or elimination, technological improvement and application, external input (such as fertilizer application, insect pest control, irrigation, etc.), various natural, physical and biological driving forces (such as volcanic mountain), harvest and resource consumption. Indirect driving forces have wider effects, often take effect by changing one or more direct driving forces; they are the different kinds of signals stimulating decision making process and thus their influence can be understood through how they affect the direct driving forces. Direct and indirect driving forces often produce synergistic effect. Indirect driving forces mainly include population driving force (such as population quantity, age and gender structure, educational level, spatial distribution), economic driving force (such as economic scale, structure of import and export), sociopolitical driving force (such as democratization, status of private social organization, mechanism for solving international frictions), cultural and religious driving force (such as choice of personal consumption concept), technological driving force (such as rate of investment in scientific research and development, rate of new technology adoption, status of development in biotechnology). According to if the various factors could be under the direct control of decision makers, driving force can be classified into internal and external driving force. Decision makers may change internal driving forces, but they canât change external forces; therefore, internal driving forces are under the direct control of decision makers, but external driving forces are not under their control. Decision is generally made via three levels of organization: local level (such as certain farmland or standing forest), regional level (municipal, provincial and national) and global level. The same influencing factor may show changing controllability at different level and different timeframe.17 Some of the influencing factors are exogenic and uncontrollable for decision makers at local level, but turn to be endogenic and controllable at regional level; for instance, national policies are uncontrollable for local government, but controllable for central government. Similarly, some other influencing factors are unchangeable and uncontrollable in short term, but changeable and controllable in the long term, such as technology, which can hardly achieve breakthroughs in short term but can be always changing from the long run. This book mainly addresses the driving forces at regional level. At this level, the internal driving forces of decision making generally include: various systems (such as property right system), service and commoditiesâ price and market, technological innovation,"

Japan also took the lead in the chapter on impacts and adaptation in Asia for the Third and Fourth reports by forming a research community for the same in the Asian region based on APN research funds. As the impacts of climate change vary from place to place, adaptation measures suited to each respective setting are needed, and such measures can be bolstered through shared experience. This was the concept behind the Asia Pacific Adaptation Network (APAN), which was proposed by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan and established in 2009 by a Thai prime ministerial declaration. This network is a forum for knowledge sharing between researchers, policymakers and experts engaged in the field of adaptation measures in Asian nations, and its activities are overseen by a secretariat in Bangkok. The influence of APAN as a role model of good practice has extended to other regions of the worldâthe creation in 2013 of the Global Adaptation Network (GAN) by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is one example. Developing Human Resources for Low-Carbon Policy Formation Since the 1980s, the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, in cooperation with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has focused its efforts on human resource development to support environmental research and policy in Asia. Results of such are the Environment Research and Training Centre (ERTC) created in Thailand in 1989, the Environmental Management Centre (EMC) in Indonesia in 1990 and the Sino-Japan Friendship Centre for Environmental Protection in 1990. Recognising the importance of Asiaâs response to climate change, JICA provided assistance for establishing the Climate Change International Technical and Training Centre (CITC) under Thailandâs Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organisation (TGO). This centre, which began operating in May 2014, conducts training for policymakers, experts and industry representatives from the ASEAN in the areas of GHG inventories, low-carbon societies, mitigation measures and technology and adaptation measures. Leading researchers from the ASEAN region of LoCARNet have advised on training content and participated in curriculum development and lectures.

Since these initial cases, ranaviruses have been linked to numerous epizootic mortality events in these three classes of lower vertebrate animals (Duffus et al. 2015). Although long-term population data are generally lacking, there is evidence that ranaviruses can cause population declines in amphibians (Teacher et al. 2010; Beebee 2012; Earl and Gray 2014; Price et al. 2014). Further, the nearly complete loss of entire age classes of fish and amphibians due to ranavirus outbreaks have been reported (Petranka et al. 2003; Todd-Thompson 2010; Waltzek et al. 2014; Wheelwright et al. 2014), and some species of global conservation concern are highly susceptible (Geng et al. 2010; Sutton et al. 2014a).

Similarly, the objective of sustainable development is one of the main foundations of a number of significant Reports issued by the United Nations Secretary-General, of which we will mention some of the most relevant for our purposes. Thus, the principle of sustainable development to a greater or lesser extent permeates the structure of the following documents: the United Nations Secretary-Generalâs Report on Marine Renewable Energies, 2012;8 the Climate Change Expert Groupâs Report on Renewable Energies, published some months previously;9 or the report on new and emerging technologies.10 Additionally, the United Nations General Assemblyâs open-ended informal consultative process on the Oceans and the Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS), whose mandate is precisely to deal with matters relating to oceans within the context of sustainable development, devoted its 13th meeting, held in 2012, to discussing above all the subject of marine renewable energies, with a focus that can generally considered to be highly positive.11 Within the sphere of the European Union, it should be remembered that along with its exclusive competence on conservation on marine biological resources,12 the EU also has shared competences on other aspects under the common fisheries policy, energy, environment or transport, amongst other fields that can be relevant here.13 In addition to this, sustainable development is a general and transversal goal,14 and in line with this the Integrated Maritime Policy is one of the EUâs vehicles for promoting the coherent adoption and coordination of decisions aimed at maximising sustainable development, economic growth and cohesion between Member States. Amongst the policies included under this umbrella are two with particular relevance for our case: blue growth and sea basin strategies, that for the Black Sea being included amongst the latter. In any event, it should also be borne in mind that the Black Sea basin is also a target for other EU policies and initiatives, which will be considered below; a case in point is the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), in which sustainable development is seen as a common value that partner States agree to accept.15 Remaining for the moment within the general sphere, it should be noted that blue growth has been an ever-present discourse within the European Union in recent years, but particularly since 2012, when the Commission drafted its"
378,242,0.303,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"For me it is not so much that we have to ï¬nd an alternative to freedom and prosperity, or even growth. We have to reclaim their meaning for a world with 9 billion instead of 1 billion people who have too little spiritual guidance rather than too much, and a degree of commodiï¬cation and homogenization in productive activities and consumption that limits need-satisfying possibilities rather than expanding them. In the midst of this, functioning as a great positive feedback for these trends, the next technological revolution, digitalization, is unfolding. With it comes an overturning of former standards of communication, speed, size, and reproducibility of goods and services. At the same time, knowledge and evidence about the dimensions of human impact on the pattern of oceans, greenery, and soils that make up the fragile ball of Earth has led to the emergence of a new term: the Anthropocene. The political, cultural and economic circumstances from which the Enlightenment movement sought liberation simply no longer exist. A Second Enlightenment in the twenty-ï¬rst century would seek liberation from very different types of totalitarianism and limitation to human potential. So which imaginary could progress, freedom, prosperity, and growth, the principles mentioned by Welzer, carry for the era of the Anthropocene? In my view both theory and practice reviewed in this book offer the tenets of the guiding ideas a Second Enlightenment could foster: â¢ Instead of being an output measured only by money, progress can mean the equitable and balanced progress of the whole SETS as measured by differentiated social, environmental, and cultural indicators. â¢ Instead of freedom meaning the absence of obstacles to individual purchasing desires, it can embody human security and sufï¬ciency: freedom from the fear of falling behind in the race for resource accumulation, and freedom from the culturally created endless want that impedes well-being. â¢ Instead of prosperity embodying ever more consumption choices, it can stand for a holistic and adaptive understanding of human needs and resilient access to diversiï¬ed need-satisï¬er strategies. â¢ Instead of economic growth being an end in itself, different types of economic output and activity grow, stay steady, or also de-grow as means to the end of securing well-being within Planetary Boundaries. Many of the SDGs and their targets speak to these principles, albeit with the exception of the dogmatic clinging to GDP growth and greater income for even the rich. Many say they are not speciï¬c or binding enough. But in system innovation strategies, it is more important to map where not to go (anymore) and then outline"

180,372,0.303,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"vulnerable is unclear. Further, by using the (V3) approach, attention is directed away from the underlying question of what vulnerability is; and instead, the focus is on whether or not to add a particular group to a continually expanding unstructured list of examples (Rogers et al. 2012). Of course, any such list might prove useful as an aide memoir during, for example, an emergency event. Such a pragmatic role may be useful, but it should not be mistaken for an ontological category or conceptual boundary. The (V3) approach has therefore met with the criticism that it is both too broad and too narrow to satisfactorily define vulnerability (Levine et al. 2004; Schroeder and Gefenas 2009; Luna 2009). Concerns about being too broad stem from the list of vulnerabilities becoming inflated to the point where âvirtually all potential human subjects are includedâ (Levine et al. 2004). As such, the same concern for (V2) applies to (V3), since both approaches fail to specify in sufficient detail those who need additional or special protection from harms. (V3) is also, potentially, too narrow because it focuses all attention onto specific or group characteristics and therefore fails to address concerns outside the particular designated categories (Rogers et al. 2012). It will, therefore, potentially miscategorize certain individuals or groups as not being vulnerable if, for example, they are a group that has not been encountered previously or if some trait has not made it onto the list of specified characteristics. Moreover, by focusing on specific or group characteristics, (V3) can stereotype individuals who fall under category headings (Scully 2013). If, for example, we assign names to different categories of vulnerability (e.g., âthe elderlyâ, âthe disabled,â or âwomen,â or âthe poorâ as categories of vulnerability), then many people could be classified as vulnerable without them necessarily being at any greater risk of harm."
72,57,0.303,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"about through struggle and changing the dominant cognitive frames that frame social issues. Such activity typically comes up against strong vested interests and can encounter (sometimes violent) resistance. As a consequence, the politicisation of social innovation research offers an important new lens through which systemic change can be understood: recognising the political dimension of social innovation is not merely a research opportunity, but it also raises significant practical questions and challenges. Political action often prompts a reaction and can lead to institutional confrontation or even danger. Further, when social innovation addresses public welfare issues or aims to drive political change, it typically does so as private action that lacks any formal democratic legitimacy. This is particularly problematic in cases where social innovation acts as a âshadow stateâ substituting for what would otherwise be the welfare responsibilities of the elected state. Such a democratic deficit challenges rights-based models of citizensâ relationship to their government. There is also the more general issue of who is included in, and who is excluded from, social innovation impacts. A second issue concerns the public legitimacy of social innovation. Many social innovations that aim to address institutional voids may initially lack legitimacy to key populations. This is because they often take the form of interventions that combine otherwise distinct institutional logics and models of action in innovative forms and that challenge normative notions of the roles and responsibilities of the discrete sectors. Such hybrid forms of action typically blend the logics and rationales of two or more established sectors to build new organisational structures (i.e., âsocialâ business), processes (i.e., work integration models) or goods and services (i.e., user-led welfare models) that correspond to complex sets of needs and demands in late modern societies better than conventional interventions do. The logics and rationales of action of each conventional sector are quite different and even contradictory at the normative level. As a consequence, the public legitimacy of social innovation (at both normative and cognitive levels: see Suchman, 1995) can often be compromised, with new models variously seen as attempts to privatise the social, dismantle the state or undermine civil society (Nicholls and Cho, 2006). The reaction to the social enterprise/social business hybrid model within social innovation has been particularly hostile since this challenges fundamental principles of the state and civil society as not-for-profit sectors in many countries. Such loss of public legitimacy can have serious consequences in terms of access to resources, market competitiveness, policy support and staff recruitment."

In any event, we could bend over and cradle the gars, successfully lifting them out of the water. There are cases where crustaceans can transmit viruses and other pathogenic agents to their hosts. One such case discussed earlier (Section 14.4.1.2) suggests internal lymphocystis virus in the silver perch being transmitted from a skin infection through gill lesions produced by the cymothoid Livoneca ovalis. The taxonomy of the Livoneca redmanii-ovalis complex needs attention, but the Gulf species is common in the Gulf and infests a wide range of hosts. Figure 14.51 shows a lane snapper, Lutjanus synagris, from off Horn Island, Mississippi, with a typically exposed specimen. Usually a single specimen occurs on the gills, and the effect that individual has on the host or the population is difficult to establish. Blaylock and Overstreet (2002), however, provided photographs (Figures 12.38 and 12.39 from Blaylock and Overstreet (2002)) showing six individuals causing a flaring of the operculae and heavily eroded gill filaments of an anemic year-old juvenile spotted seatrout in Mississippi. Livoneca ovalis (most likely a separate species of the Livoneca redmanii-ovalis complex) was noted by both Pearson (1929) for seatrout from Texas and Overstreet (1983a) for seatrout from Mississippi to occur on runted fish during their first 2 years and was more than likely to cause a gradual mortality of those fish. The infested spotted seatrout in Mississippi ranged between 10 and 17 cm (4â7 in) in length from November through May and often hosted two specimens of the isopod. The same species also caused extensive erosion of the gills of juvenile red drum in Mississippi marshes (Overstreet 1983b). Cymothoids are also known to cause mass mortalities in cultured fish, but the majority of cases involve fishes infested by cymothoids that are not on their natural hosts (Smit et al. 2014). Careful field and laboratory studies in the Great Barrier Reef on the cymothoid Anilocra pomacentri attached laterally on the pomacentrid reef fish Chromis nitida demonstrated an association often thought to be relatively harmless because the isopod stays attached for a long period. However, observations on a single cohort of fish showed the significantly depressed growth, reproduction, and survivorship of the infested fish. A parasitized female fish produced only 12 % of the number of eggs produced by a non-parasitized counterpart of the same size. Mortality of juvenile fish was estimated to be 88 % relative to 66 % during the first 70 days after recruitment. Within 48 h of attachment, the isopod penetrates through the skin into the muscle (Adlard and Lester 1995). In laboratory trials, fish mortality from infestation ranged from 78 % for small fish compared with 28 % for larger fish within 4 days of experimental infestation (Adlard and Lester 1994). Most cymothoid life cycles have been based on speculation; two have been described with considerable detail: Glossobius hemiramphi from the ballyhoo, Hemiramphus brasiliensis, from South Florida (Bakenhaster et al. 2006) and A. pomacentri mentioned above from Australia (Adlard and Lester 1995). The final marsupial stage on the female known as a manca immediately swims to the appropriate final host and develops into a male. Then in turn, this protandric hermaphrodite develops into a female, which feeds heavily on host blood, apparently only during periods related to onset of vitellogenesis. The adult female occupies the buccal cavity of the ballyhoo or externally dorsal and posterior to one of the eyes of the chromis. Some other species probably differ because juvenile stages have been collected from hosts other than the recognized final host. Another of the several Gulf cymothoids that attracts attention of biologists is Olencira praegustator, a species that infests the tongue of the Gulf menhaden. Guthrie and Kroger (1974) point out that their data, which also covers infestations of the Atlantic menhaden along the Atlantic coast, suggest that injured or infested adult menhaden school with juvenile menhaden in estuarine nursery areas rather than with their own year-class of fish in offshore waters. When enough infested individuals were present, they formed schools independent of"
271,42,0.303,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"and Gogolok in this volume). Reflecting both these aspects, across the variety of possible consequences we can assume that differentiation might result in an optionality (Rusch 2006) of ways of use. These can be related to processes of individualization (Hasebrink 1999) and, following from this, contingency within and across social domains and related questions of inequality and power. This can have various further influences on the segmentations, exclusions and divides articulated in a specific social domain (van Deursen and Helsper 2015; Nieminen 2016). For example, an increasing number of media as contents and technologies might weaken (as our preliminary research shows) the binding power of communicative practices within communities (Marszolek and Robel 2016), and the variability of possible contacts might increase (Friemel 2013). This may be especially discussed in relation to internet-based contact platforms, which are understood as supporting âweak tiesâ instead of âstrongâ relations within the direct living environment (Wittel 2008; Rainie and Wellman 2012: 131â134). The media environment of deep mediatization is characterized by the trends of an intensified connectivity. By connectivity, we primarily mean the interconnectedness of various media owing to their digitalization and the infrastructure of the internet. This is the case for âoldâ media such as television and the digital press, but increasingly and with reference to personal communication for ânewâ media such as online platforms and mobile phone applications. As a consequence, there is a close relationship between more recent processes of mediatization and globalization (Krotz 2008). A characteristic of contemporary everyday life is our ability to socially connect globally, across various media, if we want to. But, ââconnectivityâ does not necessarily mean âsocial connectednessââ (van Dijck 2013: 4). Increasing media connectivity can result in a spatial extension of processes of construction (Wessler and BrÃ¼ggemann 2012: 119â136; Hepp 2015: 13â18), and through that social domains can extend and their borders become blurred. This might âdisembedâ (Giddens 1990: 20) social processes being maintained across large distances. For example, it can become easier to build networks for learning over long distances (Thomas and Brown 2011: 53; Ito et al. 2009: 213), popular cultures can exist transnationally (Buckingham and Kehily 2014) and whole organizations or networks of organizations can be built up across various locations (Breiter 2003; Ribes et al. 2013; Lammers and Jackson 2014: 33â47; Jarke 2015)âall of this held together by technologically based communication. However, we must be careful in"

170,85,0.303,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"1.2 Contradictions In the past, ICT4D programmes have tried to address the lack of evidence-based impact studies by strengthening capacities for research. However, increased capacity in the conduct of disciplined inquiry responds to methodological challenges only, not to the substantive. The substantive challenge involves addressing the innate contradictions encountered when embarking on information society impact research. The first of these contradictions deals with the dual nature of information society. By 2005, the international development assistance community had seen it fit to classify development programmes under two major categories: sectors and themes. Sectors include agriculture, health, education, environment, natural resources, etc. Themes involve crosscutting concerns such as governance, gender, poverty, sustainability, and climate change. When situated within the development arena, the information society is both a sector and a theme. Its sectoral dimension covers hardware design, software development, infrastructure expansion, universal access, information and communication policy, and knowledge products and services. Its thematic nature, on the other hand, is manifested in its crosscutting applications. ICT4D may be applied in any development sector. When used in agriculture, it becomes eAgriculture; in health, it may take the form of telemedicine; in education, it is referred to as ICT4E; and in the environment, its major application is geospatial information systems (GIS). Generally, when assessing development performance, programme evaluators would consider ICTs as belonging to a different sector altogether (information technology or telecommunications) and, hence, beyond their purview and concern. Although ICT impacts significantly on these programmes, sectoral evaluations tend to class it along with other control (i.e. ceteris paribus) variables and, thus, not sufficiently looked into. A second contradiction deals with the fact that information society impact cannot be disaggregated from outcomes generated by purely sectoral interventions. To be fair, information society impact research has been conducted early on (e.g. Batchelor 2003, 2006, Batchelor and Norrish 2005) and widely enough (see Heeks and Molla 2009). Proponents submit that the difficulty in establishing a direct link between information society and the MDGs is not due to the lack of impact evidence but to difficulties in disaggregating and attributing such impacts to ICTs alone. For instance, it is difficult to sift through macro-level economic data and directly link ICT interventions to significant change in income, equity, or environmental quality indicators. Information society impact may be somewhat likened to a coefficient whose exact value cannot be factored separately from a given product. A postmodernist would refer to this contradiction as the invisibility of information society within the development arena."

Inversely, the lower the level of government, the more difficult it is to effectively address water governance problems, in particular those that are not strictly local, without having the big picture. Stakeholder engagement can provide platforms to address the mismatch between administrative and hydrological scales. Water-related projects and policies can be driven by local livelihoods tied to local ecosystems or by energy producers making long-term production and investment choices at the national level. Thus, some stakeholders promote hydrological scales that correspond to manageable units in which they operate (e.g. river basin organisations). Others promote conventional administrative levels, arguing that this is where capacity, accountability and legitimacy already exist. In the Great Lakes region of North America, multilevel engagement processes on water resource management between the province of Ontario, municipalities, local NGOs and First Nation communities led to the formulation of common policy directions and long-term strategies for water protection. Fitting stakeholder engagement to place-based needs can help reconcile decisions within and across spatial scales."

It follows that âproject successâ is a multifaceted term that can be measured in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions, expanded economic opportunities within the host country, improved local health outcomes or even in terms of social ideals such as increased gender equity or enhanced participation in decision making processes. The promise of âwin-winâ outcomes associated with environment and development projects is readily critiqued (Visseren-Hamakers et al. 2012; Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016). To add further to the conceptual tangle, the success of the project is contingent upon the householdâs willingness to utilize the technology, a behavioral feature that involves considerations such as cultural appropriateness (Troncoso et al. 2007; Shankar et al. 2014), intra-household dynamics (Shankar et al. 2014), and aftercare (Levine et al. 2013). Globally, Wang et al. (2015) tracked 277 cookstoves, 134 biodigesters projects and 11 water filter projects that were either preparing for registration, registered, or issuing credits with both CDM and other voluntary standards as of June 2014 (Wang et al. 2015). Of this total, 112 projects had issued credits at least once and 222 projects were registered, with the remaining 88 projects in various stages of preparation (idem). Given that these carbon projects have multiple goals, it is likely that evaluations for their âsuccessâ can differ greatly, depending on the goal of interest. The likelihood of unintended negative consequences resulting from a development intervention have been well documented in the general development literature (Ferguson 1994; Scott 1998) and in specific assessments of carbon credit projects. However, existing studies tend to focus on the theoretical merits and pitfalls of market-based approaches either by providing a global assessment of the market (Abadie et al. 2012; Kossoy and Guigon 2012; Climate Policy Initiative 2014; Climate Funds Update 2016) or by utilizing illustrative case studies to bolster a position on the carbon marketâs merits in general (Haya 2007; Bumpus and Cole 2010) or that achieving climate and development co-benefits is context dependent (Simon et al. 2012). Rather than condemn or condone carbon markets as a concept, there is a need to uncover causal mechanisms that can explain variations in development outcomes between carbon project types and designs."

The human spirit follows natural patterns between relaxation and stress, as we have seen in our medical research into heart rate variability. But our economy only follows the single pattern of relaxation and has no mechanism for stress other than its own collapse. To compensate for this, a dual economic system needs to be put in place, one of both transaction (relaxation) and transformation (stress), representing continuous interaction within a community that can keep it alive and progressive.

99,15,0.303,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"ic method, but simultaneously characterised by an indeterminate quality that makes it adaptable to a variety of situations and flexible enough to follow the twists and turns of policy, that everyday politics sometimes make necessaryâ (European Commission 2013, p. 16). Indeed, it has achieved the status of a buzzword in national and European policy circles. US President Obama established no less than two offices for social innovation. The EU has used the term to fund several initiatives, including the research project upon which this book is based. It is then little wonder that the meaning has diluted, sometimes referring to anything that is considered new and that is not technical. Although as an academic concept, it is less wide-ranging, there still remains a broad range of interpretations. Some posit simply that it must constitute a new approach to a particular kind of problem. The Stanford Centre for Social Innovation, for example, describes it as âthe process of inventing, securing support for, and implementing novel solutions to social needs and problemsâ (Phillis et al. 2008, p. 34). This is a conveniently flexible interpretation, yet one could argue that, according to this definition, there is little that does not qualify as a social innovation. Other scholars are more specific in circumscribing the nature of innovation. For example, the SOCIAL POLIS project defined it as âthe satisfaction of alienated human needs through the transformation of social relations: transformations which âimproveâ the governance systems that guide and regulate the allocation of goods and services meant to satisfy those needs, and which establish new governance structures and organizations (discussion forums, political decision-making systems, etc.)â (Moulaert 2010, 2013). This implies not only that an innovation must be radical (transformative), but also that it changes the power structure within the system where it is introduced. The problem with this kind of definition is less with its normative character, but with its essentialist nature. It is true that innovations are about new ideas and purposes deriving from established paths and patterns getting practical; however, it must be likewise considered that they are about processes and ways of development under conditions and in contexts where interaction is not determined and foreseeable ex ante. Innovatory effects of a new product, strategy or service can be path breaking to different degrees. Thinking this way it becomes clear that what is needed is a concept of social innovation as a complex societal process, rather than a mere classificatory definition of an action or product. For the purposes of the WILCO project, we defined social innovation as both products and processes; ideas translated into practical approaches; new in the context where they appear. It was important for us to use such a definition, rather than a more specific one, because one cannot clearly predict what comes out of even a very promising innovation in the course of its development. The problem with defining social innovation resides less in âinnovationâ and much more in the meaning one attributes to âsocialâ. Studying the current literature on conceptualising and defining social innovations, one finds that âsocialâ is mainly equated with âimprovementâ (Phillis 2008), finding better answers to basic needs and more satisfying social relations (Moulaert 2010), and a range of other âgood thingsâ. One way of challenging such an interpretation of âsocialâ has been proposed by Johnson in his essay asking âWhere good ideas come fromâ (2010).

Climate uncertainty is one piece of information input to the policy process to help determine the built infrastructure. Other inputs would include population changes and the economics of building and maintaining the infrastructure: reservoirs, aqueducts, and pumping stations. The projections from climate models might be of sufï¬cient certainty to motivate policy changes, such as managing seasonal runoff from high mountains in order to beneï¬t human and natural systems. The long lead times to form, approve, permit, and implement a water system allow for both the accumulation of additional observational evidence as well as the improvement of modelsâto inform actual speciï¬cation of evolving infrastructure. Each problem has its own unique requirements on uncertainty, and these requirements can simplify the inherent complexity of the uncertainty sources. At least the analysis can reveal the key uncertainties. For example, a problem to be addressed in the next two decades, with a solution needed to function for the two decades after implementation (i.e., a lifetime in the next 40 years), has relatively little sensitivity to the carbon dioxide emission scenario. A problem requiring speciï¬c knowledge of Arctic sea ice in the next 20 years relies on model components that have strong sensitivity to the initial state (ocean currents), a rapidly changing physical environment (melting ice changes radiative forcing), and complex multi-scale physics that are not especially well represented (see discussion in Chap. 11, and Fig. 11.6). The more speciï¬c the application, the easier it might be to characterize the key uncertainties. If the application is to estimate sea ice to determine the feasibility of shipping routes in certain seasons in the Arctic, then the key features are narrowed to a season, and perhaps a particular threshold (sea-ice thickness less than some threshold for which an icebreaker is available). This might lead to speciï¬c uncertain processes that govern sea ice in particular seasons. Instead of looking at all available model simulations with large uncertainty (see Fig. 11.6), a subset of models could be used. The subset of models would contain those models with a good current sea-ice thickness in a particular season. Therefore, a productive way is to step back and focus on the state of the knowledge in Fig. 11.1. This ultimately relies on fundamentals of the scientiï¬c methodâobservations, theory, simulation; the emergence of consistency among these three pillars; and reproducibility by many investigators coming from different approaches and scientiï¬c techniques. The state of knowledge is different for different processes and phenomena. It is well established, for example, that sea level will rise as the planet warms up. Our knowledge of the amount of sea-level rise remains incomplete (see Chap. 11). One way to narrow the range of knowledge is to consider how fast ice might melt and increase sea level. Estimates of the physical timescale can be combined with timescales of planning, building, operations, and maintenance to narrow the range of the incomplete knowledge. In this scenario, competing explanations are of little consequence to practitioners. Placing the problem in"

No attempts are made to question the underlying epistemological biases of this logic or, put more simply, the fact that metrics have never worked and never will capture the âproblems and solutionsâ facing health systems in LMICs (or indeed the UK). Fundamentally, we are suffering from a form of myopia generated by the domination of medical science perspectives or knowledge paradigms which determine the diagnoses, the interventions and epistemological approaches to evaluation. The quest for statistical outcomes (ideally gained through the gold standard of randomised controlled trials) underpinned by the narrowing blinkers of systematic review restricts our ability to understand social processes. There is also a tendency within this paradigm to pathologise or patronise individuals whilst failing to understand the impact of structural constraints. Despite growing recognition of the importance of context, this is often in the form of lip service at best acknowledging it as a cluster of variables that we donât understand (as external ânoiseâ) or, at worst, rather than understanding and capturing its iterative quality, trying to insulate our interventions from it through vain or inappropriate attempts to control it. Trying to cleanse data through what feminist researchers have called a âsanitisation processâ (Harding 1987, 1991) will not generate cleaner facts. It will take us further away from the truth as the cleansing process strips data of its real value: of understanding the social processes that shape phenomenon. It may be that what we are swilling away in the efï¬uent is that which is of greatest value. This narrow conceptualisation of knowledge not only affects the approach to evaluation, but it also reproduces a partial understanding of knowledge mobilisation as an activity.

This axiological conflict is, for example, reflected by the most frequent migrant-related topoi/themes in the UK press, as listed by Hart (cf. Table 3.2), which, connected with the concept of physical or mental threat, are likely to generate fear and evoke strongly negative emotional responses towards migrants (Hart 2010, see also Richardson and Colombo 2013)."

36,393,0.302,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.3.3 Coronaviruses Bat coronaviruses were first identified from species of the genus Miniopterus (Poon et al. 2005), however, with unknown zoonotic potential. The most prominent coronavirus, the one causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was followed by a pandemic spread in humans after the first outbreak in China in 2002 (Rota et al. 2003). Soon after the outbreak, the virus was detected in masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in a market in Guangdong Province, where SARS was first reported (Guan et al. 2003). A survey of common wildlife species in the area identified bats to be the natural reservoir of SARS coronavirus, with viruses from bats showing greater genetic diversity than the ones isolated from other species, including humans (Li et al. 2005). Bats can regularly be found in markets in China, which makes direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans likely (Li et al. 2005).

The urban climate often differs from the surrounding rural countryside as it is generally more polluted, warmer, rainier and less windy (Givoni 1991). This suggests that the effect of climate change with the predicted increase in temperature and more extreme weather events will be experienced to a greater extent in urban areas compared to the surrounding landscape. The changing climate might also exaggerate the negative effects of urbanisation already experienced, such as increased urban temperatures and flooding (Semadeni-Davies et al. 2008). Still, increasing urban densities are seen as a way forward towards sustainable urban development. Across Europe, there is presently a trend for densification as a planning approach for sustainable development to foster efficient use of resources, efficient transport systems and a vibrant urban life (e.g. Haaland and van den Bosch 2015). Development often takes place on areas that are often viewed as underutilised land (such as green space) or through redevelopment on previous industrial estates (van der Waals 2000). However, this approach has also been challenged for its threat to urban green spaces (Haaland and van den Bosch 2015) since together with urban brown fields they potentially have an important role for offering climate change adaptation solutions. The creation, re-establishment, improvement and upkeep of existing vegetation systems and the development of an integrated urban green infrastructure network could provide a valuable asset, in which to incorporate establishment of new nature-based solutions (NBS) to deal with local effects on climate change. The dual inner urban development could here be seen as a constructive way forward (BfN 2008). The approach combines a densification of existing built-up areas with a mixture of conservation actions, thereby boosting the presence, quality and usability of green spaces and enhancing other green infrastructure such as street trees, green walls and roofs (BfN 2008). Within this chapter, we review (1) the general impacts and consequences of climate change for urban areas in Europe, (2) climate change adaptation possibilities using nature-based solutions (NBS) and (3) some challenges for planning and design for successful implementation of NBS within urban areas. The review focusses on urban temperatures and includes hydrological, ecological and social factors. The review is aimed at setting a baseline for future possible research on planning alternatives for climate change adaptation and providing general guidelines and support for the professional planning community working with climate change adaptation."

169,460,0.302,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The importance of goals and mental models to decision-making becomes clear if the AM cycle is expanded to try to account for the complexity of the policy world (Fig. 16.3). In the assessment phase, all factors in Fig. 16.2 are used to deï¬ne the problem (usually as a trend) and the pattern of likely causes. From the outset this is complicated by the fact that the nature of the problem itself is in question. Problems may have multiple interpretations, based on conï¬icting values and goals (Weick 1995). Even if the basis of a problem is relatively simple and clear, the goals and mental models of individuals and of the surrounding culture and politics will dominate how it is deï¬ned and interpreted. This is because goals and mental models act like a ï¬lter that determines what information is selected and how it is measured in evaluating policy performance or in decisions as to how policy is implemented. One example of this is the physics of increasing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is not complex. It can only cause more heat to be retained, and this reliably predicts why the years since 2000 have exhibited the hottest atmospheric temperatures ever measured. Yet many deny the evidence (that climate change exists at all) or the theory that society is driving it by generating more greenhouse gases. Political conservatives, who often ascribe to hierarchist or individualist paradigms, tend to deny climate change theory or evidence. Political liberals, who tend to subscribe to paradigms centered on community (communitarian) and social equality (egalitarian), tend to accept the science supporting climate change theory (Kahan 2008, 2013). However, both conservatives and liberals are equally likely to interpret data ideologically. There is a third, social and political, aspect involved. As Kahan (2013) concludes: â. . .ideologically motivated cognition . . .[is] a form of information processing that promotes individualsâ interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important afï¬nity groups.â Thus, while the perceived political and economic consequences of climate"
364,216,0.302,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Likewise in Malaysia land use changes occur due to expansion of palm oil production, and the changes exacerbate crises already caused by deforestation, ecosystem degradation, and biodiversity loss. The country currently faces serious issues involving the trade-off between oil-palm growth and maintenance of ecosystem services. Furthermore, many ecological risks have emerged in the agricultural sector, such as water supply shortages, soil erosion and fertility loss, water-logging effects, salinity, and mangrove conversion. In order to manage these ecological risks, the country instituted a range of legal and regulatory measures such as the National Environmental Policy, the National Conservation Strategy, the National Policy on Biological Diversity, and the Environmental Quality Act. In the Philippines, human-induced ecological risks occur due to land use changes in wetlands. Wetlands are important for both humans and birds. Although particular areas are set aside as bird sanctuaries by local governments with cooperation from local communities, there is growing pressure for cultivated wetland areas to meet the increasing needs of humans for food and fiber. To increase food production in cultivated areas more water is required, and this aggravates water pollution and soil erosion, while reducing carbon sequestration. Consequently, the pressure on cultivated areas reduces the level of ecosystem services. Like other countries, the Philippines is trying to balance agricultural production with supply of ecosystem services, but efforts to do so are affected by typhoons, drought, floods, and social unrest. To address the issues of ecological risks, the country has introduced a wide range of environmental laws and policies on land use management and agrarian reforms, with greater priority placed on community-based management. However, policies related to national land use are not on the agenda and this has caused confusion and conflicts on the part of implementing agencies and authorities. Recent expansion of bio-energy production, which has occurred indiscriminately and on a major scale, has resulted in new environmental obstacles, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Typically, the expansion of oil palm, coffee, or banana plantations has caused massive deforestation and a loss of biodiversity that could include precious genetic resources found only in tropical Asia. Ironically, CO2 emission in plantation crops occurs at a considerably higher rate than in the conventional crops and grains. Goda et al. (2006) have listed a number of negative externalities that ultimately result from human activities such as degradation, livestock production, and use of pesticides in agriculture. Due to population growth and rapid economic development, many Asian countries have increased agricultural food production. However, these human activities have resulted in extensive degradation of natural resources and the reduction of ecosystem services. In particular, the adoption of modern technology including intensive use of fertilizers and monoculture has caused serious soil and water degradation. For example, substantial soil degradation has resulted from deforestation (30 %), overcultivation (32 %), and overgrazing (26 %) occurring due to population growth and economic development in the Asian region. In Japan, the decrease in farmland area has caused various social problems. Due to both rapid urbanization and abandonment of farmland, ecosystem services from farmlands have been lost, resulting in more frequent occurrences of flooding in the"

He explained in his address to the AVEPM in 2002 that this unorthodox career progression was borne of his desire to combine veterinary practice and scientific research, and âto help people in need within poorly âdevelopedâ areas of the worldâ.27 It was in 1964, while undertaking consultancy work for the WHO Communicable Diseases Programme and researching the parasitic tapeworm E. granulosus at the AUB, that he published the first edition of his most famous work, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health (VMHH). A combination of textbook and magnum opus, VMHH was a product of an age in which (as described in Chapter 4) interactions between veterinarians and public health experts were increasing. It was intended to advance Schwabeâs view that âthe veterinarian possesses unique qualifications which can not only be increasingly directed to the investigation of human diseases, but also to their managementâ.28 Written with the support of a fulbright fellowship and grant from the WHO, the book did not use the term OM.

At a fundamental level, this is a challenge to the traditional dynamics of NorthSouth models of collaboration. The global flow of ideas in the realm of health is by no means new, though typically only tacitly acknowledged when flowing in âreverse.â Given the ever-present community-academic and North-South imbalances, the Pan Institution Network for Global Health (PINGH)1 employs a participatory governance and research approach to bring a balance of power by featuring local stakeholders as content and context experts. First, PINGH has a rotating governance structure. Each university partner has a champion who represents his/her institution for all PINGH activities. Second, leadership rotates on a three-year cycle. Each institution takes turns leading PINGH initiatives as well as hosting the annual PINGH collaborative meeting, in order to offer an opportunity for all PINGH members to experience and gain insight on the institutional and local cultures of each PINGH member and to defray costs of hosting the meeting for any one institution. These activities also insure participation and contribution from all PINGH members in the global North and South. To promote inclusivity, we invite community stakeholders to our annual meetings to ensure that PINGH objectives are relevant to the local communities in which PINGH institutional members serve. Local NGOs, government policy makers, and other local stakeholders have attended PINGH meetings to help our partners reflect and strategize on how global health research and capacity building can be translated to local policy and practice. Our approach to community stakeholder involvement is discussed in further detail in this chapter."

198,69,0.302,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"but provided evidence that gender turned out to be relevant after all. OPS5 concluded that âomitting attention for gender where it is needed may have led to unintended negative gender-related consequencesâ. A baseline study undertaken by OPS5 revealed that many climate action projects were formulated by experts insufficiently aware of gender issues. On the good side it should be noted that the same study also revealed projects that tackle gender issues adequately (GEF/IEO 2014, p. 61). When the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) started in 2008, they did not have an explicit gender focus â most countries did not include womenâs organisations in investment plan consultations. However, in 2009 and 2010, 15 % of the plans started declaring gender considerations. Some works remains to ensure that gender considerations are mainstreamed in CIF planning and carried through to investment projects in the field. In a positive step forward, the CIF hired a gender specialist to develop and implement an action plan to support collaboration among MDBs. Attempts have been made throughout the NICFI portfolio to address gender issues in REDDÃ¾. However, it is stated by the evaluation that among partners, there is a lack of understanding of, and low general capacity to address gender. The strongest contribution has been through the UN-REDD programme, whereby numerous publications on REDDÃ¾ and gender have been produced. For UN-REDD, the importance and need for gender mainstreaming is reflected in most of its policy and programmatic documents and guidelines. However, the implementation of gender mainstreaming activities at the country level is not taking place in a cohesive and systematic way throughout the programme. The evaluation (2014) stated that drivers of deforestation will be better addressed if gender considerations are integrated especially at the local level. The track record on equity and inclusiveness is even less impressive. While equity and inclusiveness are essential dimensions of social, economic and environmental sustainability, they are perhaps too far removed from the often technical nature of the climate actions reviewed in the seven comprehensive evaluations. The Fifth Overall Performance Study of the GEF does not mention equity or inclusiveness, while the CIF evaluation only mentions equity in relation to investments and inclusiveness of stakeholders in consultations. There is indirect attention to the issues â for example in the attention for local livelihoods, involvement of indigenous peoples and civil society organisations. An example is to be found in the NICFI evaluation: since 2008, NICFI provided a total of NOK 1 billion or 9 % of its funding to civil society to generate needed knowledge, for advocacy (international and political), piloting and facilitating implementation (Frechette etc. 2014, xix). UN-REDDâs evaluation stated that âThe Programme provides an enabling platform for Indigenous Peoples and civil society organisations to influence global discussions on REDDÃ¾. The ability of forest-dependent populations to influence REDDÃ¾ processes has so far proven to be more limited at the country level, and non-indigenous communities are not well represented in the programme, overallâ (Frechette etc. 2014, vi). While attention for gender, equity and inclusiveness is on the rise, the evaluative evidence is overwhelming that these dimensions have not yet been fully included in"
344,120,0.302,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"In all the oil simulations, oil production and refining capacity is increased and then gradually phased out to replicate the forecasted production path, which assumes peak production of about 210,000 barrels of oil per day between 2017 and 2025. The main objective in this study is not to compare the contributions of alternative oil production and revenue scenarios to the economy, but instead to evaluate economic and socioeconomic outcomes under alternative spending options. All oil simulations therefore assume the same oil production path and government revenue stream, but they differ in terms of how government saves or spends the revenue. A total of six oil scenarios are modeled. We elaborate below, and Table 1 summarizes. We start off with a set of basic investment scenarios where we assume all oil revenue is invested domestically, or, alternatively, part of oil revenue is invested and the balance is transferred to a foreign oil fund. Also included in this set of scenarios is one where part of the revenue is transferred to households in the form of a welfare grant. The first simulation, named FND00INV, is a typical Dutch Disease scenario. It assumes that all public revenue is immediately used to finance public infrastructure investment spending. This means none of the government oil revenue is saved abroad in a fund. In general, in this scenario, additional foreign exchange revenue from oil production and exportation increases national income, which is used by private and public agents for consumption (this is an endogenous effect) and investment (via increased private savings, or by design via the government closure selected). The latter increases the economyâs total capital stock until peak oil production is reached, but the increased public capital does not sustain significantly higher output over the entire simulation period, as the capital stock in the oil sector is subsequently reduced to replicate declining output as oil reserves are gradually depleted. The simulation therefore allows the pure demand-side effects of the price boom to be isolated: Absorptive capacity constraints are binding and the demand effects lead to a real appreciation and the typical restructuring of production observed during an oil boom. We start off with a set of basic investment scenarios where we assume all oil revenue is invested domestically, or, alternatively, part of oil revenue is invested and the balance is transferred to a foreign oil fund. Also included in this set of scenarios is one where part of the revenue is transferred to households in the form of a welfare grant.

237,93,0.302,The Academic Book of the Future,"However, the effects of academic books can be much more profound, producing transformative changes at the cultural level. To give a very brief and partial selection of examples, Newtonâs Principia Mathematica, Darwinâs Origin of Species, Marxâs Das Kapital, Greerâs The Female Eunuch, and Carsonâs Silent Spring profoundly changed our perception of the mechanics of the physical universe, the genesis of humanity, the effects of capitalist economics on society, the way that the sexes relate to one another, and the human effect on the environment. It is important to remember that texts such as these have never stood alone. Each author was able to draw upon centuries of existing intellectual discourse in written form, whilst also being able to debate their ideas with contemporaries. Readers continued to add to the debate long after publication, in both academic and public forums. Each text has become a node in a network of knowledge extending backwards and forwards in time, and crossing social and geographical boundaries. Over time (and with the help of academic libraries which continued to make them available), such texts have weathered controversy and strong opposition to become the foundation stones for todayâs cultural attitudes. In the digital world, academic texts are potentially more available to the public than ever before, with a corresponding potential for more immediate and wider effects on cultures and societies. It is now possible to publish and disseminate texts through a number of different channels, including Open Access formats that require no payment from the reader. It is also possible to access a book review or citation in one digital publication, or to be alerted to the existence of a book by a social media network, and then immediately download the full text of the work onto a mobile device, or order a print version online for delivery within a few hours. Online forums allow readers and authors to engage in debate surrounding the content, bringing it very swiftly to the attention of an expanding audience. Although wider access to books is facilitated by digital advancements, it can also be restrictive. The cultural influence of the academic book is not lost on governments and political groups that seek to control the perceptions and behaviours of populations. The banning and deliberate destruction of books and purging of libraries has occurred in different cultural contexts throughout the ages, as a means of imposing religious or political orthodoxies. In the digital arena, where there are no physical copies to purge, governments are able to restrict access to digital book content simply by preventing public internet access altogether, as in DOI: 10.1057/9781137595775.0016"

99,16,0.302,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"(a) the ideas of individual inventors working as or with businessmen, (b) ideas of individuals in society that may be taken up at different places, (c) market-networked innovations, generated by (clusters of) enterprises and their R&D departments and finally (d), what he calls âthe fourth quadrantâ (2010, p. 213), non-market/networked movements inventions and actions making them practical innovations. It is then not the more or less technical nature of an innovation, nor the degree to which its final (by)effects are beneficial, but the offspring from the realms of society and social interactions that might make a difference between innovations at large and social innovations. He also tries to show that in the last centuries, there has been a swing from individual and business based to what he calls ânon-market/networkedâ based (social) innovations. It would be tempting to discuss then in which ways there is a link between more social innovation and more civil society as a fertile ground for processes that generate and give room to such innovations. The view proposed by Johnson may allow a more subtle understanding of the prevailing broad consensus on the positive definition of the âsocialâ aspect of social innovation (see BEPA 2010; Mulgan 2006). They may not always be seen unanimously as good, but possibly as more promising or attractive than previous arrangements, or in comparison to the lifestyles created by the innovative products, services or regulations of big business and big government. While this allows us to feel sympathetic towards social innovations, we must still remain critical about statements and definitions that declare them as inherently good. Interpretations of the added value and success of social innovations, which reflect what is seen as good and better for society, will often be widely contested. By definition, innovations differ from prevailing routines, forms of thinking and acting. It is possible that they may become a mainstream practice, but this is never the case at the outset. They can be linked with a diverse range of goals and come to take on different meanings over time. Just as important as the initial goals of social innovation are wider political concepts and institutional systems in which they become embedded (see e.g. Osborne and Brown 2011), reactions of the social and economic environments, and the hopes for better coping strategies and solutions that they attract. The enormous impact of social environments for the shape and directions innovations take is a well known topic from the older and more established research and debates on technological innovations (see e.g. Chesbrough 2003). Basically all innovations, technological and social innovations, are, as convincingly argued by Nowotny (1997), marked by a high degree of risk and uncertainty in the course of their development. Altogether, this shows that defining innovationâand more specifically social innovationâis an issue in an evolving area of study undergoing a great deal of change and often linked with normative assumptions. Against this background, our definition avoids objectifying what is a matter of processes involving not only proponents and activists and their initial goals but also the ways contexts react and shape the ways and directions social innovations develop. We employed the simple criterion that social innovations are those that, created mainly by networks and joint action in social realms beyond business and government routines, at any given moment, raise the hope and expectations of progress towards something âbetterâ (a more socially sustainable/democratic/effective"
126,390,0.302,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"â¢ It has become commonplace among development specialists and researchers with extensive ï¬eld-based experience in some bilateral aid agencies (particularly in Scandinavia) and non-governmental organizations to regard cooperative investigation with communities as essential to the production of accurate, thorough and useful analysis of a regionâs socioeconomy and environmental status, as well as identiï¬cation of the local residents' most pressing needs. Multiple forms of community/investigator cooperative approaches to considering livelihood systems, natural resource use patterns in relation to possible development (or conservation) policies have transpired in ways that actually assist communities in improving their life circumstances, rather than undermine them. Local communities likely to be most affected by the development in question need to be included as active participants in all phases of impact assessments and related studies, including: âidentifying the socioeconomic and environmental parameters, or âboundingâ of the task at hand, âgathering information and data (ï¬eld derived components, at least), with ongoing interpretation, and âdrawing conclusions and summarizing the key issues derived from the effort, including their signiï¬cance for the future of local communities and their environment. Much has been learned about cooperative processes between external investigators and local communities that increase accurateness of results. In pastoral and agropastoral contexts, for example, it is clear that local participants need to be selected through dialogue with traditional leaders, rather than government appointed ones. Broad-based and community-held discussions are a critical component and these need to be held in all phases of the work and throughout the geographic area being considered. At community gatherings, local participants, including community leaders, male and female elders and both genders of youth need to actively engage in the above dimensions of the collective effort. Those community members involved in core roles of the investigation have a major roles in planning items for open community discussion and community feedback, while working closely on a daily basis with external investigators. The results from open meetings (as well as from âfeedback surveysâ, etc.) need to be incorporated into the ï¬nal assessment, or reportâincluding its summary and conclusions. Results and conclusions need to be made presented to communities prior to releasing them to policymakers and client institutions. Finally, all such documents must be fully transparent and available to the public. Constructive baseline studies and environmental/socioeconomic impact assessments (ESIAs) and the like need to be unrestricted in their ability to question the project or development approach in question, based upon its ï¬ndings. This contrasts sharply with the existing arrangement for the Omo basin projects detailed in Chap. 6, for example, where implementation of the project is presumed to be a result of the ESIAâa situation permitting opportunity only for âsuggestedâ after-the-fact mitigation or monitoring actions, or additional studies, while the project moved to completion. The Gibe III assessment scenario, unfortunately, is indication of the predominant pattern in assessment related study contractingâone involving major âreciprocityâ and ârevolving doorâ relationships. â¢ Changes in both perspective and method of this order obviously necessitate a signiï¬cant shift in accountability relations. Clearly, investigators have some basic accountability to those who contract them. Yet to assure a cooperative outcome, with accuracy of the work produced, they must also have genuine accountability to local communities which have sufï¬cient authority to ensure that the content and outcomes of investigation represent the realities of their lives and their environments, and authority to guarantee that their voice will be heard well beyond their immediate localitiesâin fact in the distant ofï¬ces of policymakers and politicians. It should be clear that global consulting industry corporations and individualsâparties well-equipped and experienced in accepting accountability only to their client institutions in a system that amounts to a âcontract treadmillâ and too often, a âcomplicity treadmillâ involving very large sums of money, are ill-equipped for such an orientation. â¢ A participatory, community-inclusive approach to studies and impact assessments for consideration of development programs is best implemented by non-governmental organizations, academics (research units or groups, individuals), relatively small consulting organizations, rather than by global consulting industry representatives. Lead investigators should be able to demonstrate qualiï¬cations including: âIn-depth familiarity with the geographic region concerned, including with substantive ï¬eld-based experience in the region or one closely paralleling it. âAppropriate professional training credentials in socioeconomic or human ecological (broadly deï¬ned) ï¬elds. âExperience and commitment to studies weighted to ï¬eld-based investigation rather than âdesk studiesâ with utilization of available printed information, etc., and brief ï¬eld âvisitsâ."
278,17,0.302,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"A sustainable future must lie within all three of the operating spaces in Fig. 1. Thus âsustainableâ living is represented by the region at the centre of the figure.

78,283,0.302,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"environment and, what is more, spontaneous orders evolve through such informational complexity. Although, in his seminal book The Sciences of the Artificial (new ed. 1996), Herbert Simon used to warn that complexity is âtoo general a subject to have much content,â he pinpointed cases where this approach to the complexity of the subject matter can particularly be fruitful: âparticularly classes of complex systems possessing strong properties that provide a fulcrum for theorizing and generalizing can serve as the foci of attentionâ (Simon 1996, p. 181). Here, we can start appreciating how the complexity of ICTs-driven societies affects canonical tenets of legal and political thought, in four different ways. Figure 1 helps me illustrate this informational approach to the complexity of current legal systems. First, the idea of the law as a set of rules enforced through the menace of physical sanctions ( e.g., Kelsen 1949) often falls short in coping with the new legal and political challenges of the information revolution: identity thefts, spamming, phishing, viruses, and cyber attacks have increased over the past decade, regardless of harsh national laws like the US anti-spam act from 2003. Furthermore, a number of issues, such as national security, cyber-terrorism, availability of resources and connectivity, are systemic, that is, they concern the whole infrastructure and environment of todayâs ICTs-driven societies and, thus, these issues have to be tackled at international and transnational levels. Unsurprisingly, national law-making activism is short of breath, and this is why constitutional powers of national governments have been joinedâand even replacedâby the network of competences and institutions summarized by the idea of governance. Leaving aside how this profound transformation affects the sovereignty of national states, much as democratic processes and models of political legitimacy, attention should be drawn to how often the modern stateâs monopoly of power and legitimate violence is over in this context. National sovereign states, although still relevant, should be conceived as one of the agents in âthe formation and stewardship of the formal and informal rules that regulate the public realm,â that is, how Hyden, Court and Mease define the notion of governance (in Grindle 2005, p. 14). Second, the scenario of ICTs-driven societies appears increasingly complex since the quantity of information grows and its theoretical compression decreases (Chaitin 2005). To be fair, this trend is not new: some have summed it up with the very process through which pre-modern communities converted into industrial and ICTs-related societies, up to current post-industrial, or ICTs-driven, societies (di Robilant 1973). Others have traced this complexity back to the emergence of"

Engineers should limit their work to convey all possible data in an honest way, with the expectation that other engineers will do the same in their respective fields and that the public or policy makers will listen to expertsâ analysis. However, these expectations are often unfulfilled. The creation of mixed figures such as policy makers with technological backgrounds could be a possible improvement. However, a division of roles in the decision making process between policy makers and engineers must be preserved to clearly identify who should have an unbiased scientific opinion and who should consider socio-political aspects during decision making."
376,279,0.301,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","ditionally considered variation only as a nuisance parameter that is only useful to calculate an accurate mean, rather than a critical parameter in itself. These factors have contributed to a scientific discipline that has tendencies to reduce variation and study small plots, rather than embracing variation and studying complex landscapes at multiple scales. Yet natural systems are subject to a host of biotic and abiotic processes that shape these landscapes ranging from broad-scale, long-term changes in climate to more localized, short-term events such as droughts, floods, and fires (Fig. 5.1). Over time these factors have created complex systems in nature with a high degree of spatiotemporal variability associated with topography, soils, climate, weather, and disturbance regimes overlain with a diversity of plant and animal communities. Consequently, management seeking to maintain homogeneity presents a major quandary, and often comes at substantial cost, because it is attempting to override the inherent heterogeneity of rangelands and the behavior of disturbances. Considerable money and energy are spent attempting to minimize heterogeneity. Rangeland managers have long sought to override variability in nature with management infrastructure (e.g., fencing, water provisioning) and by controlling disturbances (e.g., channeling or damming water courses and suppressing fires). Despite these efforts, disturbances such as fire, flooding, and drought continue to create variation in systems managed for equilibrium, although the variability is structured differently. This has led to a prevailing view that such disturbances are destructive threats to production systems."

However, the bidonvilles were not officially acknowledged or reported in the press until the mid-1950s (Bernardot 1997; Hmed 2006). At that time the uppermost estimates put the total population in the shantytowns at 25,000 (Bernardot 1997). Contemporary scholars, however, put the true figure between 200,000 and 300,000 people (Power 1993; Lallaoui 1993: 44â5; in Bernardot 1997). Atouf (2002) cites sources which estimate that one third of all North Africans in France were living in slums or shantytowns as of 1953. The housing crisis became a major preoccupation of the French government and the press somewhat later, in the mid-1950s, as my research at the Sciences-Po Press Archive underlined. A 1958 article in the newspaper La Croix is not unrepresentative of the moral panic which slum housing provoked: In the matter of housing, [France] presents the undeniable characteristics of a prerevolutionary state. There exists now, in this country, the seeds of a revolt, sown and nurtured in the inhuman constraints of the slums.

Many planning and management activities have small spatial scales and timescales of the next three to ï¬ve decades; thus, the choice of emissions scenario is less important and the representation of internal variability is more important. Large model uncertainty argues strongly for intensive speciï¬c evaluation of model uncertainty (e.g., if the issue is snowpack, is the current temperature correct in the model?) or even the use of multiple models (multiple-model ensembles). Scenario uncertainty is also associated with the impacts side of the problem. Recall the example of the impact of tropical cyclones on a coastline. That impact will change over time with the built environment, as well as with changes in cyclones. So the scenario for practitioners may also include aspects of the human or natural system impacts that are not treated by the climate model. One difï¬culty is consistency: If impact scenarios are estimated, like the built environment on a coastline, they should be consistent with the climate scenarios. The human side of the problem may matter between different scenarios, even if the climate projection is similar, as in the case for the example of the built environment around a coastline. Even if cyclones do not signiï¬cantly change in 30â50 years, the built environment might very well change. The human narrative in scenarios for climate prediction is evolving in 2015, and the current versions of climate scenarios (beyond the RCPs that predict emissions) are called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).7 These scenarios contain not just emissions, but also the growth assumptions used to estimate the emissions, and a narrative describing the assumptions about the future of society. Initial condition uncertainty is most important when the goal of the simulation is to represent actual âclimate forecastsâ rather than representative âclimate projections.â Projections are often conditional: Given a set of emissions, the expected result is a speciï¬c climate. But a forecast is more speciï¬c. What will happen to the climate in 2020, or 2055 (the latter is more of a projection). The deterministic weather forecast problem is a classic example of a problem that relies strongly on accurate and complete initial conditions. In climate applications, the early decades of a simulation depend strongly of the initialization of the ocean. It is possible for the same model to determine quite different climates from different initializations, which is a motivation for ensemble results. Even if the initializations were (impossibly) perfect, model errors would lead to imperfect forecasts. There are methods for mathematical quantiï¬cation of uncertainty. These methods for uncertainty quantiï¬cation involve understanding how perturbations to the different sources of uncertainty change the results. The computational demands of climate models as well as the complexity make brute-force methods of uncertainty quantiï¬cation impractical. The uncertainty in a few parameters can be assessed explicitly, by varying different parameters over a range. This is hard to do with"
364,228,0.301,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Food systems and food security are greatly affected by environmental changes such as land degradation, loss of biodiversity, and alteration in hydrology or climate patterns. These changes may be either natural or anthropogenic in origin, although it is the alterations of anthropogenic origin that contribute most to environmental change. Food systems include activities such as food production, processing, packaging, and distribution and retailing. They are complex systems influenced by environmental, social, and economic factors, and they link directly with policy and public health issues. Currently, the accepted definition of food security as defined by the International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) is âaccess by all people at all times to the food needed for a healthy life,â [FAO/WHO 1992a, as cited by the Committee on World Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization (Food and Agriculture Organization-Food and Nutrition Division and Publishing Management 1997)]. Food insecurity, on the other hand, is defined as lack of access to enough food for a healthy and active life. According to a definition that had its origins in the 1970s, however, food security refers to the availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability of food supplies (Stamoulis and Zezza 2003, as cited in Springer Editorial 2009). Food availability is often associated with climatic changes that can affect the agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry sectors. Accessibility, however, depends on the knowledge and resources of households themselves. Such knowledge and resources include strategies utilized by households for food acquisition, that is, their ability to produce food and exchange assets for food. The strategies may include borrowing money, selling assets, or engaging in wage labor to provide food for the family. While neither rural nor urban households are spared from food insecurity, especially during seasonal troughs, the former are able to produce their own food, while the latter purchase most of their foods. The urban households are therefore more affected by food insecurity, especially if jobs are lost, incomes fall, and food prices increase. In terms of utilization, women are usually responsible for food procurement, preparation, and storage, especially in rural areas. Stability of food supply, meanwhile, is defined by use of a set of strategies to cope with both major and minor stresses. Communities that live in stressful environments, in particular, have developed strategies to reduce the impact of environmental stresses on household food security in the short- and/or long term. An important strategy is protection of the resource base through production practices that do not damage the environment to the detriment of the agriculture, fishery, and forestry sectors. An example would be changing cropping systems to increase farm productivity. Another coping strategy is to ensure that the procurement of food does not lead to the loss of a householdâs capacity to produce using its assets such as land, equipment, and farm animals. The issue of risks to food security from environmental degradation is of major importance, because the poor are the ones most affected. In rural areas where a high incidence of poverty exists, the rural poor are forced to cultivate fragile and marginal lands causing soil erosion. This renders them very vulnerable to environmental"
271,163,0.301,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Eight main aims were identified concerning the question why people participate in Repair CafÃ©s and why they repair media technologies and why they organize the repair events: conservation of resources, waste prevention, appreciation for the device, the fun of repairing, meeting and talking to people, sharing knowledge, learning repair skills and economic considerations. People involved in Repair CafÃ©s are aware of the harmful production processes of media technologies: âI think especially the repairing of computers is important as they contain resources, because of which people in other countries die. And we should not throw these [technologies] away and buy a new iPhone,â says Simon Meyer,10 a Repair CafÃ© organizer.11 One participant even calls the people producing media technologies âslavesâ. Many organizers and participants point to the harmful pollution and situations of war under which the resources needed for digital media technologies (such as coltan) are extracted. They try to conserve resources by not buying new technologies but prolonging the lifespan of existing ones. A second dominant aim for people who are repairing their devices is waste prevention: âWe would have a better world if more people repaired their things [â¦] because our planet would be less polluted,â says 60-year-old Maria Frey, repairing her broken mobile phone. Participants point to waste dumps, in Ghana for example, where people burn broken media technologies to extract reusable resources while damaging their health and the environment in the process, including through the pollution caused by toxic substances that end up in soil and groundwater.12 Therefore, participants try to avoid the production of new media technologies and disposal of existing ones by prolonging the lifespan of their possessions. They stress the value of their existing devices and their personal relationship with the technologies they possess: âIâm befriended with my smartphone,â says Peter Stephen, who is trying to repair his mobile phone. The 58-year-old participant Manuel Maier underlines the amount of work which goes into each device. The people inventing, developing and designing the products, and those constructing them, are a reason for him to value his goods and try to maintain them. Another aim for people offering help in the repair process (who were in the case studies chosen only men) is that they enjoy repairing things: Paul Winter, a 55-year-old organizer, describes the volunteers as technophiles. But the pleasure of participants who successfully repair their devices is a reason to arrange these events: âWhen the repair was"

It collapses merely when we admit that causes may be only necessary but not sufficient for at least some events that matter to us in terms of our decision-making some of the time. Moreover, across a wide range of contemporary fields, including mathematics, computer science and physics, as well as economics, it appears increasingly clear that there are also events that just do not really have any cause at all [7, 8]. This ties in very closely with Keynesâ ontological notion of uncertainty."

In other words, growth is possible but leads to a diminishing marginal utility of labour. When this limit is reached, we find the âtypicalâ picture of agrarian societies, in which the majority of the population, including children, incessantly performs demanding physical work while still suffering from shortages of essential resources. This logic, which Ester Boserup has studied on a worldwide basis and of which she provides a detailed description, represents a fundamental limitation of societal development in agrarian regimes: as a rule, growth in this regime eventually leads, despite progress made regarding methods of husbandry and plant cultivation, to the stagnating or even diminishing availability of per capita material and energy resources. Furthermore, the absence of the possibility to transform heat energy into mechanical work limits the degrees of freedom. Mechanical work can only be performed through the physical work of humans, animals and water/wind energy; thus, the productivity that was thereby attainable remained relatively low.5 Altogether, the size and structure of societal metabolism and its spatial differentiation were subject to limitation through the controlled solar energy system. In Europe, before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, 2â4 t of raw material and 30â70 gigajoules (GJ)6 of primary energy were appropriated per capita and year, whereby biomass accounted for over 80 % of all material and 95 % of all energy inputs: food for human populations, livestock feed and wood for construction and fuel. Regional differences in metabolism were related in particular to the varying relevance of holding livestock and climatic conditions.7 Starting in seventeenth century England, increased use of coal led to the development of a new energy system. At the core of this energy transition was a transition from the use of energy flows with low power density in the form of biomass that is regrown annually to the exploitation of large-scale energy deposits that had accumulated over geological eras and existed in a concentrated form as coal, with a high power density (Smil 2003). Initially, coal was used solely as an often quite unpopular fuel for stoves in the households of manufacturing workers in urban centres, whose increasing requirements could not be supplied by fuelwood alone. Fortunately, coal supplies in England were found close to these centres, and coal could also be transported at low cost via waterways.8"

112,109,0.301,Designing Sustainable Energy For All : Sustainable Product-Service System Design Applied To Distributed Renewable Energy,"It is important to underline that not all shifts to PSS result in environmental beneï¬ts: a PSS must be speciï¬cally designed, developed and delivered, if it is to be highly eco-efï¬cient. For example, schemes where products are borrowed and returned incur transportation costs (and the resultant use of fuel as well as polluting emissions) over the life of the product. In some speciï¬c instances, the total fuel cost and environmental impact may make the system non-viable in the long term. Furthermore, even when well designed, it has been observed that some PSS changes could generate unwanted side effects, usually referred to as rebound effects. Society is a set of complexes, interrelated systems that are not clearly understood. As a result, something may happen that turns potential environmentally sound solutions into an increase in global consumption of environmental resources at the practical level. One example is the impact of PSS on consumer behaviour. For example, outsourcing, rather than ownership of products, could lead to careless (less ecological) behaviours. Nevertheless, S.PSS development seen presents great potential for generating win-win solutions that promote proï¬t and environmental beneï¬ts. It has the potential to provide the necessary, if not sufï¬cient, conditions to enable communities to leapfrog to less resource-intensive (more dematerialised) systems of social and economic systems."
376,715,0.301,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","enrichment, altered disturbance regimes, and urbanization (Steffen et al. 2004). These abiotic changes will almost certainly lead to subsequent changes in species composition and biogeochemical cycling that can irreversibly alter the system from its historic condition (Seastedt et al. 2008). In addition to abiotic changes, biotic modifications may also contribute to the development of novel ecosystems. These biotic changes may include new species invasions (plants or animals, including livestock), local extinction of keystone species or ecosystem engineers. While some ecosystems remain intact, many, if not most, are novel and have an altered structure and function with unprecedented combinations of species under new abiotic conditions, compared to historic systems. This is an important starting point for the development and prioritization of invasive species management programs (Seastedt et al. 2008; Perring et al. 2013). However, it is likely that these novel systems are capable of further transformation and may not necessarily represent a resilient community. This is an important consideration in identifying desired outcomes and long-term management strategies that are designed to maximize ecosystem function and services, yet build and maintain ecological resilience (Eviner et al. 2012). Innovation, adaptation, and social flexibility will be required to attain these goals (Seastedt et al. 2008). Many restoration efforts have the objective of recreating the historic landscape, despite the uncertainty associated with what is actually the ânaturalâ ecosystem (Hobbs et al. 2009; Jackson and Hobbs 2009). In most cases outside of Europe and Asia, for example, the historic or ânaturalâ ecosystem is defined as what was present before Europeans exerted their widespread influence on landscapes (Black et al. 2006; Bowman 1998). The goal of restoring ecosystems back to their ânaturalâ state can only be effective when the historic range of variability in abiotic and biotic feedback mechanisms are still present (Seastedt et al. 2008). This may be feasible in some systems, for example, high elevation meadows, forests and riparian areas or remote and isolated wildlands, where invasive species have had only a limited impact. Alternatively, if the definition of a historic system is broadened to include a certain amount of modification and addition of new species, it may not be possible to conserve or restore the site to near-historic conditions, yet it may represent a functionally similar system (Hobbs et al. 2009). With an even broader definition of a historic system, it is possible to restore the key features and functions of the ecosystem, without the constraint of eliminating all nonindigenous species. Land managers need to take these considerations into account when assessing the feasibility of success, economic realities, and even intrinsic cultural values. While restoration to a historic or near-historic ecosystem is possible in some cases, the abiotic and biotic feedbacks may have been so dramatically altered for many rangelands that they now represent novel ecosystems with unique assemblages of species and functions that have no analog to historic systems (Hobbs et al. 2009). Novel ecosystem recovery to conditions resembling historic conditions through restoration is considered very unlikely or impossible (Jackson and Hobbs 2009; Seastedt et al. 2008). Consequently, restoration programs should focus on managing for future change that emphasizes ecosystem function, goods, and services (Hobbs et al. 2011), maintaining genetic and species diversity, and"

Developmental evaluation has applicability where there is uncertainty, and where the program might need to change and adapt according to emerging and changing contexts. This is particularly applicable in the case of climate change adaptation, and in the case of the CC-CBA project, significant path changes were required in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in December 2013. A key characteristic of developmental evaluation is that it supports continuous learning and innovation through embedding evaluators as part of the team engaged in project delivery, in a long-term partnering relationship.25 The CC-CBA design integrated the research component within the project and indeed it was the role of researchers to facilitate evidence-based, systematic reflection on project progress. Strong individual and organisational partnerships were successfully built.26 The practical realities of program budgets meant that evaluative researchers could not be embedded full-time within the project implemented, but were directly involved in research design and inception and through the course of the evaluative process interacted with project implementers periodically throughout the 3-year project."
38,23,0.3,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"sampling and species identiï¬cation is more cost-effective and situation-appropriate if conducted using local and regional expertise. A more positive view is that networks are the appropriate structure for addressing certain categories of problems, which happen to be pervasive in the modern era. These include complex and interconnected issues (like biodiversity loss) in which there are many affected parties, none of whom can solve the issue by working alone (Kickert et al. 1997). Networks are intrinsically adaptive, arguably more so than top-down structures, despite the apparent power and responsiveness of traditional command-and-control approaches. This paradox is explained by the fact that centrally-directed action is only effective if the goal is clearly deï¬ned, relatively unchanging and shared by all parties. Polymorphous, emerging and shifting objectives are better served by a more devolved approach. Anyone who has been part of a large, hierarchical organisation will know they have inherent inertia. Notable examples of biodiversity networks are the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Species 2000 (Roskov et al. 2013), and World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS; Boxshall et al. 2014; Costello et al. 2014). GBIF is a network of countries and afï¬liated NGOs. Species 2000âs members publish species databases through its website, and WoRMS is a network of over 200 individual taxonomists who edit parts of a common online database. Other forms of partnerships also exist, such as consortium agreements (e.g., FishBase) (reviewed by Costello et al. 2014), but the most enduring initiatives are international. GEO BON is a ânetwork of networksâ. Its parent body (GEO) was formed to catalyse a âcoordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth Observationâ system in support of informed decision-making worldwideâ. Like its parent body, GEO BON is a voluntary âcommunity of practiceâ that serves to translate user needs in the broad arena of biodiversity (but especially at national to global scales, where the needs are often related to international treaties), into observational products and services, through collaboration between the many existing biodiversity information sources and other Earth observation systems. Biodiversity observation, while intrinsically a collaborative activity, has not always been achieved through networks. Even in the present time, much of the primary work is done within centrally-managed organisations. As the scope of the activity increases and as larger scale drivers of biodiversity change increase in prominence, those organisations are increasingly dependent on the activities of other organisations to effectively detect and attribute biodiversity change. It is possible to imagine a global unitary organisation focussed on biodiversity observations, but it would almost certainly be unachievable in the foreseeable future given issues of national sovereignty and the sheer scale of the task. To address the urgent current needs for increased and shared biodiversity observations, some form of collaborative network seems inevitable. While networks are often presented as a âlow-costâ option involving little more than existing efforts, they come with additional transactional costs which can be large enough to overwhelm the beneï¬ts flowing from collaboration (Costello et al. 2014). Apparently-simple guidelines can avoid this outcome: donât work through a"
233,63,0.3,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"expressed enthusiasm for the option value idea (Maclaurin and Sterelny 2008, section 8.4) we now think that the answer lies elsewhere. The crucial problem with option value is that it ties the value of biodiversity to judgements about value made by ordinary people (consumers in the economistâs terms). Clearly actual assessments of such option value will be difï¬cult (Norton 1988). Even if we could assess such judgements, human beings are not good at reasoning about risk and they have limited biological knowledge. So it might be that peopleâs actual assessments about the option value in natural systems would be very poor guides to the likely effects of conservation on future human communities or on future ecosystems. If we hedge our bets to maximise future outcomes then we should do so based on our best information about the probability of such outcomes rather than on the estimates that consumers might make about such outcomes. In light of these issues, the value of biodiversity is better analysed as an instance of consequentialism, broadly applied. We should conserve biodiversity, not because people want to, but because doing so will on average lead to better outcomes for people and human communities of perhaps more broadly for moral patients (organisms capable of experiencing suffering).5 However, even the consequentialist interpretation faces an important objection developed at length in chapter 6 of Maier (2012). It might be objected that our uncertainty about future states of the biosphere and future goals and preferences of people implies that conservation based on a general measure of biodiversity is as likely to produce net harm as it is net beneï¬t (after all, the species we are conserving include many whose effects on human populations are currently unknown). There are of course instances in which diversity works against us, as when we are threatened by a diversity of pathogens. That said, ours is an extremely successful species with an extremely broad niche. We have become adept at harnessing a great variety of features of the natural world to an astounding variety of ends. The number of species that pose a serious threat to humanity is a vanishingly small proportion of the total species count. Moreover, a great number of weeds and pests are not harmful in their native habitat, but only become harmful when that habitat is radically disturbed or when they are introduced by humans into other ecosystems (Baker 1974). We therefore think it implausible that conserving unremarkable species will on average produce more harm than beneï¬t. Put another wayâwere possible, at the press of a button, to destroy all those species and biological communities not known to be of special value to humanity, we think it would be irrational to do so. Humanity (and perhaps other sufï¬ciently sentient species) would almost certainly be worse off. So where we cannot assess the likely payoff for conserving an individual unremarkable species, it is nonetheless rational to assume that that payoff will be positive. This does not of course tell us anything about how large such a payoff will be and we acknowledge that there is an interesting and difï¬cult question about weighing the beneï¬ts of such conservation against the opportunity cost of forgoing alter5"
73,356,0.3,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Abstract In most peri-urban communities of south east Nigeria, shortages of domestic water supply relative to demand is a common feature. This is because most of these peri-urban communities usually fall outside the urban water supply projects physical boundary, thus forcing the people who live there to consume water from doubtful sources which most often contain pathogens found in human faeces. Apart from consuming water from doubtful sources, most inhabitants of this area also travel long distances to collect it or pay dearly to purchase it from water vendors. The study was therefore undertaken to determine the factors necessary for a safe water supply in such areas. Towards achieving this objective, a questionnaire was designed and 2000 were administered to households in the area between January and June, 2013. A total of 15 factors were isolated and analysed in 10 periurban communities of the region. The major analytical tool employed was multiple regression analysis with which we were able to determine the relative importance of each variable using SPSS version 20. Based on the result obtained, important determining factors for safe and sustainable water services were discussed in terms of their implications to the formulation of a needed policy that will ensure improvement in supply of the service to meet demand.

320,298,0.3,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"This framework helps to identify the response options available to managers of protected areas on a local or regional level but also emphasises the need for cooperation with stakeholders and scientists. It is applicable in all protected areas across Europe and other continents. However, this approach needs an adequate budget, as well as time and expertise. Without additional financial means that have to be provided to protected areas the adaptation of conservation management will be not feasible. Recommendations for required adaptations at policy level targeted at planning and implementation by regional, national, and international institutions â in parallel to adaptation in protected areas â are described in Chap. 9. The methodical approach presented in this chapter aims to answer the key questions for managers in protected areas when it comes to adaptation: â How can management of protected areas be adapted to climate change? â What problems and difficulties may be experienced in adapting protected area management and how can they be solved? â How can protected area managers reduce uncertainties by managing natural resources and learning about them at the same time?"
73,268,0.3,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Cities which protect their hinterlands are likely to be the most economically prosperous this century. The maintenance of physical attractiveness and natural resources will prove to be essential to continued economic innovation, and will make signiï¬cant contributions to wealth, health, personal identity and social harmony in both city and region. The retention of peri-urban agricultural areas will also contribute to the development of more resilient urban food systems. The level of successful interaction of these factors will deï¬ne a liveable and functioning community. Yet governments routinely separate economic, social and environment sectors and fail to use tools within the land use planning system to achieve integration. Governments also separate rural areas from towns, and urban hinterlands from metropolitan areas. Such spatial separation leads to sectoral policies which are as fragmented as the pattern of land ownership. Climate change, environmental degradation, regional population increases and a range of global, national and regional factors are expected to increase pressures on regional resources. Climate change is likely to reduce the resilience of human and natural systems leading to tolerance thresholds being exceeded and vulnerability increased. It is likely to particularly impact the natural systems that underpin food production. The result could be a greatly increased risk of non-linear change over a short period that is both catastrophic and irreversible. However, institutional and policy fragmentation is hampering the ability of governments at all levels to develop anticipatory policies which can assist the peri-urban region to adapt to rapid and fundamental change. In times of rapid change with unpredictable outcomes, the resources of periurban areas may increase in importance. It would seem prudent to maintain the values of peri-urban areas, at least in the short term, during times of increasing change and threat. Integrated regional planning is essential if reciprocal impacts of sectors are to be considered and such planning requires a strong role for governments. A range of subdivision practices based around commercial or residential uses is increasingly being employed in Australian peri-urban areas. However, a return to regulatory practice will need to consider readoption of planning techniques formerly used, included tenement controls, rural lot restructuring and strong subdivision and use controls."
269,205,0.3,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"This book disturbs the tendency, in writings about interdisciplinarity, to cleave to the terrain of ideas, disagreements, and knowledge claims â and, in so doing, to disavow the complex ripples, wrinkles, and patternings of affect that course through what is all-too-often assumed to be an unruffled plane of interdisciplinary interaction. We pay attention, here, to how those wrinkles get rubbed out, how they are sometimes smoothed over, and how, sometimes, they endure within and between the unsuspecting bodies of interdisciplinary researchers themselves. We have tried in this chapter to bring to visibility some of the political, methodological, ontological, and epistemological work that those emotions perform. We hope to have shown: (1) how emotion can be influential in carving out the perimeters of an interdisciplinary space (as well as determining who is inside and outside of it); (2) how researchers can engage in various tactics to ensure that collaboration does not entirely fall apart; (3) how political and ontological differences can be experienced affectively (and vice versa); (4) how the eruption of unexpected â and superficially unimportant â moments of affect can be diagnostic of important lines of conjunction and contestation within interdisciplinary spaces; and (5) how acknowledgement of affective bewilderment while in interdisciplinary spaces is easily misconstrued as either a deliberate or unwitting removal from the terrain of the political. We worry that our inclusion of instances of mostly negatively valenced emotion has been done, at least in part, through some desire to seek sympathy, to settle scores, or to parade, in the interests of exhibitionism, shameful episodes of our own making. But we also want to insist that to decide not to attend to the movements and textures of, and manifold responses (whether regulatory or dysregulatory) to such emotion in interdisciplinary spaces, is to miss much of what is happening in them.

183,39,0.3,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"In humanitarian emergencies, information communication technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones and web-based platforms offer powerful tools for communicating with communities, remote needs assessments and data collection. A quickly growing literature confirms the benefits that ICTs can offer to aid efforts with regards to efficiency, effectiveness and accountability (Raftree and Bamberger 2014; Kalas and Spurk 2011). These promises are especially pronounced in insecure environments, where access constraints hinder aid actors from reaching local populations, such that digital channels could be the only way to send and receive critical information. At the same time, the potential consequences of implementing technology-based projects poorly or overseeing unintended consequences can be detrimental and sometimes lethal. Recognizing the challenges and risks with technologies can help avoid pitfalls and unintended digital harm. ICTs are known to introduce complications in a number of ways: Digital tools themselves alter the interaction between aid staff and recipients, which can add to and exacerbate crises or conflict dynamics (Jacobsen 2015; Vazquez and Wall 2014; Altay and Labonte 2014). The digitization of communications introduces new security and privacy risks as data transmitted on electronic devices or networks becomes susceptible to third party interception and breaches, sometimes unnoticeably (Internews 2015; Schneier 2015). However, such challenges entangled with using ICT for humanitarian purposes have not been adequately researched or addressed in literature and practice.

224,230,0.3,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Within our theoretical framework, human time is characterised by the following metabolic characteristics. First, and analogously to the other relevant biophysical resources (materials, energy and land), human time is a limited resource. Each individual has 24 h per day at his/her disposal. All human time has to be used in some manner, and preference for one activity over another is contingent on culturally prescribed means of self-maintenance and reproduction. In addition, each human lifetime hour, whether âproductiveâ or not, requires a certain metabolic input (i.e. matter and energy). Otherwise, social conflict arises, and people starve and die. The time at oneâs disposal, whether oneâs own time or that of other individuals, is one critical indicator of freedom and power. How human time is used, therefore, is a crucial variable that determines and is determined by the systemâs social metabolism and its regime transitions. In some instances, societies have resisted transitions from hunting and gathering to agriculture because they were not prepared to invest the greater amount of labour time required; in contrast, the willingness of other societies to do so paved the way for agricultural transitions (Carlstein 1982; Ellen 1982)."
35,412,0.3,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"therefore deï¬nitely proved the suitability of these bivalve extractive species for open ocean aquaculture. Another approach for multi-use in offshore wind farms is its use as marine protected area or even for reinforcement or restoration of endangered species, which need the absence of any ï¬sheries activity for recovery. Current projects are testing this perspective for the native European oyster Ostrea edulis and the European lobster Homarus gammarus. From the technological point of view there are many options on how to connect aquaculture devices, such as longline and ring structures as well as different cage types, to the foundations as well as to install it in the centre of the free area between wind turbines. Next to the system design also experiments on drag forces originating from the aquaculture structure on the foundation and vice versa were investigated. Complementary to the biological, environmental end technical aspects, a number of studies were speciï¬cally targeted to address and include stakeholders, their attitudes, their interests and concerns over time. By this approach, the inclusion of stakeholders into the research process from its very beginning until today, co-production of knowledge could be fostered. Next to joint identiï¬cation of the major impediments and concerns of offshore aquaculture under multi-use conditions, new issues and research questions were identiï¬ed. Primary focus on the economic potential of aquaculture in offshore wind farms was shown for consumption mussels. The production of mussels using longline technology is sufï¬ciently proï¬table even under the assumption of substantial cost increases. This is especially true, if existing capacities could be used. Last but not least, the EEZ is a special areaâit is not a state territory even if a coastal state has its sovereign rights and jurisdiction. It is an area where three legal systems come together: international law, law of the European Union and national law. There are no mariculture projects in the German EEZ and no approval procedure has been completed so far. Some sites are not suitable for mariculture, especially because of nature conservation and shipping."

175,1046,0.3,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Social performance criteria are often not easily deï¬ned as direct functions of hydrological attributes. Most social objectives are only indirectly related to hydrological attributes or other measures of water resource system performance. Economic, environmental, and ecological impacts resulting from water management policies directly affect people. One social performance criterion that has been considered in some water resources development projects, especially in developing regions, has been employment. Where employment is considered important, alternatives that provide more jobs may be preferred to those that use more heavy machinery in place of labor, for example. Another social performance criterion is human settlement displacement. The number of families that must move from their homes because of, for example, flood plain restoration or reservoir construction, is always of concern. These impacts can be expressed as a function of the extent of flood plain restoration or reservoir storage capacity, respectively. Often the people most affected are in the lower-income groups, and this raises legitimate issues of social justice and equity. Human resettlement impacts have both social and economic dimensions. Social objectives are often the more fundamental objectives discussed earlier in this chapter. Asking âwhyâ identiï¬es them. Why improve"

Environmental issues are not particularly prominent during this period, the harmfulness of environmental problems also lack enough understanding. In understanding the relationship between environment and economy, it is widely believed that environmental pollution is the price to pay for economic development, thus making the policy choice is to pursue rapid economic growth, consume large amounts of resources, at the expense of environment, damage ecology, which is simply âeconomic development determinism.â Especially for developing countries, economic growth becomes a priority target."
277,443,0.3,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"long-standing preference for integration dialogues to take place in governmentsponsored commissions. Since the 1980s, such commissions have tended to be launched after significant focusing events, usually an outbreak of disorder or violence, be it race riots, racist murders, or acts of terrorism. We developed this insight by suggesting that independent commissions are an ideal venue to study science-society dialogues, since they involve a wider set of actors than is normally included in policymaking, usually a combination of academics, practitioners, and representatives of civil society (see also Chap. 5 for a comparison between similar commissions in Germany and the Netherlands). Furthermore, evidence-gathering about complex social problems is a primary activity of commissions, and commissions therefore often draw upon social science data and deploy social research methods. Accordingly, we compared three commissions which reported in the 2000s: the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain in 2000 (CMEB); the Community Cohesion Review Team (CCRT) in 2001; and the Commission on Integration and Cohesion in 2007 (CIC). The findings of the CCRT â most subject to government influence of the three â were used for both instrumental and substantiating purposes. The choice of the trusted Cantle as chair, the narrow terms of reference, and the stress on âmaking things happenâ, all indicate it was geared towardss substantiating the new policy paradigm of community cohesion. However, the commissioners drew up a number of detailed policy proposals, which exceeded policymakersâ expectations, and these proposals subsequently contributed to policymaking in an instrumental fashion. The CIC, by contrast, is judged to fit most closely to what we term the âlegitimisingâ function of knowledge use. Its drawn-out launch and proceedings, its broad remit, and the lack of interest paid to its findings, meant that the commissionâs output was not used to rationally adjust policy instruments. Instead, the manner in which findings were disseminated via the media indicates that policymakers were anxious to signal to the public that action was being taken to address what was perceived to be an urgent problem, highlighted by the London bombings. Interestingly, we also found that the amount and duration of media coverage is more important than whether such coverage is favourable or not. This is demonstrated by the history of the CMEB, which was launched not by government but by the Runnymede Trust think-tank (although with close backing from senior government politicians). The CMEBâs composition and workings indicate a partly instrumental and partly legitimising role. On the one hand, its sponsors and supporters intended and expected that it would influence policy. Yet Runnymedeâs trustees and the commissionâs Labour backers also appear to be motivated by a desire to signal the commissionâs authority and significance. Interestingly, the initial media reaction to the CMEB report was extremely unfavourable. Yet the longrunning controversy that the CMEB report generated in the media meant that its various proposals were debated at length. Thus, the CMEB remained in the public spotlight, and therefore on the policymaking agenda. In time, many of its findings and recommendations were in fact implemented, corresponding to what Carole Weiss terms the âenlightenmentâ function of knowledge."

The scarcity of resources has become a common problem confronted by the entire world and the contention for resources usually triggers the conflict and turbulence among countries and results in the instability of world political and economic development. Furthermore, the environmental problems are also beyond social system and beyond ideology: the environmental problems of pollution, climate change, etc. exist in a country of any system.

365,1022,0.299,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"take advantage of opportunities to diversify. The case studies presented, as well as more general literature on adaptation, indicate that water management is a key issue for climate change adaptation and increasing resilience in agriculture. It can be a successful â and essential â adaptation strategy but it requires substantial public investments, which can be problematic when resources are scarce. Managing irrigation schemes after the initial investment can also lead to smaller gains than originally anticipated. We asked our panel to respond to three questions related to these findings: (i) How important do you think it is for policy-makers to promote SLWM practices and what role does policy play in promoting it? Cao Duc Phat considers SLWM important to address climate change and improve the sustainability of natural resource use. This is particularly important in densely populated rural areas as in Vietnam, where land pressures are rising due to urbanization and industrialization, further exacerbated by sea level rise. SLWM allows for sustainable intensification of production systems, and thus is essential to ensure livelihoods and stable living conditions for rural residents. Public-private-partnerships (PPP) are an important means of promoting adoption of such techniques. The public sector can invest in infrastructure and enhance private sector investments with improved access to credit and insurance. It also has an important role to play in developing flexible land use policies that are needed to enable widespread adoption. Sanchez sees the development of an enabling value chain as essential for promoting SLWM across the entire value chain, from services to production, to value added, transport, market, consumption and consideration of environmental effects. He states: I think what is really needed is to bundle many of these services in a way that provides good tools to farmers so they donât have to worry about things like credit or where to sell their crops."

224,31,0.299,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"1.2 Agricultural Change Boserup erupted on the international, trans-disciplinary scene in 1965 with the publication of her landmark book, The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure (Boserup 1965). This brief, nontechnical work offered a powerful set of ideas in opposition to neo-Malthusian and other prevailing ideas of the time about agricultural development. Turned down by several publishers, her book was discovered and enthusiastically embraced by other social sciences, foremost those parts of anthropology and geography dealing with (quasi) subsistence, smallholder farming systems. The Conditions of Agricultural Growth has been published by five different publishing houses in 17 issues from 1965 to 2008, and translated into French, Swedish, Japanese and Estonian. The large and sustained impact of this work has at least a three-fold explanation. First, it addressed an enduring theme the relationship between population and environmental resources, which has regularly resurfaced in different expressions, at least since the work of Thomas Malthus in 1798. Boserup challenged his proposition that the relatively slow-growth in the âfood ceilingâ served as the upper limit for the more fast-paced, potential growth in population. She reversed the causality, arguing that increases in population (or land) pressure trigger the development or use of technologies and management strategies to increase production commensurate with demand. Agricultural intensity thus rises with population density (or land pressures in related literatures), absent constraints on the process.2 Over the long run, this process transforms the physical and social (e.g., land tenure, labour markets, and other societal structures) landscapes, the historical dimensions of which Boserup elaborated in Population and Technological Change: A Study of Long-Term Trends (Boserup 1981). The endogeneity of the techno-managerial strategies of agriculture was foundational to her thesis and influenced the induced innovation thesis explaining the contemporary pathways of investment in and use of agricultural technology at large (Hayami and Ruttan 1985). Despite this, Boserupâs thesis that was not well developed regarding qualitative shifts in technology (e.g., to fossil fuels) that fundamentally change land-labour and thus structural relationships in society (Krausmann et al. 2008). She did trace the broad strokes of industrial technology on agriculture in sparsely populated and underdeveloped lands (Boserup 1981), and"

When Redfield refers to the institute as a âtotalitarian systemâ, an âoppressive regimeâ, this is not completely besides the truth of course as we have seen, but it also seems self-referential.

284,331,0.299,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Communal approaches to environmental justice Communities across the Americas are involved in designing and implementing local solutions that contribute to their broad struggle for environmental justice under circumstances of harassment and overt violence exercised by state powers in the societies of which they are a part. While a great deal of energy must be devoted to protecting themselves from encroachment by forces attempting to control their natural resources and subject them to the various disciplines of markets and political systems, it is remarkable that they continue to mobilize locally and nationally while associating internationally with other communities and NGOs to consolidate new lines and technologies of production, and experiment with ways to improve existing activities. These actions are the product of the complex interaction of dynamic forces within the communities and reactions to outside pressures. They are part of a search for a unique identity that has become increasingly important as these peoples assert their legally binding rights to self-determination as deï¬ned by their varied histories and their understanding of the privileges accorded them by the ILO Convention 169 and similar agreements promulgated by other international bodies, and the ongoing efforts in the Organization of American States (2003) to draft a similar commitment (endnote ix). In Mexico, as elsewhere, this process has a long history, which was codiï¬ed in its constitution of 1917, as indigenous communities were recognized and granted collective rights by the agrarian reform.14 During the last half of the twentieth century, Mexican communities waged an unrelenting and difï¬cult battle to assert their rights to control the lands over which they were able to retain or regain control after the revolution. They were particularly effective in wresting exploitation contracts for their communal forests from private ï¬rms that had been given concessions to manage them (Bray and Merino-PÃ©rez, 2004). Today there are a variety of management plans in effect, testimony to skills that the communities have acquired as they attempt to reconcile pressures for ensuring conservation with the need to create jobs and generate incomes. The literature offers rich accounts of this variety of strategies, and many studies explore the relationship between these approaches and the cosmologies of the participating communities, particularly in community-managed forests, which comprise 71% of the nationâs forests (e.g. Bray, Merino-PÃ©rez and Barry, 2005; Cronkleton, Bray and Medina, 2011; Barkin and Fuente, 2013; Stevens et al., 2014).15 The movement to reassert indigenous identities in Mexico was further strengthened in the aftermath of the 1994 uprising in Chiapas"

309,234,0.299,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"Organic in Global Contexts: A Brief Overview Organic food production in the broadest sense entails a mode of farming based on the principles of health, ecology, fairness and care (IFOAM 2005). As an integrated farming approach, it aims to maintain the vitality of plants, soils, animals and human health and make use of on-farm and local resources (Vogl et al. 2005, 6; Scott et al. 2009, 63). Explicit organic farming ideas emerged in the early twentieth century in the Global North as a critique of the effects of petrochemical agricultural inputs on the environment as well as human health (Scott et al. 2009, 63). Throughout the twentieth century, organic farmers in many countries began to organise themselves through associations, within which organic standards were agreed upon democratically (Vogl et al. 2005, 9). The certification of organic products then was a response to growing citizen interest in organic food in the 1960s and 1970s (Scott et al. 2009, 63). The early emergence of organic markets and consumer interest in organic food in the Global North were often related to broader environmental movements concerned with eco-central societal transformations towards sustainability and systemic change (Barendregt and Jaffe 2014, 5). For instance, the USA of the 1960s witnessed an organic food movement striving for small-scale food production, ecological responsibility and community engagement (Johnston et al. 2009, 510). In Western Europe, organic consumption gained considerable momentum as part of a wider environmental movement against the ecological impacts of industrialised food systems in the 1970s, itself originating in anti-establishment student uprisings (Poulain 2017, 66). While eating organic in these contexts was often embedded in environmental activism and attempts to establish an alternative to the conventional food system, large parts of the organic sector in North America and Europe have transformed into what Johnston et al. (2009) have termed the âcorporate-organic foodscapeâ. The term refers to the institutionalisation and corporatisation of organic agriculture, resulting in often large-scale industrial organic farms and their integration into global commodity chains (Raynolds 2004). This integration of organic farming into corporate and globe-spanning food systems and commercial consumption since the 1990s (Johnston et al. 2009) was in"
282,20,0.299,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"2.1.2.2 Networks Networks are the subject of an impressive body of literature in anthropology, sociology, political science and economics. Naturally, these studies contain a broad variety of approaches, themes and focal points. When trying to establish how networks relate to partnerships, it is useful to distinguish three modes of network research: network analysis, network theories or models and networks as empirical phenomena. As an analytical approach, network analysis had an early precursor in the sociological work of Georg Simmel16 around the turn of the last century. It developed into a more widespread and coherent approach in sociology and anthropology17 in the 1970s and has further developed since. In essence, network analysis is an approach to social enquiry that focuses on the interactions between individuals or organisations. To understand certain dynamics or outcomes, it typically maps the links and exchanges between different actors, often using complex mathematical and statistical tools. Based on patterns of interaction or the position of different actors in the network, situations can be classified.18 In political science, policy network analysis is closely associated with the notion of âgovernanceâ.19 Governance theories and approaches often take the diminished capability of central government to govern using traditional methods as their point of departure20 and focus on ways of steering by political authorities.21 Over recent years, a vast body of literature discussing the concept of governance and applying network approaches to policy analysis has developed. Yet the cumulative insights derived from the governance debate seem limited and network analysis as an analytical approach has serious shortcomings.22 Moreover, a network approach is ill suited for achieving the purposes of the present enquiry, namely, to develop accountability standards for partnerships. Therefore, this study does not adopt a network approach to social analysis. Network theory, by contrast, is mainly concerned with explaining why networks emerge, how they operate and what impact they have on social interactions. An important source of network theory is transaction cost analysis. It posits that firms choose that organisational form which allows them to minimise their transaction costs in the production and marketing process. Thus they can either rely on the market, on hierarchies (i.e. the vertical integration of suppliers) or networks of known and trusted firms to secure needed inputs and sell their products.23 Unfortunately, ânetwork theoryâ does not constitute a coherent body of work24 generating a consistent set of assumptions and hypotheses. While some specific network theories may offer interesting insights relating to the emergence and operations of partnerships, they are unlikely to contribute much to the question of how accountable partnerships should be. Finally, the term ânetworkâ is used as an empirical category. Since the applications of network analysis and theories are extremely broad, so are the"
170,284,0.299,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"interplay between the ICT for health initiative and the existing institutional forces that shape healthcare delivery is represented in Fig. 2. The literature on ICT for development, especially the dominant discourse on ICT for health initiatives, examines the economic dimension of interventions which highlights the efficiency-related aspects of the intervention (Blaya et al. 2010). There is a need to understand the adoption and evolution of ICT4D interventions from the sociocultural perspective and to explore how the system as an institution undergoes change, if any, from the intervention. The sociocultural and the institutional aspects of ICT interventions are more relevant for the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention (Heeks and Molla 2009). In this paper, we attempt to address this gap by examining the evolution of ICT for health initiatives from the institutional logics perspective. ICT for health initiatives can be regarded as innovations that provide citizens with an alternative to their usual health-seeking avenues and that which can potentially alter the balance between conflicting logics prevalent in healthcare institutions where the interventions are attempted. The dominant rational view that ICT can act as a conduit for information transfer and hence knowledge transfer, making it possible for extending the access of medical knowledge for marginalised population and geographies, should be critically examined by investigating its effect on the basic assumptions and values that characterise the system (Arora 2010; Miscione 2007). In other words, innovations in healthcare can be understood in the backdrop of the logics that govern the healthcare system. Hence, we situate our discussion in the broad domain of logics in healthcare service institutions, specifically highlighting the trade-off between the logic of choice and logic of care (Mol 2008; van Schie and Seedhouse 1997). The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. In the next section, we dwell on the concepts of logic of choice and logic of care in healthcare. Next, based on the extant literature, we highlight the emerging themes that arise from the interplay of the two logics in the healthcare domain. In the discussion and conclusion section, we arrive at a theoretical model explicating important dilemmas and tensions occurring due to institutional dynamics when an ICT initiative is introduced in the healthcare system. The chapter concludes by outlining the agendas for future research."

Ecosystem resource has shown that outcomes may vary considerably, and, if they vary, radical shifts may occur not only due to external shocks but as a normal condition (consider summer and winter aspects of ecosystems in the North or the dry season/rainy seasons in the South).

Ultra-poverty was also highly concentratedâten countries accounted for 75 % of the worldâs total ultra-poor in 2008. In 2008 Nigeria accounted for 23 % of the worldâs ultra-poor. Understanding who the poorest are is crucial for the design of effective interventions to improve their welfare. Without context-specific and timely information, it is difficult to design programs that fit their needs. It is thus important to broaden the collection of and access to accurate data on the worldâs poorest. The evidence presented in this chapter suggests that for interventions to reach those living on less than US$0.63/day effectively, remote households that are traditionally excluded from resources and markets should be targeted, and both the low-levels of education and in the case of Asia, landlessness should be taken into account. Our findings suggest that interventions to protect the poor against health shocks, to address the exclusion of social groups, to prevent child malnutrition, and to enable investmentsâparticularly in educationâare essential for helping them rise out of poverty."

Alfred Nobel decided in his testament that the prize named after him should be awarded to the person whose research had brought the greatest beneï¬t to mankind. Under this viewpoint no one deserves this prize more than Fritz Haber, who received it immediately after the end of the First World War for the year 1918, despite international protests because of his role during the war. The Janus face of science becomes manifest in this context. Historians agree that without the Haber-Bosch process, the war would very likely have been over within less than a year, since the import of nitrates necessary for the production of explosives was blocked. This problem could be circumvented by the âsaltpeter promiseâ (âSalpeterversprechenâ) of the German chemical industry, which was building large plants for the production of ammonia to be converted into explosives. The general enthusiasm at the outbreak of the war also seized Fritz Haber, who became a volunteer like many other intellectuals. In a letter to his Swedish colleague S. Arrhenius he explained his reasons as follows: â¦ now we see it as our ethical duty, to take down our enemies with the use of all our strength and bring them to a peace that will make the return of such a war impossible for generations and give a solid foundation for the peaceful development of western Europe."

278,488,0.299,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Modern Portuguese waste management policies date from the 1990s, when urban waste was first considered to be a priority for the national environmental policies. In this context, in 1996, the first national municipal solid waste (MSW) management plan (PERSU) was approved for the period 1997â2007. Its main goals were focused on banning waste dumping in inadequate sites, which represented 73 % of the destination of the MSW generated in Portugal, and structuring a set of regional entities that would be responsible for local waste management and would have access to funding for new infrastructures. In 2006, the revision of the PERSU was launched; it resulted in a new strategy, PERSU II (2007â2016), and provided additional funding for installing a set of new infrastructures that the regional management systems considered necessary to fulfill the national waste management targets, as derived from EU directives, in terms of separating the different waste streams during waste collection, avoiding deposition in landfill and promoting the valorization of the waste collected, particularly wastes from packaging and those which are biodegradable. In parallel, industrial ecology principles emanating from academia, with major involvement of the authors at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST) â University of Lisbon, were fundamental to establish common development strategies shared by governmental, private and regional institutions, and to create mechanisms to foster the closing of material cycles through integrated management systems for end of life (EOL) products and industrial symbiosis in eco-parks. The industrial ecology academic contributions to reshape the Portuguese waste management activities were particularly relevant in the design of the systems that managed the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) of different products such as"

46,169,0.299,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"(7) The economic and political institutions on the international and global level. The local and national economy and labor market, as well as local and national public institutions, are not insular and detached from the international and global level. The global economic and political architecture and the power of transnational companies to avoid taxes, to put pressure on states and to lobby their interests highly influence child poverty and pose challenges for the supporting welfare systems. Especially in poorer countries, poverty alleviation is directly financed and designed by international institutions and NGOs; international treaties and agreements shape such countriesâ economic and social development and their ability to design and control policies in areas from health care to the labor market (Craig and Porter 2006). Hence, particularly in poor countries dominated by such international rules, child poverty is shaped to a large extent by forces external to their own political and social institutions. (8) The global community of humans. Humans share one earth, and through the various forms of globalization, the connections between them have intensified. The global chains of production and trade, which certainly produce winners and losers, mass tourism across the whole world and a globalized aid system in which resources from rich countries are transferred to poorer ones in the name of charity are just three examples of how people living in very distant places can effectively influence each otherâs lives. These connections are typically manifold and interlaced, making it difficult to isolate and specify an individualâs exact position in the overall ânetworkâ. Nevertheless, these relations exist, and their normative dimensions must also be considered in an account of responsibilities. We now have eight different groups of agents that are obviously involved in the well-being and well-becoming of a child in poverty and her being poor in the first place. Each of these groups and the agents within them, such as companies, deserve a close examination so as to scrutinize their responsibilities based on the grounds we distinguished before. Unfortunately, this would go far beyond the scope of this book, and so we present only a first systematization and ranking. After that, we will focus on two agents, the family and the state, since they are crucial to the alleviation of child poverty. (a) High level of responsibilities. The group with the highest level of responsibilities encompasses social and political institutions on the"

395,96,0.299,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"In a work environment that has few accidents, even though there are signiï¬cant hazards present, there is a likelihood that the risks are underestimated leading to a false sense of comfort or complacency. A report by Cass Business School (2011), investigated major corporate crises (explosions, ï¬res, product-related and supply chain crises, and IT3 problems) and identiï¬ed failures at board level in these organisations. There was an inability to recognise potential risks and engage with them, a tendency to ask fewer questions when things were going well and not recognising changes in the corporate environment. Recent industrial interest in applying the concept of âchronic uneaseâ to managerial and operational thinking on safety matters is an attempt to address this type of problem. The concept comes from the literature on âhigh reliability organisationsâ (HRO). A key HRO characteristic is the lack of complacency about risks. For instance, with regard to the structural failures that caused the Alexander Keilland drilling rig accident in Norway, Weick (1987, p. 119) commented Part of the mind-set for reliability requires a chronic suspicion that small deviations may enlarge, a sensitivity that may encourage a more dynamic view of reliability."

170,11,0.299,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"The age of globalisation has been defined in terms of access to modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) by some scholars (Hutton and Giddens 2001; Castells 2000; Rantanen 2001). Scholarly debate about the role of ICTs as an agent of social organisation and transformation has raged on before and since, from discussions about the networked information society (Bell 1999; Castells 1996) and consideration about the commercial potential of the technology (Gandy 2002; Shapiro and Varian 1999) to critiques of the systemic divides in organisation, access, use, adaptation and impact (Mansell 1999; Norris 2001; Warschauer 2003). Since these initial considerations, we find ourselves living in a world where ICTs have diffused widely to far-flung corners of the globe and are being deployed to confront some of the worldâs most complex problems. Scholarly debates in domains such as the global digital divide continue, in which some argue that technologies such as mobile phones have led to the expansion of socio-economic opportunity for the developing world (Donner 2008; Waverman et al. 2005), to those who claim that inequalities remain, with resultant limitations on their societal impact (Carmody 2013; Hilbert 2014). We focus here on notions of the impact of ICTs on international development, going beyond issues of access and use, well documented elsewhere. As the current Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approach the initial deadline of 2015, it is timely to take stock of the impact these technologies have had on key development problems. This moment is simultaneously the culmination of the second round of SIRCA II (the Strengthening Information Society Research Capacity Alliance), a capacity-building programme for information society research in the context of development in the Global South. It is then worthwhile too to interrogate the impact of research endeavours on the development process."

376,497,0.298,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","State and transition models (STMs) were conceived as a means to organize and communicate information about ecosystem change as a basis for management. While some authors regard âthe state and transition modelâ as a specific theory about how ecosystems respond to disturbance (see review in Pulsford et al. 2014), we take the view that STMs are not a theory per se, but are a flexible way of organizing information about ecosystem change that may draw on a wide range of concepts about ecosystem dynamics (Westoby et al. 1989). The value of STMs for rangeland managers is in fostering a general understanding of how rangelands function and respond to management actions, thereby leading to more efficient and effective allocation of management efforts. The fundamental idea is simple (see the Caldenal STM at http://jornada.nmsu. edu/esd/international/argentina). Vegetation, a commonly used indicator of ecosystem conditions, is described according to discrete plant communities (such as an open Prosopis caldenia forest with grassy understory). In doing so, we develop a logic for distinguishing different communities so that stakeholders can communicate effectively about them. Next, we describe the multiple plant communities that can occur on a particular site. The key problem in this step is to define the characteristics of the âsiteââits climate, soils, and topographic position. Otherwise we might conclude erroneously that a set of plant communities are alternative states of a specific site when in fact they exist on different sites. Finally, we identify the R.

320,167,0.298,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Management adaptation to climate change in a protected area must be based on the recognition of the status of target habitats (habitat sensitivity/resilience to stress factors), conservation objectives and the existing conflicts which arise from various anthropogenic and natural pressures. Effective management measures should be built upon recognition of pressures to increase the resilience of target habitats to the ongoing and future climate change. Informed management decisions may be taken after consulting updated maps which provide the information on the vulnerability of protected habitats to changing climatic conditions considering other existing pressures (e.g. land use, drainage). To this end, expert knowledge is needed to provide information in the form of indicators for evaluating habitat sensitivity and potential response of protected habitats to pressures. The indicators shall be regarded as tools for updating the environmental information. Management adaptation to changing environmental conditions requires a two track approach: first â the evaluation of effectiveness of measures undertaken, and second â the search for the information needed to undertake new actions. Both tasks shall be implemented with the use of indicators. Therefore, the focus was on the construction of indicators which are multidimensional, integrative, strongly assigned to climate change, i.e. evaluate climate change-related effects and impacts within the habitat/ecosystem. At the same time these indicators are relatively easy to apply for habitat monitoring and have a standardised methodology available. They also allow for updating the information contained in the maps. Climate change is indicated by climatic scenarios, covering both a short (a decade) and longer periods based upon climatic parameters (temperature and precipitation) measured at local meteorological stations. The response of wetland habitats is to be seen in the changes of water balance, soil and vegetation properties and in the changes of biodiversity of plant communities."
284,216,0.298,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"In this discourse, mining is problematic due to contamination from heavy metals. This is the origin of the need for efï¬ciency and recycling in water and energy consumption, and â given the environmental crisis â the need for environmental control that guarantees sustainable mining. In the case of water . . . it must be addressed through strict control over available resources.23 (Chilean politician, representative of the center-left) . . . it should be, as I say, with the least environmental impact.24 (Ecuadorian politician, progressive Congressman) However, this control and monitoring supposes the existence of a state that clearly intervenes and regulates the market, and a democratic citizenship that participates, monitors and combats corruption. As for energy, the fundamental semantic axis resides in the contrast of âcarbon energyâ with ârenewable energyâ. And in Chile . . . the energy grid is overly carbonized.25 (Chilean politician, representative of the left) Our indigenous discourse has always been to defend the rights of nature . . . For that reason the president has decided to change the energy grid, for example from thermoelectric to hydroelectric energy . . .26 (Ecuadorian indigenous leader, progressive representative) In summary, this model is based on a political proposal of sustainable development, which criticizes the environmental impact of mining but includes mining as a factor of development. It subjects mining to controls, rules and regulations, and seeks to encourage the sustainable consumption of water and energy by promoting efï¬ciency, recycling and a transition to renewable energy, including this transition within the mining sector itself. It proposes sustainable development with the clear intervention of the state in order to guarantee a market with clear and competitive rules. It intends to combat monopoly and corruption, and to stimulate citizen participation. In short, water and energy consumption is perceived as a political problem and not only one of technical management."

It proved yet again a very pleasant exercise for everyone involved. IRAS, at the same time, got a car with measurement equipment to travel through town in order to get additional environmental data, but at the time of this publication, we had not received the input and hence could not take it into account in our analysis. It took TNO over three months to analyze and interpret the data. The analysts acknowledged back that they were surprised that such a relatively small group of participants had generated such a gigantic mountain of data. Cross-referencing between questionnaires, activity logs, GPS and air quality data, all related to time, geographic position and characteristics of such location, made the interpretation very laborious and impossible to automate. Every backpack participant received their own private report about the TNO ï¬ndings. Additionally, TNO and AiREAS gave a workshop together in October 2015 with all of the participants. We wanted to share the general insights and see if people would be willing to use innovations to improve their awareness and interaction with public spaces when making personal decisions."

Six independent mechanisms (basic processes) were identiï¬ed in the case study. Several of these processes seemed âdiscrete,â such as developing a chain of causal links (A causes B; B causes C; â¦), the totality of which was precisely the causality behind Newtonâs thermal laws. The chain was primed by one previously identiï¬ed intuitive idea, and contained at its core another very important and previously identiï¬ed intuitive causal link. Other parts of the construction seemed less âlogical and scientiï¬c.â For example, the central intuitive causal link was expressed in overtly anthropomorphic ways (âthe objects in contact want to be in equilibrium, and are freaking out because they are so far apartâ). Remarkably, the anthropomorphism (âwantingâ and âfreaking outâ) gradually disappeared from the studentsâ talk, and, in the end, they had a very professional-sounding version of Newtonâs laws: The rate of temperature change is proportional to the difference in temperatures. The anthropomorphism seemed to be a scaffold and not a permanent part of the construction, just like scaffolds are critical, but they come and go in the construction of a house (and may, thus, never be seen in before-and-after studies!). 2.5.2"

118,581,0.298,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"nuclear energy, such as risk analysis, cost-benefit analysis, etc. How did we conduct this role? Was it sufficient? Or are there any other roles which we should perform for society? These are questions which we have to think about and find some answers. Iâm still convinced that the conventional role of nuclear professionals, providing information, is essential, since people need reliable, technical information to make decisions on nuclear policy and energy policy. But I also consider we have to be much more sensitive in our attitude towards the general public. Most technical information, such as simulations, calculations, or forecasts, contains some sort of uncertainties and assumptions which do not appear clearly when the outcomes are shown as numbers. Though some people are not accustomed to dealing with uncertainties or assumptions, we have to explain technical information, including uncertainties and assumptions, in a sincere and honest manner. Otherwise, information wonât be truly meaningful and we wonât be trusted in a real sense. In addition to the above conventional role, Iâm wondering if there are other roles which we should play. Since the culture of engineering is utilitarianism, our strongest assets and tools are based on a utilitarian way of thinking. But utilitarianism is not the only philosophy of modern society, especially in current Japan, and there are other major social values. Though Iâm not sure whether it is possible to justify use of nuclear energy without utilitarianism, it might be our role to facilitate discussions among people with different sets of values and to help them to bridge the gaps. At least, we have to understand various social values and gaps among them. The above are my thoughts on our role in society after Fukushima and I havenât yet reached any concrete conclusion. But at least, I have no doubt that we have to play a certain role in society and I consider we have to keep thinking about what our role is, not only with engineering methods but also with social scientific literacy."
36,526,0.298,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.7.3 Education/Outreach Education and outreach in local communities is essential to successful hunting management campaigns. Many hunters do not perceive bats as a limited resource and are unaware of the effect they may be having on bat speciesâ extinction risks. An obvious first step to bat conservation in hunted areas is therefore the dissemination of information on the bat population size, basic biology, and monitoring techniques, so that hunters can assess the impacts they are having. Local communities should understand the benefits of bats and the valuable ecological services they provide, including their contribution to forest regeneration through seed dispersal. Communities that appreciate bats may be more likely to pursue conservation management. If people understand the array of risks of ignoring declining populations, they will be more inclined to exert effort to protect bats. Local communities should also understand the human health risks of bat hunting and consumption. Bat handling, trade, preparation, and consumption by humans create a direct transmission route for disease spillover into human communities and warrants consideration in bat protection programs. Education about these risks is needed, as only a small percentage of participants in bat hunting and"

In the reform of 2013, this desideratum was reinforced, as stated notably in Art. 2 of Regulation No. 1380/2013: application of the ecosystem-based approach, fostering the collection of scientific data, decisions taken under the best available scientific advice, new strategy for discards, and coherence with the European Union environmental legislation.

231,1459,0.298,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Most of the effects of climate change at the Belgian coast relate to sea-level rise, resulting in higher storm flood levels, coastal erosion, and deterioration or loss of natural ecosystems, including wetlands. Other impacts associated with higher sea levels are rising groundwater levels and an increase in soil and groundwater salinity in coastal and estuarine areas. Freshwater lenses developed within the dunes are also vulnerable to sea-level rise, leading to threats to drinking water supplies through saltwater intrusion. Climate change will also affect ï¬sheries and coastal tourism (Lebbe et al. 2008; Van den Eynde et al. 2011). One of the most signiï¬cant social secondary effects is the number of people at risk due to flooding. Economic impacts result not only from direct damage, but also from indirect damage associated with the temporary suspension of production and loss of jobs (Van der Biest et al. 2008, 2009). The Belgian coastal adaptation strategy for coping with climate change aims at combining flood risk control with the development of ecosystem services (NCC 2010). For controlling flood risks along the Scheldt Estuary, the Sigma-plan has been developed. This provides for the creation of controlled flood zones along the estuary, combining safety against flooding with objectives related to recreation, nature and agriculture. An ambitious proposal for coastal adaptation has been launched by a group of private investors. The central idea is to combine the need of climate change adaptation with the development of new opportunities for the economy of the Belgian coastal zone. This plan was endorsed by the Flemish government that developed the three-track master plan Vlaamse Baaien (Vlaamse Overheid 2012). This master plan aims at (1) a safe and sustainable coastline with opportunities for economic development, (2) a resilient coastal ecosystem with opportunities for the development of"

At this point, the author would argue that an idea to remedy this problem might be found in the original context of âresilienceâ concept. Needless to say, âresilienceâ is the word originally used in the ï¬eld of psychology and psychiatry to describe, analyze and encourage the human beingsâ ability to adopt and cope with stress and adversity. In those ï¬elds, resilience is considered as an inherent ability of us, but, it is studied that it could be encouraged by appropriate support by relevant people and society, at the same time. Thus, if we extract some implications from this original context of âresilienceâ concept, we should recognize the importance of social healing process to remedy post-disaster emotional trauma of society and individuals. The process must be clinical and call for very intensive and grass-root but sometimes low-proï¬le efforts beside victims. Their damages need to be cured by psychological, bedside and ethical practices, while compensation, assistance funding, town reconstruction program and any other institutional and pragmatic supports are still important and effective in many cases. We need this kind of careful emotional treatments before we talk and do something about engineering resilience under the actual post-disaster situation like post â3.11â Japan. Furthermore, it is even required to apply the similar healing process to encourage the resilience of expert community, as the victimizerâs side. Japanese STS (Science and Technology Studies) researcher Ekou Yagi introduced her own experiences of âjust be there with victimizersâ after serious technological disasters, JR Fukuchiyama line train derail accident in 2005 and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in 2011 [13]. She points out that the members of victimizing companies/organizations of serious accidents also require emotional support to be proactive and to build sound and respectful relationship with victims and their families. She tried to be a supporter, not by doing something actively with them, but by just being beside them and hearing their voices calmly. She reported that the existence of such an escort person with the knowledge on their business (it was the advantage of her as a STS researcher) seemed to be supportive for âvictimizersâ and did encourage the positive signs of their own changes towards the rebuilt of public trust."

Athleteâs foot was described as a perverse consequence of the nationâs attempt to improve the health and fitness of its youth, especially with the burgeoning of college sports and improved hygiene facilities. The infection was met with the tools of modern public health propaganda, being presented in some instances as equivalent to a sexually transmitted disease, and by new methods of treatment produced by the pharmaceutical industry, first in a rash of proprietary medicines and then antifungal antibiotics. Thrush, the subject of our third chapter, was regarded at the start of the twentieth century as a disease of weak children, but moved in the medical and public view to a genital infection, principally of women and was linked mainly to alterations in the body due to pregnancy and lifestyle changes.47 We then discuss how, in the second half of the twentieth century, thrush was linked in different ways to the development of antibiotics. It was soon recognised as a side effect of penicillin therapy, while the search for new and better bacterial antibiotics led to the discovery of nystatin â the first modern antifungal antibiotic, which soon became a specific treatment for thrush. Systemic C. albicans infection, known as invasive candidiasis, became, paradoxically, more prevalent in patients taking bacterial antibiotics, but also in those with cancers, transplants and inflammatory conditions. This problem was met by a search for new antifungal drugs, with successes improving the institutional position of medical mycology. We end the chapter with a discussion of âThe Yeast Connectionâ phenomenon. In Chapter 4, we discuss the regionally specific fungal infections in the United States that came to the fore as a consequence of the economic development of certain regions in the South and Midwest, where population movement brought in non-immune groups who were vulnerable to endemic mycoses. The forms of economic development were also important, as new methods of production and types of industrial and domestic construction created new environmental conditions, and in some cases literally transformed and transported fungi-laden soil dust. In the same vein, we show how new technologies of food production, transportation and storage produced a new class of hazardous compounds â mycotoxins. In our final chapter, we discuss aspergillosis, the most serious of the invasive mycoses that have emerged from"

182,326,0.298,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"with humans in medical protective clothing. Here, animals and humans are portrayed in close proximity, in open air and/or muddy, messy situations, implying that the source of zoonotic disease risks are not solely the animals but the intimacy of humanâanimal relationships in these parts of the world. Wild animals appear in some of these photographs, usually large charismatic species, including ostriches, giraffes, seals, elephants, lions and great apes. They are depicted alone, or in about a third of the images with humans, usually as recipients of veterinary care, but occasionally as âhands and pawsâ, evoking the imagery seen in fig. 6.5, and the famous National Geographic image of Jane Goodall and a chimpanzee hand in hand. These images seem to be drawing on conservation and animal welfare campaigning to advance ideas of human care for, and custodianship of, animals.96 While occasionally wild animals appear in relation to zoonotic disease transmission, these are usually less sympathetic animals such as bats, at times manipulated to look more threatening.97 The prominence of wildlife in these images contrasts heavily with the published literature on OH, where beyond the generic category of âwild animalsâ, individual species barely feature. Eight photographs in the sample show animals as patients, with human clinicians working directly with them in one way or another. They are split evenly between images of dogs being cared for in clinical settings (by implication in the global North), and wild or agricultural species being cared for in the field (by implication in the global South). finally, 18 images of humans without animals feature. About half of these are pictures taken at conferences and other scientific or policy meetings, while most of the rest depict people working in laboratories. With the exception of a still from the 2011 film Contagion, no images of human patients were found. Indeed, the plot of Contagion, which plays out the imagined scenario of an emerging infectious disease pandemic, can be seen as part of a broader cultural case for OH. The film"

For the Amazon Fund, the government of Brazil pledged to allocate US$500 million, but it is estimated that an additional investment of US$1 billion per year would be required to fully implement the plan (Meyer, 2010). Brazil has the technical capacity to monitor changes in forest cover through remote-sensing technology and to ensure transparency to deal with the fund through institutional structures and mechanisms. By 2008, Brazil had already put in place some of the conditions to be enabled by Phase 1. This in part explains Norwayâs support of the Amazon Fund, which placed Brazil in phases 2 and 3. The Norwegian support of the Fund is contingent on demonstrating avoided deforestation against a historical baseline (results-based payments). Norwayâs involvement is also based on ideas of economic rationality, altruism and self-interest9 as a humanitarian/environmental protection actor. The establishment of the Brazilian Amazon Fund can be explained by the combined effect of the activities and initiatives of NGOs, state governors in the Amazon region, and politicians in key positions (the president and the minister of the environment). Norwegian support through Norwayâs International Forest and Climate Initiative (NIFCI) gave the scheme the ï¬nal thrust to get the fund started. The Amazon Fund is important for advancing the Brazilian approach to REDD. This approach is well established in existing Brazilian institutions and is in accord with the countryâs views and priorities. Brazilâs REDD strategy has been characterized by a strong involvement of the central government, but NGOs and lower levels of the public administration have also played a role. The advanced technical capacity of Brazil in terms of remote-sensing and the establishment of a historical baseline of forest cover place the country in a privileged position in regard to the phased approach promoted at the international level. The alliance of Brazil and Norway for ï¬nancing the Amazon Fund has given Brazilâs strategy a very advantageous starting point. Brazilâs approach to ï¬nancing REDD efforts has been based on the idea of a centralized fund that would allow the country to avoid the voluntary carbon market for ï¬nancing reduced deforestation. However, the growing involvements of other networks, particularly those in which governors of the Amazon states are involved, have pushed the country towards additional mechanisms for ï¬nancing avoided deforestation, particularly through their partnership with the governors of California and Illinois.10"
271,613,0.298,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"which operate by the same mediated, fluctuating logic. This nesting is evident in the chapters in the second part, which deal with institutions and organizations such as journalism, blogging, schools and the Church. The nested view is most effective, however, when applied to more fluid domains. The interweaving of different figurations helps us understand bottom-up social action, such as the repair cafÃ©s discussed by KannengieÃer (Chap. 5) or the hacker collectives discussed by Kubitschko (Chap. 4). Furthermore, the analysis of everyday mediated and unmediated interactions, such as the social life in cities as analyzed by Hepp et al. (Chap. 3), is much enlightened by this layered approach. Finally, this interweaving sheds light on the interconnectedness of global and local, as shown by Robel and Marszolek (Chap. 7). This nested nature of figurations can also be extended downwards, to everyday interactions or even to individual or intra-individual level: the formation of self and identity, the expression of emotions, the regulation of bodies. The theoretical agenda certainly allows for this. However, the focus seems to be more on the upwards connection, from microtowards meso- and macro-levels, rather than across micro-levels. Every now and then, the chapters offer tantalizing glimpses of an extension towards the shaping of selves and the role of emotions in these figurations. For instance, Wolf and Wudarski discuss the emergence of new, informal ways of learning, and new forms of expertise in online gaming (Chap. 6). Friemel and Bixler show how adolescents bond while communicating through media, about media (Chap. 8). Pritzlaff-Scheele and Nullmeier show that people (sadly) have more trouble reaching decisions in online settings (Chap. 12). In these cases, the figurations expand upwards, towards wider societal networks, but also downwards, towards the shaping of emotions and identities. Throughout the volume, authors show how people and media come together in figurations through practice. The practice-based approach captures peopleâs simultaneous engagement with various media and other people, highlighting not only the interweaving, but also the coconstitution3 of figurations through people and media. The focus on practice means that media and people are seen simultaneously, without one having analytical or causal precedence over the other. In some chapters, the analytical focus on practice is combined with the nesting of figurations on different levelsâespecially Hepp et al. (Chap. 3); Kubitschko (Chap. 4), Kramp and Loosen (Chap. 9); Breiter and Ruhe (Chap. 13); Friemel and Bixler (Chap. 8). In these cases, the new figurational"

Several transition initiatives aim to change nature perceptions, reinforce human-nature relationships or promote eco-friendly lifestyles and practices. Below we highlight a couple of initiatives that are active in promoting or supporting naturebased solutions: The Heempark The Heemparkis a unique example of a Public â Civic Partnership as it combines city supported (Environment and Nature Centre) and volunteer activities (Heempark vzw) in a collaborative and mutually beneficial way. The Heempark was initiated in 1985 by a group of local volunteers who aimed to safeguard the local agricultural heritage through the Heempark model â a combination of demo sites of local agricultural practice with a clear focus on environmental sustainability. When the number of visitors increased and the entire initiative grew over the heads of the volunteers, the City supported with personnel, infrastructure and an educational program for schools and associations. At the moment the Heempark has about 90 members and approximately 35 active volunteers that maintain the gardens and organise a wide variety of activities to promote reconnection of people to nature and increase environmental awareness and engagement. Activities include cooking classes of organic food with autistic children, sessions about herbs, bees and vegetables, making honey, building eco-friendly gardens and so on. Our findings show that the Heempark is a hotspot when it comes to connecting initiatives and reconnecting people to nature. It houses 350 educational groups while attracting approximately 10.000 visitors a year (Photo 5.5). The Bee Plan The Bee plan is a multi-stakeholder initiative to turn the city of Genk into a bee friendly city. It originated in 2013 when two concerned citizens organised an open environmental council meeting showcasing the documentary âMore than honeyâ. Afterwards, the 60 people present brainstormed about what they could do in the city to improve conditions for bees and all ideas were gathered. To take this further, a working group was set up involving beekeepers, city services, environmental organisations and engaged civilians who developed a âBee planâ for the city of Genk that was approved by the bench of aldermen in February 2014. The plan aims to strengthen the bee populations in the city region by (1) improving the"

72,52,0.297,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"relevant to contemporary social innovation policy and discussions about the diffusion of social innovations. Another approach to researching social innovation, exemplified in Chapter 2, is the use of comparative historical case studies. McGowan and Westley introduce a theoretical and methodological framework based on three propositions: first, that new social phenomena create the opportunity for changes to social relations and structures by enabling glimpses into the âadjacent possibleâ; second, that agentsâ behaviour and roles within social innovation can be divided into three categories â poets, debaters and designers â whose efforts are complementary; and finally, that to achieve broad, lasting change, the innovation in question must cross multiple scales â from the niche (micro) level to the (macro) landscape level. The authors explore these frameworks through a case study on the emergence of the intelligence test. This illustrates the three elements within the authorsâ theoretical framework and also shows how social innovation is culturally contingent. The ideas that inspired the development of the intelligence test, such as Social Darwinism, are now widely viewed as profoundly perverse. In 2011, the Centre de recherche sur les innovations sociales (Center for Research on Social Innovations â CRISES) started to build a database of social innovations. In Chapter 3, Bouchard et al. examine the uses and the challenges of building such a database. Since research on social innovation is generally conducted through case studies, it is difficult to carry out macro-sociological analysis of the social transformations that accompany these innovations, and results cannot be generalised. The database of social innovations aims to fill this gap and to enable the longitudinal, sectoral and spatial analysis of social innovation in the context of Quebec. The process of building a database represents an innovative approach to the research of social innovation, and the authors point to a number of methodological, theoretical and epistemological challenges associated with such a task. Part II explores some of the ways in which social innovations reconfigure relations between civil society, the state and the market. Indeed, the boundaries between these sectors are becoming increasingly porous and one of the striking features of social innovations is their ability to combine the traditionally disparate logics of the private, public and civil society sectors. In Chapter 4, Jenson examines some of the varied meanings of the âquasi-conceptâ of social innovation, and argues that one of its major contributions is to provide a novel way to reorganise market relations in the post-neoliberal world. The âwelfare diamondâ is a heuristic device"
214,395,0.297,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"But broadly, there is the interesting property that the wisdom of crowds applies. If the models have random mistakes and their biases are uncorrelated, then the average of the models (the multi-model mean) tends to be better than most of the models. This is a big âif,â and many models have dependencies, but in practice (and in synthetic statistical tests), because the climate system is complicated, and most models meet basic measures of representing the system (conservation of energy and mass), the multi-model mean is usually a pretty good statistic. This makes ensembles quite valuable. One thing to remember is that there is lots of chaotic internal variability in the climate system, and the observed record is only one possible realization of that internal variability. There may or may not be an El NiÃ±o event this year, but the possibility is that there could have been. So with the real climate system, we have only one ensemble. We expect models to be different from observations in any given year, or even decade, if they are fully coupled and internally consistent. This also confounds prediction and evaluation. It is one reason why the present and the past do not fully constrain the future (see box). Why the Present and Past DO NOT Constrain the Future It is often assumed that a model must be able to represent the present (or past climate) correctly to represent the future. This is true. However, while necessary, it is not a sufï¬cient condition to constrain the future. Suppose that a model represents the present for the wrong reasons. Perhaps there is a large compensation of errors: Maybe an error in the radiation code letting in too much energy is compensated for by an error in the sea-ice model that reflects too much energy. If the planet warms up, the sea ice will go away, but the error in the radiation code will remain. It is also assumed that the more accurate a model is at representing the present (or the past), the better it will be at representing the future. This is also true, but it requires that âbetterâ representations be for those areas that matter for future climate, and this is not necessarily the case. What does that mean in practice? Letâs say you have two measures of model performance. One is based on clouds, and one is based on temperature. If model A scores 80 % on both temperature and clouds relative to observations, and model B scores 100 % on clouds but 20 % on temperature, then a simple average score says that model A scores 80 % and model B scores 60 %. But if present clouds are more important for future climate than temperature, model B may be better. In the previous example, the present-day model may score well on sea ice and lower on the radiation code, but the radiation code is more important for the future. Also, knowing the mean state today does not imply that you can predict the change in that state accurately in the future. It is usually a good indicator, but not guaranteed. That covers why the present does not necessarily constrain the future. Because with present climate we do not know what the response to a forcing (i.e., feedbacks) will be. But what about using the past: If we know"

In this chapter, we describe the basics of how climate models are evaluated and how they are tested. The language and terms used in this discussion can be confusing. For example, the terms validation and evaluation are often used to mean different things, and a projection is not the same as a forecast. We will see why shortly.

38,275,0.297,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS; www.ioos.noaa.gov). Some international efforts have a regional focus. For example, the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP), under the auspices of the Arctic Council, has an Arctic Marine Biodiversity Monitoring Plan (www.caff.is/marine). Dornelas et al. (2014) compiled the ï¬rst global time-series data base for analysis of trends in marine biodiversity. As described earlier, biodiversity data are available for many taxa and regions of the world and the challenge remains to access, compile and curate these data. A major obstacle is therefore not only the difï¬culty in maintaining funding for monitoring or data synthesis efforts, but fostering motivation for institutes and scientists to publish their data and overcoming communication and cultural differences. Building collaborative networks may be one means to begin to surmount these challenges to collate data across scientists, institutions, and data repositories. While efforts to collate the data that has been collected by the global monitoring community is certainly the best hope for generating historical knowledge, purpose-built global biodiversity platforms are fundamental for ensuring the capacity to track biodiversity change into the future. For example, MarineGEO (Duffy 2014) is establishing observatories where multiple components of biodiversity, including benthic and pelagic communities and food webs, will be monitored using globally standardised methods and experimentation, including artiï¬cial substrata (e.g., ARMS). Associated initiatives focus on global studies on seagrass (http://zenscience.org/about-zen; Reynolds et al. 2014) and kelp (www.kelpecosystems.org) habitats. Standard methods for these habitats have been published (e.g., Edgar et al. 2001; Davies et al. 2001). Such projects may utilise the Zooniverse platform for citizen science crowd sourcing (www.zooniverse.org). Global sampling of surface water marine microbes is also underway utilising genomic methods, including synchronised sampling of hundreds of stations on âOcean Sampling Dayâ (www.microb3.eu/osd) (e.g., Davies et al. 2012a, b; Kopf et al. 2015). These and related research into molecular indicators may ï¬ll gaps that complement more conventional metrics of biodiversity (Leray and Knowlton 2015). Although there are issues to be resolved in the interpretation of DNA found in the environment (eDNA), including contamination, accuracy of matching results to species, and uncertainty about live versus dead material, it may prove invaluable in detecting rare and/or microscopic species that are otherwise hard to sample (Thomsen and Willerslev 2015). There are two established and several emerging globally coordinated marine biodiversity monitoring programmes, covering surface plankton (CPR), mobile rocky and coral reef fauna (RLS), seagrass and kelp habitats, and pelagic microbes. There are similar sampling methods used internationally for other guilds of species; including mammals, whale sharks and birds; small ï¬sh and crustaceans in ï¬shery trawls; macro-invertebrate infauna of coastal sediments; and sessile and sedentary biota on rocky seashores. For example, programmes such as the ICES North Sea Benthos Survey (e.g., Duineveld et al. 1991; Basford et al. 1993) and NaGISA (Benedetti-Cecchi et al. 2010; Cruz-Motta et al. 2010; Konar et al. 2010; Pohle et al. 2011; Miloslavich et al. 2013) could be continued and expanded internationally. NaGISA was one of several projects within the decade-long Census of Marine Life,"
258,236,0.297,New Horizons for Asian Museums and Museology,"As is discussed above, our efforts to arrive at a mutual agreement on, or understanding of, a âbetter relationship of coexistence between humans and lakesâ is at a rather primitive stage. Nevertheless, some consensus among most regional actors has surely been found. For instance, a public opinion poll in Shiga Prefecture found that the local political topics ranked as the top three in terms of satisfaction level are âenvironmental arrangements that enable experiences of nature in our own backyard,â âfood security,â and âmaintenance of beautiful rural landscapes and green forestsâ (Shiga Prefecture 2014). This indicates that many residents regard the satisfaction with these as âgoodâ and the related political measures as having been successfully worked out. Interestingly, they are all deeply associated with sustainable relationships between humans and nature in the Lake Biwa watershed. Therefore, it seems that the concept of sustainability can be accepted as a common âgoodâ by most residents in Shiga Prefecture. Aspirations for sustainability usually come from the recognition that it has been impaired. Many of us may feel that nature has retreated from our living areas, food security has been threatened, and the landscapes around farming and mountain villages have deteriorated, at least that such was the case in the past. Such experiences direct us to regenerating a sustainable relationship between humans and nature. Because such regeneration cannot be a simple restoration to the original state, it requires exploratory trials and social innovations, i.e., new strategies, concepts, ideas, and organizations that meet social needs. With this in mind, I will now introduce and analyze a case in which the Lake Biwa Museum contributed to a social activity aimed at regenerating a sustainable relationship with Lake Biwa. In 2001, Shiga Prefecture started its âSakana-no-yurikago-suidenâ project, that is, âRestoration of Fish Breeding in Paddy Fields,â around Lake Biwa. This project aims at rural environmental improvement by encouraging the resumption of ï¬sh migration between rice paddies and Lake Biwa. Land consolidation programs executed between the 1960s and 1980s raised the level of the rice paddies, and therefore generated considerable vertical drops (usually more than a meter) between the rice paddies and the water surface of the drainage canals. As a consequence, it became impossible for ï¬sh to enter the paddies for spawning. To remedy this situation, participating rural communities usually set ï¬sh-ladder cascades that work by elevating the water level of the upper reaches of a drainage canal through the installation of a series of successively higher ï¬ashboards; this sort of installation enables ï¬sh to enter the paddies adjacent to the canal by way of their drains (Fig. 2). By 2011, this program had expanded to about 1.2 km2 of paddy ï¬elds (Ohtsuka 2014)."

(2014) and elaborated in Chap. 2 of this volume. The framework groups the causes of land degradation in two categories; proximate biophysical causes and underlying causes. These two categories act together hence resulting in different levels of land degradationâwhich in turn determines the effects (on-site or off-site), on the ecosystem services and the beneï¬ts humans derive from those services. Actors could take action to control the causes, levels and effects of land degradation. For a further comprehensive discussion on the conceptual framework, refer to Chap. 2 of this volume."

When measures were agreed though, the regulatory strength of the EU was much greater than in the 1960s, even though the complex science-policy interface in EU legislation, placing a very strong burden of proof for measures, led to significant policy delays.13 When it comes to the policy approach, the PBDE group has been regulated mainly on the basis of the chemicals and polluter-oriented policy, not based on an environmental approach, and even less so on a precautionary approach. The latter is particularly true for decaBDE, where action was stalled during lengthy and politicised decision-making and legal processes (Eriksson et al. 2010a, 2010b). The environment-oriented approaches in the case of MSFD, for example, have so far not led to significant phase-out measures in themselves, and there are obvious implementation problems. In the case of WFD, in its third implementation report, the European Commission was unable to even establish a baseline for the chemical status of surface waters due to data gaps and insufficient monitoring (more than 40 % of surface water bodies in the EU were reported as having âunknown chemical statusâ) making it very difficult to estimate the EU-wide or Baltic Sea situation (European Commission 2012). Similarly, while BSAP is based on EAM (in theory linking hazardous substances, negatively, to biodiversity objectives on the one hand and to eutrophication on the other, where goal achievement may lead to higher concentrations of pollutants in biota), the practical responses to these insights still have to be implemented broadly. Nevertheless, BSAP sets out to link the work of HELCOM-identified substances to the national implementation plans under WFD, thereby helping policy efficiency in practice. More generally, the implementation of BSAP may help to broaden the implementation of WFD in EU Member States, and conversely, some environment-oriented EU policies may then be implemented in the HELCOM context. As for PCBs, there is thus a positive interplay between EU and HELCOM policies, when it comes to BFRs."

In the Macedon Ranges local government area the future climate is likely to include more hot days, less rainfall and run-off and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as drought, flash flooding and wildfire. The purpose of this project was to identify, analyse and evaluate climate change risks and develop an adaptation plan that would assist the Macedon Ranges Shire Council on the outskirts of Melbourne begin to plan for likely impacts arising from climate change. The development of the adaptation plan employed a best practice risk management approach in line with AS/NZS 31000:2009 and AS 5334:2013 and took and whole-of-council approach. Undertaking a risk assessment approach to climate change adaptation planning for a peri-urban local government area was successful. The approach assisted council to build capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment and define their area of operation, influence and responsibility in regards to adaptation actions and the role of other external stakeholders. Further, it helped them to integrate the risks and associated adaptation options directly into the existing risk register system and understand the relativity of climate risks to non-climate risks that the council faces, such as land use change, increasing proportions of absentee landholders and an ageing demographic.

Among these, âwater issues are one of the major problems that humanity must solve for its survival.â This maxim was a key conclusion reached by top-level decision-makers at the ï¬rst Asia Paciï¬c Water Summit in December 2007, marking the ï¬rst time in history that all Asian states met to discuss water issues. This statement does more than characterize the Asian situation. It applies to our entire globe. Water managers and scientists are aware that sustainably managing a fundamental resource like water requires rigorous scientiï¬c data and analysis to understand aquatic ecosystem functioning. Proper sustainable management requires that we know the âquantityâ and âqualityâ of a water source. This chapter describes the basics of the âqualitative aspectsâ of water monitoring and management, namely, the biomonitoring and the assessment of âriver quality.â Following centuries of human impacts on aquatic resources, monitoring of water chemistry has become a customary practice in many countries. The fundamental scientiï¬c aspects of sustainable water management in many areas of the world are still quite poorly understood, and biological monitoring tools are lacking for many developing and transitional countries (Bere and Nyamupingidza 2013). In recent decades, attempts to develop monitoring methodologies are increasing rapidly and have generated biological assessment and monitoring of aquatic resources that are reliable enough to be included in state monitoring programs in Europe, the United States, Australia, and South Africa.

A technical failure in the electricity infrastructure may lead to a blackout and further cascading effects [4]. (3) An infrastructure may be a resource for response and mitigation actions. This might not be immediately obvious, but may come as a late insight when this infrastructure fails or even gets destroyed [5]. An example is a bridge in eastern Germany that was washed away by a fluvial flood. The local responders were no longer able to send forces to the other riverside, and did not have an alternative plan for that situation. In most cases, it is not possible for crisis managers to revert a decision or an action already takenâin reality. However, in simulation it is possible to do exactly this: âgo back in timeâ and explore a different course of action. This allows answering hypothetical questions like âWhat would happen if I take a different decision or follow a different course of action?â. Therefore, this is also sometimes called âwhat-if analysisâ. Since this type of what-if analysis requires simulation, it is rather suited for training purposes. Providing such what-if analysis as a capability to end-users is the essential idea behind the training system CIPRTrainer, which we will present in detail in the main part of this chapter. CIPRTrainer is the software system that enables crisis managers to train decision-making in crises and emergencies involving cascading effects of CIs. CIPRTrainer constitutes an unprecedented training opportunity that complements standard command post, table-top, or physical exercises. The expected beneï¬ts would be increased awareness of crisis managers of the role and behaviour of interconnected CIs in disasters, emergencies, and crisis situations, and a better understanding of possible consequences of scenario evolution and the influence of own actions. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. We continue with briefly embedding the CIPRTrainer approach to what-if analysis into the state of the art and then proceed with characterising the types of complex crisis scenarios that we designed for the CIPRTrainer prototype. Then we will give an overview of the building blocks of CIPRTrainer, explaining how we technically realised it. The following section will then provide an overview of how we realised impact and consequence analysis (CA) for the global assessment of damages and how it is employed for what-if analysis. We continue with explaining how CIPRTrainer is actually used and with an example of a training session. An outlook on the next version of CIPRTrainer and a conclusion end this chapter. For reference, we included a list of acronyms and a bibliography."
187,401,0.297,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"counteracting a disaster is a matter of available resources, remaining time, and situation of the disaster (like location and effects/impacts of incidents). The available resources at any given point in time limit the possibilities of response and mitigation actions. The situation of the disaster determines what would need to be done to counteract (or ï¬ght) it. Thus it is important to keep track of the used resources and the evolution of the disaster. Responders and action forces are considered and modelled as resources. In a uniform way, the attributes of the situation of the disaster are also modelled as âresourcesâ. This is a legacy from using SyMo in the military context. The disaster could be considered a âfoeâ and the responders as âfriendâ. Both have resources and âuseâ them to âï¬ghtâ each other. For modelling the disaster incidents and the disaster management and response actions in the affected area, it is important to also know the locations of the resources. In order to facilitate the modelling in this respect, we start with partitioning the area where the disaster happens into zones. Using zones allows a simpler and quicker"

He found no fault in the âthorough, scientific and conscientiousâ response of the teachers, the medical officer or the managers.62 He made recommendations, but the problem persisted. Two years later, in May 1893, the school turned to another London specialist, Dr Alfred Eddowes. He found 47 cases and, while agreeing that the medical officer was highly competent, he nevertheless recommended that he took overall control, as with ringworm âdetailâ was all important.63 He visited once a fortnight over four months, after which he claimed to have cured 25 children and improved the remainder; eventual eradication seemed inevitable.64 Policies for ringworm were developed along similar lines to diphtheria and scarlet fever, although it was much less serious, because of its impact on sufferers and their families. It became, quite literally, a social disease. Infected children were given special status and treatment because they seemed manifestly âuncleanâ and stigmatised by other children and their families, and by neighbours. In addition, teachers and doctors expressed concerns about the consequences of exclusion for the individual, their family and the future mental fitness of the nation. Abraham and Eddowes explained the issues in 1894. Now that school attendance is compulsory and that the well-caredfor children of poor but respectable families often have to associate at school with those of the dirtiest and most careless classes of the community it is a moral duty that all reasonable precautions should be"

The use of GIS to support aquaculture development and planning has a long tradition (Kapetsky et al. 1990) and the identiï¬cation of suitable sites for aquaculture has been among the most frequent applications of GIS (Fisher and Rahel 2004). In recent years, the use and relevance of spatial data in supporting informed decision making in MSP has been increasingly demonstrated (Caldow et al. 2015). For instance, the development of GIS data layers to inform MSP includes: the mapping of sensitivity of seabirds to offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014); the assessment of potential whale interactions with shipping (Petruny et al. 2014); the mapping of offshore (Campbell et al. 2014) and inshore (Breen et al. 2015) ï¬shing activity; or the mapping of ethnographic information (Sullivan et al. 2015). Decision makers and planners are most likely to require spatial data layers at the development stage of a MSP process, enabling them to explore the data, and develop and evaluate planning scenarios (StelzenmÃ¼ller et al. 2012)."

77,18,0.297,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"et al. 2007; Graham 2002; Kuh et al. 2003). These models anticipate different patterns and therefore help clarify the mechanisms through which individualsâ multiple trajectories interact. The critical period model assumes that part of the differences in health observed across social groups is explained by exposures occurring in specific periods of development. Deprivation, illness, divorce, risk behaviours (for example smoking, unbalanced diet) are such exposures. Because of their timing, hitting individuals in those critical periods of their life course, these events might lead to irreversible damages or diseases (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Marmot and Wadsworth 1997). At first, critical periods have been chiefly related to the biological, cognitive and psychosocial development during foetal life, infancy and childhood. The biological programming hypothesis formulated by David Barker (1997) suggests that poor nutrition during foetal life is associated with increased risk of diseases in adult life. Consequently, authors have suggested that other critical periods for psychosocial and social development may be important for health. Examples include entry into the labour market, leaving the parental home, establishing oneâs own residence, the transition to parenthood, job insecurity, or exit from the labour market (Bartley et al. 1997). In this volume, the chapter by Johnson et al. dedicated to body size and cardio-metabolic health examines the influences on trajectories of critical periods and transitions, occurring both at the biological and behavioural level. Since social scientists consider that the term âcritical periodâ primarily resonates with biological determinism, they prefer the notion of âsensitive periodâ (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Bornstein 1989; Halfon and Hochstein 2002), or âtime associated vulnerabilityâ (Wadsworth 1999). These propose a less deterministic model, where an exposure in a particular period of the life span increases the risk of but does not necessarily result in irreversible damage. The pathway model hypothesises that the effect of early disadvantage is indirect (Graham 2002). It highlights the different factors, such as lifestyles, educational achievement, social class, health behaviours that can act as mediators between early life social situations and adult health. For example, childhood adversity might restrict educational opportunities which in turn restrict socioeconomic wealth and resources, which in turn influence health behaviours, resulting in poorer health in late life. This model considers that the effect of early life factors on health later in life can be modified to some extent by circumstances occurring at various life stages (Power and Hertzman 1997). The metaphor of the domino aptly summarises the pathway model, also called the âtriggerâ model. The accumulation model suggests that life course exposure to adverse environmental and socioeconomic conditions and to health damaging behaviours accumulate over time. Two main fields can be identified: first, the accumulative risk model examines the sum of adverse exposures and risks in the lives of individuals and how these have an increasing influence on health outcomes over time. Second, the cumulative advantage and disadvantage model considers that those with advantaged origins tend to experience subsequent advantageous life course trajectories (OâRand 1996, 2009), resulting in increasing differences with underprivileged groups over time (Dannefer 2003). This model emphasizes how advantaging or disadvantaging"

302,310,0.297,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"A growing body of research has investigated the impacts of microplastics on biota, which may involve direct and indirect processes (e.g., physical blockage caused by ingested particles, as well as their ability to transport harmful compounds, pathogens, and algae) [2, 8â10]. Even so, little is known about the ecological effects of microplastics within freshwaters [10]. For example, while microplastic-associated microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and picoeukaryotic) assemblages are likely to profoundly influence the distribution, impacts, and fate of these pollutants, research into this topic has focused on marine environments [11â13]. In streams and other habitats, biofilms1 are primary sites for carbon and nutrient transformations and form the base of food webs, contributing to local and global ecosystem functioning [14]. As they are also essential to pollutant biodegradation, an improved knowledge of microbial-microplastic interactions is required to predict the environmental impacts of plastic debris [15]. Investigating this topic could inform the development of solutions to manage plastic pollution by determining how it affects processes including microbially mediated primary production and interactions between plastic-associated (âplastisphereâ) taxa and other organisms [11, 12, 16, 17]. It could also lead to insights concerning the biodegradability of plastic litter and facilitate the development of new approaches to plastic disposal and/or recycling [18]. Freshwater and marine habitats share a number of features, but there are also differences between them that may affect the development and activities of plastisphere consortia. To facilitate investigation of this topic, findings based on marine plastisphere research are compared with those available for freshwaters. Following an assessment of recent discoveries concerning the formation and distribution of plastic-associated biofilms, our knowledge concerning their ecological roles and ability to drive processes including polymer biodegradation is considered. Finally, some of the main knowledge gaps in plastisphere research are discussed and used to highlight methodological advances in microbial ecology that could be used to improve our understanding of microbial-microplastic interactions."

Climate change is also having diverse systemic effects often related to increasing aridity. As rangelands become more economically developed pastoral livelihoods may diversify, food security can improve, and commercial livestock production expands, but wealth stratification widens. Some significant upgrades in rural infrastructure and public service delivery have occurred; telecommunications are markedly improved overall due to widespread adoption of mobile phones. Pressures from grazing, farming, mining, and other land usesâ combined with droughtâcan ignite local conflicts over resources, although the intensity and scope of conflicts markedly varies across our case-study sites. Pastoralists and their herds have become more sedentary overall due to many factors, and this can undermine traditional risk-management tactics based on mobility. Remote rangelands still offer safe havens for insurgents, warlords, and criminals especially in countries where policing remains weak; the resulting civil strife can undermine commerce and public safety. There has been tremendous growth in knowledge concerning developing-country rangelands since 1990, but this has not often translated into improved environmental stewardship or an enhanced wellbeing for rangeland dwellers. Some examples of demonstrable impact are described, and these typically have involved longer-term investments in capacity building for pastoralists, local professionals, and other stakeholders. Research is shifting from ecologically centered to more human-centered issues; traditional academic approaches are often being augmented with participatory, community-based engagement. Building human or social capital in ways that are integrated with improved natural resource stewardship offers the greatest returns on research investment.

180,89,0.296,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Legal cases since 1890 had allowed states to require citizens be vaccinated, but around the turn of the century, limits to that right began appearing that included a âpresent dangerâ standard requiring a real and immediate threat and adherence to the harm avoidance principle protecting citizens from undue burden as much as possible (Willrich 2011). Jacobson has endured as a fundamental philosophical foundation of the reconciliation of individual interests with those of the publicâs health in a political system emphasizing liberal individualism. Despite the limitations of the facts in Jacobson, it has been interpreted in many ways to support numerous public health activities over the past century. Notably, the Supreme Court did not require that otherwise healthy citizens submit to vaccination, only that it was constitutional to require citizens to be vaccinated or pay a fine. Also, while the Court found that a lack of a health exception to the vaccination mandate would be unconstitutional, it did not grant Jacobson this exception for himself. However, as with so many examples in the lexicon of medical ethics, one of the most important practical effects of historical cases is how they have been interpreted and applied to future circumstances. Part of Jacobsonâs legacy has been the Courtâs âcommunity oriented philosophyâ based in social-contract (or compact) theory (Gostin 2005, 578): âa fundamental principle of the social compact [is] that the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for âthe common good â¦.ââ (Jacobson v.

Against our expectations and current predictive capabilities something harmful and possibly catastrophic happened. Why can we not prevent unexpected emergence by design? While the engineering process is indeed responsible for the interaction abilities of the CSs, CPSoSs are also open systems that interact with their environment. This environment of a CPSoS may change over time and/or might be insufï¬ciently understood, i.e., in general we cannot be certain that our models of the CPSoS environment are complete. Also the boundary of a CPSoS is dynamic and influences how the CPSoS environment affects the CPSoS itself. For example, consider a fault-tolerant CPSoS: If the number of its redundant CSs is small, an environment that causes intermittent faults in CSs at a constant rate (e.g., radiation) is much more hostile than compared to the same CPSoS where the number of redundant CSs is large. An evolving CPSoS attempts to adapt to changes in its environment (real changes or a changed understanding of the environment). Consequently, there are two co-dependent causes that enable the occurrence of unexpected detrimental emergence in CPSoSs: â¢ An evolutionary step that changes how CSs interact, and â¢ a change in the CPSoS environment and/or hidden channels."

221,443,0.296,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Group II. Following UNFCCC establishment, this seminar has focused not only on science and continues to function as a forum for knowledge exchange amongst Asiaâs climate change policymakers and related international organisations on responses to the UNFCCC. Meetings rotate within Asian nations and the 23rd was held in 2014. A Permanent Research-Dedicated Institution to Lead Environmental Research in Asia Under a prime ministerial initiative after the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) was established in 1998. IGES is an institute dedicated to conducting research on environmental issues in Asia. With a staff of about 200, including researchers from both within and outside Asia and management, it operates to maintain the various cooperative research networks and implement research activities that are mainly focused on Asia. Sharing Scientific Bases for Policymaking As shown in Fig. 12.2, a substantial amount of scientific data and assessment methodologies are required for policymaking in response to climate change. Of such, accurate ascertainment of GHG emissions and inventory work are particularly important. In recognition of thisâand of the importance of setting fundamental processes at an early stageâ GoJ, upon the request of the IPCC, established the Technical Support Unit (TSU) of the IPCC Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories at IGES in 1999. The IGES research units, in cooperation with the IPCC TSU and researchers from other Asian nations, led the task of amassing emission factors for Asiaâs unique forest soil and rice fields. In 2002, the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Office of Japan (GIO) was established in the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES). Using this office as a base, GoJ, in cooperation with IPCC TSU and the UNFCCC, launched the âWorkshop on Greenhouse Gas Inventories in Asia (WGIA)â in order to build capacity with the goal of ascertaining of GHG emissions throughout Asia. This workshop, which is hosted in a round-robin fashion by Asian countries, pairs up policymakers and researchers to form research communities that can maintain scientific accuracy over the long term. The latest data shared at the workshops is also reflected in national communications and policy formation in each country. The year 2014 marked the 13th year of this workshop, and since 2013, when BUR became obligatory, it has attracted over 120 delegates. These workshops have greatly contributed to estimating GHG emissions in Asia based on sharing of QA/QC methods and mutual learning. Consistent Support for Policy Formulation Based on Integrated Assessment Models The application of integrated assessment models is indispensable in refining and coalescing the ideas of disparate ministries and agencies into consistent plans and policies for individual countries, including NAMAs and INDCs. The National Institute for Environmental Studies and Kyoto University began developing the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) for climate policy in 1990, the goal of which is to promote its use in Asian countries, and joint research with China and India has taken place.

347,216,0.296,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"improved hydrographical measurements and navigation charts, not only in domestic waters but also in collaboration with neighbouring countries, have been successfully undertaken (Hassler 2011). The global features of marine oil transportation are not what is important, but rather the fact that the country carrying the costs is also the prime beneficiary of the undertaken project. Whether to make this investment or not thus becomes an issue of domestic cost-benefit analysis which does not need to turn into a tragedy of the commons. Basically, it then becomes a question for the authorities in that country to decide how to finance this investment. Second, different countries will benefit disproportionally from most kinds of pollution control. Countries with extended coastlines close to major marine traffic lanes, for example, are typically more vulnerable to oil spills. It could be expected that these countries would be more proactive vis-Ã -vis stricter regulations, everything else being equal. Not only would these countries be expected to undertake measures having primarily local effects as described above, but proactive positions in relation to international regulation would also be anticipated. Considering that lobbying for stricter international regulation is typically not costly in relation to what could be gained in case of successful interventions, there is no reason to expect barriers for collective action in these cases, given that domestic interests are sufficiently strong. This is most likely one important reason why Sweden and Finland have been strong proponents of stricter international regulations with regard to environmental hazards in the Baltic Sea, not only when it comes to marine oil transportation but to most other threats to the integrity of Baltic Sea ecosystems as well. In a similar manner, but conversely, countries with large stakes in marine oil transportation could be more hesitant to accept costly measures to reduce risks of oil spills. This would, according to the logic of collective action rationality, especially apply to stricter international regulations since these might threaten economic interests. On the other hand, local improvement in, for example, port facilities or hydrographical charts could be more appealing for countries in geographically vulnerable situations. Third, and finally, not only interests matter, but capability as well. Countries with more resources, know-how and experience could be expected to be more proactive in relation to risk prevention as well as the build-up of impact reduction and cleaning up capability compared with countries that have less resources and experience with these issues. This aspect has considerable relevance in the Baltic Sea region as there is a marked difference in resource availability and administrative experience between the former Soviet Union states on the one hand and the Nordic states and Germany on the other. This has had significant implications not only for national environmental management, transposition of EU regulations and implementation of international agreements but also in a wider, regional sense. It has been shown, especially during the first decade of independence in the 1990s, that the Nordic states influenced the Baltic States by giving targeted support to strengthen their administrative capability and assisting them in their preparation for becoming EU members (Hassler 2003a). It is clear in summary that perceiving environmental governance of marine transportation as globalised and therefore uniformly prone to collective action problems"

275,618,0.296,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"intractable epistemological uncertainty [13, 14, 50]. The black swan anecdote serves to illustrate Knightâs epistemic uncertainty outside an obviously economic or financial setting. Talebâs description of the behaviour of humans in concocting reasons for the event after the fact mirrors Keynesâ conventions describing economic agent behaviour, but does so in a manner that highlights the role in shaping expectations whether economic or otherwise - of a widely discredited position usually known as universal causality in philosophy. Talebâs observation that humans regard events as being much more attributable to determinable causes than they really are has a long history in philosophy as the notion of universal causation. Universal causation maintains that all events are the result of prior events, and this belief connects the construction of Talebâs post hoc explanations for rare events with Keynesâ view that economic agents maintain undue reliance on the veracity of prediction. The post- economic meltdown criticisms of financial firms assuming that the relevant risks are all measurable is a modern manifestation of the same effect. The intuitive appeal of this view lies in that whenever we ask simple questions after the fact about why a particular event occurred, we can obtain a plausible explanation for its occurrence in terms of some causal chain of earlier events. So it would seem on the face of it that every event is caused by something, albeit probabilistically, and hence that every event follows from prior events according to some governing logic. Yet the more deeply we dig, the more ostensibly antecedent sets of conditions look like reasons for deciding to act in a certain way, or, more pertinently, for not acting a certain way, and the less they look like the inevitable causes of an event that we first supposed. In other words, alleged causes are really only epistemic factors that influence the decisions we make from within a problem context, rather than immutable ontological features of an environment into which the agent peers from the outside. Universal causality connects to predictability through causal determinism, which holds that every event is necessitated by some set of prior events. This claim is then the antecedent to so-called âscientificâ determinism, which concludes therefore that the world is basically predictable. To elaborate: âscientificâ determinism alleges that the structure of the world is such that future events can be predicted with precision depending on that of knowledge of the governing laws of the phenomena of interest and the accuracy of the account of past events. It is worth noting that âscientificâ determinism is poorly named, for it is not actually about determinism at all: determinism refers to the absence of arbitrary choices in the application of transition operators, with non-determinism then being the admission of arbitrary choices. Rather, âscientificâ determinism is an assertion about predictability, equivalent to assuming stability and logical completeness. Though perhaps intuitively appealing, the inference from all events having necessary causes to predictability is flatly wrong: it is well established that even fully deterministic systems in which the current state completely determines the transition to a unique subsequent state can be nonetheless savagely unpredictable [20, 22]. Conversely, non-deterministic systems can also be completely predictable. Even if we limit ourselves to completely deterministic sys-"

It can be calculated risk as the product of hazard and vulnerability. Within the landslide risk management framework, vulnerability is regarded as potential for damage and loss caused by a hazard and would depend on a random mix of physical, social, economic, and environmental factors, which interact in space and time. 3. Development of a Policy Framework to promote and enrich the landslide risk awareness The landslide hazard map is another important entity in developing a policy framework to enrich landslide risk awareness. It is essential that the policy context be ï¬eld validated, reliability certiï¬ed and user-friendly. It should be effectively utilized, ensuring timely mitigation and expedited response. A special policy context should be outlined for the use of architects, planners, engineers and contractors to certify the safety of structures they plan, design and build. It will be useful to provide these hazard maps and policies to foreign visitors to educate them about the hazards they might face. If an area has been identiï¬ed as vulnerable to landslides and categorized under the landslide-prone areas, awareness programmes should be immediately conducted for the local community. This should be handled with utmost care, since the local community has been established in these areas making use of the local resources and involved in regional occupations. Thus it is important to build an amicable and lasting relationship with them. The state authorities and intervening organizations should consult these communities on proposing alternative job opportunities and highlighting the beneï¬t of resettling in a safer environment to minimize the impact in catastrophic situations. It is of vital importance to build a strong rapport with these citizens and thereby counteract or avoid misconceptions and negative attitudes towards the policies and action plans proposed by the government (Rupasinghe et al. 2014). 4. Development of a Policy Framework to promote a multi-disciplinary culture of landslide studies and management The major factor that governs promoting the multi-disciplinary culture of landslide studies is none other than the landslide professionals.

260,393,0.296,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"There are a number of ways to parameterize models and integrate them with data. Frequently, modelers choose parameter values by searching the literature, but often not all parameter values are available. Another method is to construct a model and fit the output to an existing data sequence. In the case of ranavirus modeling, predictions could be fit to surveillance data that include abundances of infected and uninfected individuals, or the magnitude and timing of a die-off. After the model is fit to the data, the parameter values that give the best fit or that match multiple patterns (as in POM) are then used. If some parameters are known and researchers have a good idea of the possible range of other parameters, these ranges of values can be explored to determine how they change the model output. Assessing the effects of changes in parameter values is called sensitivity analysis (Cariboni et al. 2007). If the model is especially sensitive to a certain parameter, it suggests that better parameter estimation would be a valuable research direction (Biek et al. 2002; Cariboni et al. 2007), especially if the parameter estimate is not based on robust data (e.g., low sample sizes). Cariboni et al. (2007) suggest best practices for sensitivity analysis. An excellent review of parameter estimation for disease modeling of natural populations can be found in Cooch et al. (2012). The aim of model evaluation is to determine if models typify natural systems well enough to represent the intended dynamics. This often involves determining whether or not they can be used to make accurate predictions. Frequently, the terms model evaluation, model validation, and model testing are used interchangeably. Because models are built on assumptions and simplifications, they are never truly âvalidâ or âcorrect.â Augusiak et al. (2014) have suggested the term âevaludationâ to represent the process of assessing the modelâs quality and reliability, and included six elements for proper âevaludationâ of a model: â Assessing the quality of the data used to build the model â Evaluating the simplifying assumptions structuring the model â Verifying that the model is correctly implemented"

Furthermore, policies have been artificially compartmentalized for protection of naturally interconnected systems of air, water, forests, agricultural lands and urban settlements via separate air, water and waste acts. More than 30 years after its initiation, industrial ecology has evolved to inform progressive sustainable policies in the developed world. These policies include embedding life-cycle thinking in the European Unionâs legislation and intelligent design of infrastructure (Chertow et al. 2015). Learning from these significant initiatives, developing countries need to progress towards this next generation of sustainable policymaking whose overarching vision should be to initiate, support and enforce sustainable conditions. IE provides an overarching framework for individual polices and schemes that support sustainable urban, industrial and rural development while ensuring weeding out, rather than locking in, of polluting technologies. Periodic monitoring of these policies will ensure that progress is not made in a fragmented and unsystematic fashion. For instance policies that focus on improving fuel efficiency of automobiles may be blind to the requirements of increasing the amount of land utilized for road transportation, the huge investment required for this infrastructure and the way it locks development into favouring road transport and ownership of automobiles. Such short-sighted policies may yield some benefits to the quality of life in the short term but harm it in the long run. Considering what has been achieved by industrial ecology in the developed world and learning from experience is important to avoid reinventing the wheel and losing out on one of our most precious resources â time. However, this is not the only direction for learning to take place; this chapter highlights the fact that developing countries not only offer valuable, relatively uncharted landscapes for enriching our understanding of how industrial ecology can inform sustainable development but also help uncover unexplored practices and technologies that can provide a similar level of social welfare by using far less resources."

However, we also can observe a continuous disciplinary differentiation and itemisation that is expressed, for example, in extended titles of academic chairs. From a social science perspective, scientific disciplines can be considered as institutions that shape the way in which people do research in a certain thematic field and on a range of topics (following CastaÌn Broto et al. 2009).

376,770,0.296,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","service conceptual framework (MA 2005). The most common approach to study ecosystem services has been related to the assessment of the capacity of ecosystems to deliver services, i.e., the supply of ecosystem services. Ecological production functions define how the spatial distribution of ecosystem structure and functioning determine the delivery of ecosystem services (Daily 1997). Even when ecosystem services have been defined as the outcome of ecosystem processes desired by people, the main focus of ecosystem service research has been to identify the potential of a region to produce ecosystem services independently of whether people are demanding them or not. In addition, the economic valuation of ecosystem services has also been a frequent target of research (Costanza et al. 1997; Gomez-Baggethun et al. 2010). In summary, the science of ecosystem services has developed rapidly in the past decades, but it has focused primarily on the supply of services and has largely overlooked the human demand for ecosystem services only until recently (Yahdjian et al. 2015). Human demand represents the other side of an ecosystem service equation of supply and demand, which is related to the social beneficiaries. Human consumption of resources and utilization of services that are supplied by ecosystems depend upon both their capacity to produce them and the societal value and need placed on those resources and services (Tallis and Polasky 2011). Demand for ecosystem services changes among stakeholders or social beneficiaries, who are the individuals or groups of individuals who have an interest in ecosystem services because they get a profit from them and could have an active or passive influence on their delivery (Lamarque et al. 2011). Stakeholders not only exhibit different demands, but they also have different valuations of various ecosystem services. Indeed, an ecosystem service is not a universally applicable physical phenomenon, but one whose value is shaped by its users. Sustainable land management depends on reconciling supply and demand for ecosystem services by different stakeholders. Rangelands are ideal for analyzing the balance between supply and demand for different types of services because of the variety of ecosystem services that they provide and the diverse suite of stakeholders interested in different services. In contrast, hyperarid ecosystems provide supporting, cultural, and regulating services but few provisioning services. Similarly humid ecosystems are generally transformed into crop- and wood-production systems, or are subject to human commercial, residential, and industrial development at the expense of cultural, provisioning, and regulating services. In addition, rangelands are broadly threatened by land degradation and climate change (Herrick et al. 2013). In general, rangelands produce abundant ecosystem services in quantity and variety, but the large value and threat of degradation contrast with the fact that humans usually assign small value to them, particularly when compared with tropical or temperate forests (Martin-Lopez et al. 2012). The transformation of rangeland ecosystems into croplands is constrained by biophysical conditions and economic feasibility (Havstad et al. 2007). For example, mesic rangelands have been converted to agriculture land, while arid and semiarid rangelands continue to be used as grazing lands, with investments in domestic animals, veterinary and reproductive management, fences, and water points that in combination result in a significant increase in livestock production (Oesterheld et al. 1992)."
143,680,0.296,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"is the risk of justifying a laissez-faire approach to policymaking instead of taking more adequate actionâthat is, a structural change in government that rewards and fosters innovation for society instead of trying to kill it because of institutionalized neophobia. Or, to put it more bluntly and use the words of our conversation with Erik Hersman: âSo the role of the government is very simple: To reduce friction in the system for the technology industry to grow.â Policymakers must ask, What are the distinct features and mechanisms that drive social movements in African societies? How can they be further nourished with the goal of fostering innovation output for society? And what are the successful policy approaches from the viewpoint of the society that can make government an enabler of, rather than an obstacle to, grassroots movement and innovation? Although physical location can be an inspiration, it can also be a source of frustration. During my own research in Kenyaâs technology sector, I came across an entrepreneur who said with great disillusionment in his voice, âWe are supposed to compete globally, yet we have to deal with the constraints we face here in Kenya!â Indeed, in a global knowledge economy, entrepreneurs are asked ideally to perfect their skills in both the local and the global game. This book is, in fact, dedicated to the dire need for rich context-specific knowledge that makes sense of and helps guide the entrepreneurial journey onto the global stage. Investors are pivotal companions. Stephen Gugu and Wilfred Mworiaâs chapter, in particular, filled an important gap. Although well-placed investments are crucial in helping strengthen and grow businesses, little is knownâbeyond industry reports driven by quantitative dataâabout the management structures prevalent in venture capital and private equity investment funds. Gugu and Mworiaâs insights revealed that, indeed, adaptations to the unique East African context have been a key challenge to making equity investment a standard financing vehicle. This opens up opportunities for new research to identify and test the many creative equity model changes currently at play in the investment space and to further develop new ones with the aim of finding the best-fitting models. Investment models that work are of great importance in triggering a stronger buy-in by domestic investors into domestic businesses.

180,28,0.296,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"There are many definitions of public health. They often begin as descriptions of current practice but once established become prescriptions for subsequent practice. It is important, then, to consider definitions, because they shape not only public health practice, but also how we conceive of public health ethics (Dawson and Verweij 2007). The same logic applies to how we think about the individual concepts of health and the public. Defining health as the absence of disease or symptoms, for example, more readily fits allopathic medicine, which focuses on negating symptoms to treat disease. But it hardly fits public healthâs emphasis on preventive measures that address root causes rather than symptoms. Nor does it cover public healthâs promotion of health and well-being across a range of interventions. In this regard, the World Health Organization (WHO) offers a definition of health more suitable to public health: âA state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmityâ (WHO 2006). But even this more holistic definition does not sufficiently clarify the meaning of âpublicâ in public health. Dawson and Verweij (2007) identify two primary meanings of âpublicâ in public health, each of which they break down into three senses. Public can mean population-wide and refer to (1) the epidemiologically measured health of a population or group, (2) the distribution of health in a population, or (3) the underlying social and environmental conditions impacting everyoneâs health. Public also can mean collectively accomplished and requiring (1) the concerted actions of many people and institutions whether governmental or nongovernmental; (2) the cooperation or involvement of the public, or (3) the publicâs joint participation to realize the health improvement. In a practical field like public health, definition often takes the form of enumerating key activities, such as surveillance, sanitation, maintaining food and workplace safety, disease prevention and control, and promoting healthy behavior. The identification of the ten essential services of public health illustrates this enumerative approach (Fig. 1.1) (Public Health Functions Steering Committee 1994). These services fall under three overarching functions of assessment, policy development, and assurance that constitute an integrated cyclic process. The delivery of these services in local, regional, or national public health agencies accordingly defines public health practice. In this schema, research is a distinct practical service but also integral to all public health activities, providing insights and innovative solutions at every point. Public health ethics addresses the entire spectrum of ethical issues that arise in any area of public health practice but especially in those areas where no specific guidelines govern practice. Such lists have the advantage of concretely specifying current activities but lack criteria that definitions normally provide for including or excluding additional activities as a field develops. In 1920, Charles Edward A. Winslow, an influential public health theorist and leader, pioneered a definition of public health that still informs many European and international public health institutions, including WHO (Marks et al. 2011)."
248,77,0.296,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","Water Availability Is not an Ecological Issue, but a Management Problem Solved at High Social and Ecological Costs That water availability is not dependent on ecological conditions is particularly obvious in regions such as Africa, Central Asia, the USA, as well as in China. Neighboring countries with similar ecological conditions in North- as well as in West Africa have very different access rates to safe water sources. In the Democratic Republic of Congo only three quarter of the population is provided with safe drinking water, despite holding nearly a quarter of all renewable water resources and represents the water richest country of the entire continent. In contrast, in very dry countries like Egypt or Namibia, nearly 100 % of the population has access to safe drinking water (MDG 2015). The problems of water supply are obviously not of an ecological nature but are the outcome of the political economy speciï¬c to these countries. The importance of the political economy to understand water availability is also evident in the American West, where the water supply for drinking water, irrigation, and the industry of not only California, but also of the western states like Nevada, Arizona, and Utah has been developed in a particular socio-economic and political context presented in famous books like âRivers of Empireâ by D. Worster (1985) and âCadillac Desertâ by M. Reisner (1986). Other famous examples of how limited hydrological conditions are overcome on a large scale in order to enable urban, agricultural, and industrial development can be seen in the control and exploitation of the Amou-Daria and the Syr-Daria in Central Asia or the Yangtse in China. Rivers here have been tamed, controlled, and managed in order to exploit them in the service of the economy, the people and the state. But the control and the exploitation, (i.e. the management patterns of these rivers) have created social and economic inequalities, sometimes even dramatic ecological consequences. Of major concern is the removal of people and the loss of properties due to the construction of dams. According to the World Commission on Dams, between 40 and 80 million people have been displaced worldwide since the 1940s often without recovering their livelihoods (World Commission on Dams 2000). The displacement of people, as well as the consequences downstream leads to an increase of social and economic disparities. Very few people (mostly the national elites) actually beneï¬t from these dams and the economic wealth created by it, while the majority of people loose their livelihoods, triggering oppositions and sometime virulent resistance. Another issue created by the construction of dams is the unequal water share riparian states can use, despite treaties, and agreements. Successive treaties over the use of Nile water between Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan"
269,154,0.296,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"The familiar register of exhortations to interdisciplinarity â mutuality! reciprocity! exchange! â is one that assumes that differentials of power do not exist. And yet, for many people from the humanities and social sciences â and we are thinking quite beyond our own collaborations here â experiencing oneâs role in a collaboration with life scientists as a relatively powerless one undercuts these kinds of exhortations. Go to the bar at any science and technology studies conference, and it wonât take too many drinks before social scientists start telling you about how their research is often understood as âpublic engagementâ; how they consistently have to justify their expertise to their collaborators; how they have to translate (or sometimes give up on) their conceptual language in a way that is not always reciprocated, and so on. This doesnât mean that life scientists in collaborations are especially power-hungry; or that they behave badly (no doubt most would be surprised and taken aback to learn that their collaborators would narrate their experience in such ways). But it is to say that when a group of people collaborate within institutional structures that end up placing the more highly valued epistemological frameworks, as well as financial resources, largely on one side, then asymmetries result. Even among â and perhaps especially among â the most well-meaning people, such asymmetries can produce some unlovely relations. It is important to note that such relations are rarely, if ever, explicitly endorsed by collaborating life scientists, and life scientists themselves often do not gain from them. Indeed, to the extent that interdisciplinary asymmetries of power can produce silences and absences, there is a significant risk that they reduce the space for the complex collaborative entanglements that motivate many scientific collaborators in the first place. Perhaps more importantly, and this is perhaps not always so visible to collaborators, even if natural scientists in particular collaborations may appear to hold all the power, those scientists themselves are subject to precisely the same asymmetries, when they reenter a larger prestige economy that might mark their collaborations with social scientists or humanities scholars as decidedly low-value contributions. And this is to say nothing of the way that natural scientists may experience a more subtle asymmetry, as they get pinioned by the philosopherâs or literary theoristâs rhetorical monopoly on, and their own explicit exclusion from, what it means to think âcriticallyâ. (Indeed, we have lost track of the number of times we"
376,275,0.296,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Abstract Rangeland management, like most disciplines of natural resource management, has been characterized by human efforts to reduce variability and increase predictability in natural systems (steady-state management often applied through a command-and-control paradigm). Examples of applications of traditional command and control in natural resource management include wildfire suppression, fences to control large ungulate movements, predator elimination programs, and watershed engineering for flood control and irrigation. Recently, a robust theoretical foundation has been developed that focuses on our understanding of the importance of variability in nature. This understanding is built upon the concept of heterogeneity, which originated from influential calls to consider spatial and temporal scaling in ecological research. Understanding rangeland ecosystems from a resilience perspective where we recognize that these systems are highly variable in space and time cannot be achieved without a focus on heterogeneity across multiple scales."
255,8,0.296,Railway Ecology,"Organization We have divided the book into two parts. The ï¬rst aims at reviewing the main ideas and methods related to the identiï¬cation, monitoring, and mitigation of railway impacts on biodiversity, with emphasis on wildlife mortality, barrier effects, biological invasions, and the effects of other railway environmental impacts such as noise and chemical pollution. We begin by setting the scene (Chap. 1âRailway Ecology), framing railways in their economic context, and providing several examples of how railways can impact biodiversity. In Chap. 2 (Wildlife Mortality on Railways), Sara Santos and her colleagues provide a comprehensive review of mortality rates on railways, paying particular attention to the sources of bias when estimating mortality rates. In Chap. 3 (Methods for Monitoring and Mitigating Wildlife Mortality on Railways), Filipe Carvalho and his colleagues have further developed the theme of wildlife mortality, focusing on monitoring and mitigation. They discuss the application to railways of mitigation procedures routinely used in road ecology, and provide an overview of wildlife crossing structures and their role in reducing mortality and barrier effects. In Chap. 4 (Railways as Barriers for Wildlife: Current Knowledge and Future Steps), Rafael Barrientos and LuÃ­s Borda-de-Ãgua examine the barrier effects of railways, reviewing the evidence and providing an overview on procedures used to quantify barrier effects, with emphasis on genetic methods and individual-based computer simulations. They then discuss mitigation measures and their effectiveness, providing guidelines for monitoring and mitigation. In Chap. 5 (Aliens on the Move: Transportation Networks and Non-native Species), Fernando AscensÃ£o and CÃ©sar Capinha examine the role of railways in the spread of invasive species, showing that land transportation systems have greatly contributed to species introductions with high economic and environmental costs. They discuss measures to decrease the risk of alien species introductions, paying special attention to verges and associated vegetation corridors. In Chap. 6 (Railway Disturbances: Types, Effects on Wildlife and Mitigation Measures), Silva Lucas and her colleagues look at biodiversity impacts caused by railways due to noise, air, soil and water pollution, as well as soil erosion. They conclude that impacts are species-speciï¬c, depending largely on species traits, and that impacts can be minimized through improvements in the railway structure and the implementation of mitigation measures. The second part of the book provides a set of case studies from around the world that illustrate the impacts of railways on wildlife and ways to reduce those impacts. Reflecting the strong interest in the topic of wildlife mortality, four chapters focus on the patterns of mortality resulting from collisions with trains and railway structures, each of which suggests several mitigation measures to reduce such mortality. In Chap. 7 (Bird Collisions in a Railway Crossing a Wetland of International Importance â Sado Estuary, Portugal), Carlos Godinho and colleagues examine the risk of aquatic bird mortality due to railway bridge crossing wetland habitats, by combining data from surveys on carcasses and the observation of bird movements. They have found that this bridge had a low risk for aquatic birds, as"
118,735,0.296,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"What the author discussed in the previous sections can be interpreted as a case of this phenomenon. Historically speaking, Science and Technology Studies (STS), Sociology of Science and Technology and History of Science and Technology have critically examined such mechanism motivated by the improvement of political legitimacy and the democratization of science and technology. In other word, they have problematized this issue for the sake of the other members of society, not for engineers. However, the author would like to argue that this situation is critically problematic not only for the rest of society, but also for engineers themselves at the same time, when we think about the future of (nuclear) engineering in society. Achievement of engineering is not limited to improvement of technology. Innovation of technology should also be, or sometimes more, important and exciting for engineers. Of course, improvement also requires substantial innovation in many cases. But, what is really admired by their colleagues and âclientsâ is the epoch-making breakthrough that provides brand-new options for society. This kind of innovation is sometimes not a direct evolution of preceding technology and its appraisal. Christensen sheds new light on mechanism of innovation by examining many cases of âdisruptive innovationsâ in his famous book The Innovatorâs Dilemma [12]. He emphasizes the importance to be free from stereotypical, conservative mindsets that prevent such breakthrough. It should be noted that experts tend to be possessed by conventional appraisal standard of technical merits.

An independent UK body, the Adaptation Subcommittee, assesses the preparedness to meet the risks and opportunities of climate change. In this context adaptation is required to include protecting and restoring marine habitats to increase their resilience to climate change. More than 25 % of English waters is designated as Marine Protected Areas and managed as a network of habitats to aid the movement of species affected by climate change and to decrease threats such as overï¬shing. The National Heritage Protection Plan sets out how Englandâs landscapes, archaeological sites and historic buildings will be protected from the impacts of climate change. This includes actions such as the continuation of âRapid Coastal Zone Assessment Surveysâ that record and assess the risk to heritage assets on the coast (DEFRA 2013)."
