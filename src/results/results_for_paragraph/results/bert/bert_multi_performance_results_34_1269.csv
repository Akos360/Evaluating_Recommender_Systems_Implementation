255,39,0.527,Railway Ecology,"Abstract Wildlife mortality on roads has received considerable attention in the past years, allowing the collection of abundant data for a wide range of taxonomic groups. On the contrary, studies of wildlife mortality on railway tracks are scarce and have focused primarily on a few large mammals, such as moose and bears. Nevertheless, many species are found as victims of collisions with trains, although certain taxonomic groups, such as amphibians and reptiles, and/or small bodied species are reported infrequently and their mortality is probably underestimated. However, no assessment of population impacts is known for railways. Keywords Wildlife mortality"

376,664,0.522,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The impacts of pathogens and parasites were historically ignored by wildlife ecologists who mostly considered disease as a compensatory form of mortality. That was probably because, with the exception of acute disease outbreaks, infectious diseases were not easily observed and those disease outbreaks that did result in large-scale die-offs were perceived as random one-time events. Only by knowing the disease status of individuals, and following them through time, do some of the underlying processes become apparent. Due to these observational challenges the importance of disease to the functioning of ecosystems was undervalued."
255,240,0.519,Railway Ecology,"Introduction Like roads, railroads affect wildlife through direct mortality, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation (van der Grift 1999; Forman et al. 2003; Davenport and Davenport 2006). Direct mortalities result when trains strike wildlife. Strikes can be a signiï¬cant source of mortality for some wildlife populations and have been reported for decades (Child 1983; Gundersen et al. 1998; Bertch and Gibeau 2010a). Studies have reported strike rates for large mammals such as grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) (Bertch and Gibeau 2010a, b) and moose (Alces alces) (Child 1983, 1991; Modafferi 1991). In Canadaâs Rocky Mountain National Parks, train strikes are a leading source of mortality for grizzly bears (0.35 yearâ1) and black bears (1.95 yearâ1), and the second largest source of mortality for deer (Odocoileus spp.), elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Bertch and Gibeau 2010a, b) in the Banff and Yoho National Parks. It is likely that true mortality rates due to train strikes are higher than reported. For example, as few as 50% of strikes with large mammals were reported by standard observers (train engineers) along the Canadian Paciï¬c Railroad (CPR) during a six-year period (Wells et al. 1999). In other cases, strikes may not be reported except when large groups (>450) of wildlife are killed (Chaney 2011) or when strikes occur within protected areas (Waller and Servheen 2005). Long-term data of train strikes along the CPR exist because strikes have been reported to Parks Canada for at least 30 years. However, other railroads may not report or record strikes with such consistency. Studies on roads have analyzed the spatial pattern of road-kills, which showed that these occurred in clusters (Finder et al. 1999; Clevenger et al. 2003; Malo et al. 2004). The spatial pattern of road-kills has been explained by landscape, environmental and infrastructure variables (Finder et al. 1999; Hubbard and Danielson 2000; Gunson et al. 2006; Kassar 2005). These studies have helped inform management actions targeted at reducing road-kills (Clevenger et al. 2001; Grilo et al. 2009). At least ï¬ve general factors are thought to affect the spatial pattern of road-kills and train strikes (Seiler and Helldin 2006). Along railroads, these include: animal (e.g., wildlife abundance and behavior); train (e.g., train speed and frequency); railroad design (e.g., curvature or alignment); and landscape (e.g., vegetation type) variables (Huber et al. 1998; Bashore et al. 1985; Finder et al. 1999; Seiler and Helldin 2006). Driver behavior variables are largely removed from train strike analyses because trains generally cannot stop or swerve to avoid animals. Landscape variables derived from land cover data have been found to be the best predictors of road-kill rates (Bashore et al. 1985; Finder et al. 1999; Roger and Ramp 2009). We suggest that estimates of relative abundance be used to assess the spatial pattern of road-kills and train strikes. The importance of including wildlife abundance in the analysis of factors contributing to wildlife strikes was demonstrated for moose: strikes coincided with locations of high moose abundance in wintering areas and on migration routes (Gundersen et al. 1998; Ito et al. 2008). Train variables and railroad design, as well as animal abundance, vary along the CPR and may also affect strike rates. If train or railroad variables altered the probability of a strike, the rate of"
255,42,0.519,Railway Ecology,"Mammal Mortality Mortality of mammals due to train collisions can be of considerable importance. In multispecies surveys (Heske 2015; SCV 1996; van der Grift 1999) of all vertebrate recorded, the approximate proportion of mammals found dead on rail tracks ranges from 26% (Netherlands), to 36% (USA) and 38% (Spain). Train mortality can have large impacts on mammal populations, particularly for species that are already endangered, species with large home ranges and low density populations, and species with low reproductive rate (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998; van der Grift 1999). The highest mortality numbers are usually found at sections where rail lines intersect important mammal habitats or migration routes (Child 1983; Gundersen and Andreassen 1998; van der Grift 1999). Many species are victims of collisions. The body size of the mammal species that are killed varies greatly, ranging from small insectivores (as the hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus) and small carnivores (such as the Virginia opossum Didelphis virginiana), to large carnivores (such as the grizzly and brown bear Ursus arctos and the American lynx Lynx canadensis), to ungulates (such as moose Alces alces and deer Cervus elaphus), and even elephants (Elephas maximus) (Child 1983; Gibeau and Herrero 1998; Gibeau and Heuer 1996; Gundersen et al. 1998; Gundersen and Andreassen 1998; Heske 2015; Krofel et al. 2012; Rausch 1958; Singh et al. 2001; van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998). Still, most existing studies focus on large ungulates and carnivores, and most lack quantitative data (van der Grift 1999)."
255,76,0.512,Railway Ecology,"Sources of Bias in Wildlife Mortality Estimates The reduction of mortality is one of the main aims of mitigation measures, hence high mortality rates and their locations need to be as accurate as possible (Guinard et al. 2012). As stated, even in systematic surveys, the number of carcasses found largely underestimates mortality because (1) only a subset of animals killed stay within the area that is searched by the observer; (2) many carcasses are removed by scavengers, or decomposed until the survey occurs; and (3) some dead animals remain undetected because of the observers failure (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). Thus, to obtain unbiased estimates, the numbers obtained during surveys should be corrected by taking into account: (1) the proportion of animals killed in the area searched; (2) carcass persistence probability; and (3) searcher efï¬ciency. In order to take into account these sources of bias, several mortality estimators were developed in wind farm studies (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015) and some have been applied to road casualties (Gerow et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2013), but rarely to railways, where these issues also apply. The proportion of casualties (dead and/or injured that have not moved away) recorded at the search area can be obtained from the size and spatial distribution of the total area that can be searched, the spatial distribution of the carcasses, and the proportion of injured animals (still alive) that manage to move away. However, the"

246,136,0.479,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The Pervasive Impact of Humans Despite the existence of many large protected areas where human impacts are minimised, just about all predator-prey systems on earth are impacted by humans in various ways. The most obvious and immediate effect is through human induced mortality of both predators and prey. While some of the planetâs largest protected areas may insulate some large herbivores from human exploitation, there is still pervasive human impact through poaching and legal harvest within protected areas or on the herbivores that seasonally migrate outside the borders. For large carnivores, the situation is even worse as their wide-ranging movements more often carry them beyond protected area borders (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998). In a European context, where protected areas are often small, there are probably very few large predator individuals, let alone populations, that live their lives entirely inside protected areas (Linnell et al. 2001). In addition to the deliberate targeting of these species, there are many other sources of mortality which humans induce, such as through vehicle collisions (Langbein et al. 2011) and cases where disease is transferred from domestic to wild species. Furthermore, humans have very strong impacts on herbivores through their manipulation of habitats (see Chap. 8). Forestry and agricultural practices have dramatic impacts on vegetation structure and productivity that can have both positive and negative impacts on herbivore and carnivore populations (e.g. Gill et al. 1996; Torres et al. 2011). In general, small scale forestry and agriculture lead to situations that increase productivity and benefit many herbivores. The winter feeding of wild herbivores is a widespread activity across most of northern, eastern and central Europe which has the potential to greatly influence herbivore distribution and density (Putman et al. 2011). Long-term deposition of nitrogen and climate change can also have dramatic impacts on the productivity of vegetation (Holland et al. 2005). Another impact comes from competition between domestic and wild species. Domestic herbivore densities tend to exceed those of wild herbivores and can have dramatic impacts on habitat structure and the productivity of vegetation, as well as providing potential prey items for predators. In many areas, animals of domestic origin have been, and still are, critical prey for large carnivores (Mattisson et al. 2011; Peterson and Ciucci 2003). Even predators of domestic origin (domestic cats and dogs) can compete with wild predators. A final impact occurs through the behavioural disturbance that human presence and activity can induce in both predators and prey (Moen et al. 2012). Given the mobility of both large carnivores and large"
291,68,0.478,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The current chapter shows how surface maps of rates of mortality improvement can also be used to analyze causes of death. This might enable researchers to gain better insights into the underlying mortality dynamics than merely looking at the Lexis surface of rates of improvement for all-cause mortality. We selected the United States for two reasons: â¢ Data on deaths are available as public use files since 1959 (National Center for Health Statistics 1959â2015; National Bureau of Economic Research 1959â 2015). Information is included not only on age at death and sex of each deceased individual but also on cause of death and many other variables. See Chap. 3, starting on page 11, for further details about the more than 118 mio. deaths contained in the data. â¢ The pattern of the rates of mortality improvement for women in the United States looked different than in any of the other countries (see Fig. 6.21 on page 65). Since the late 1970s/early 1980s, the US has not experienced any prolonged period of survival improvements. Indeed, the United States gained less years of life than most other western countries during the latter part of the twentieth century. As a consequence the National Institute on Aging in the United States ârequested that the National Research Council (NRC) launch a major investigation to clarify patterns in the levels and trends in international differences in life expectancy above age 50â (Crimmins et al. 2011, p. 2). We used again the same techniques and color schemes as in Chap. 6. To avoid any spurious conclusions due to small numbers of deaths, we excluded deaths above age 95 and below age 20."

Bears were struck on average 2.86 Â± 0.44 per segment, but no segment was identiï¬ed as a hotspot because no single segment incurred more than seven strikes. After estimating the ratio of strikes to wildlife abundance for each segment, overall non-constant risk was apparent for elk (v2 = 286.1, df = 27; p < 0.0001), deer (v2 = 182.0, df = 27; p < 0.0001), and bears (v2 = 7.4  106, df = 27; p < 0.0001). High-risk segments were identiï¬ed for each species (Figs. 9.1 and 9.3).

Individual cases of humans or cattle lives lost were well known among villagers,âunderscoring these events as âspecialâ or ânewsâ to villagers. When told of the GOEâs estimates of lost people and livestock, all informants were either angry or scoffed at such accounts. The 2006 flood waters were not even strong enough at the mouth of the Omo River to cause many ï¬shers to cease ï¬shing or suffer damage to their nets and other equipment during the approximately ten day high flood waters. Villagers near the riverâs terminus at the lakeâfor example, at Lopeleleâdescribe continued active ï¬shing by both Turkana and Dasanech at the time. They also described the Ethio-Fisheries Corporation as remaining in the main channel for ï¬shing during the flood. In other words, all three groups of ï¬shers continued their activity throughout the floodâs duration, while agriculturalists and pastoralists moved laterally from the river to await its return to a lower level. â¢ Crops were submerged, but this was universally described as an exception from the predominant experience over many years of Omo flooding, with success in recession agriculture when they were fortunate enough to receive âenoughâ water."

Baerwald and Barclay (2011) reported that speciesâspecific fatalities were affected by greater moon illumination. They also observed that falling barometric pressure and the number of deaths were correlated and that whereas fatalities of silver-haired bats increased with increased activity of this species, moon illumination, and south-easterly winds, hoary bat mortality increased most significantly with falling barometric pressure. Interestingly, neither hoary bat activity nor fatality was influenced by any measured variables other than falling barometric pressure (Baerwald and Barclay 2011). Again, this could result from decreasing barometric pressure that triggers insect flight activity and therefore may motivate foraging efforts among bats by indicating a potential increase in food availability (Wellington 2011)."

Improvements to reticulated water supplies have not been quite adequate to compensate for this, and consequently levels of water-borne diseases have risen slightly. Protection of biodiversity has been detrimentally affected by a government focus on economic development, though efforts by civil society groups to remedy this have been stepped up. Coastal fisheries have dwindled due to the use of illegal and destructive gear, defiance of the ban period by the fishers and catching of undersized fish.

255,3,0.443,Railway Ecology,"Eureka! The ï¬rst book on railway ecology has arrived. This pioneering edited volume, written by an international cast, brings together and synthesizes todayâs âstate-of-the-science and application.â Building on the diverse European railway network, the approach is global, with work also from North America, South America, and Asia. The ecological effects of railways are central, while the mitigation of effects appears throughout the book. Rich scientiï¬c highlights are compelling: wildlife mortality patterns; effects on biodiversity; the barrier effect; lots on ungulates, bears, bats, songbirds, and waterbirds. But there is also information on plants, elephants, amphibians, kites, gazelles, and many more, e.g., detecting mortality âhotspots,â and rail-side (verge) habitats, as well as case studies worldwide. Mitigations to minimize impacts emerge as a motif: wildlife crossing approaches; noise reduction; reducing outward noise propagation; alerting wildlife >2 seconds before an expected animal-train collision; reducing avian collisions and electrocution by the elevated net of wires; restricting access; and decreasing vibrations are also discussed in detail. Many nations are actively adding track, while high-speed trains are spreadingâ¦ for good reason. Rail transport is more efï¬cient than road trafï¬c at moving people and goods, and there is more fuel efï¬ciency; less greenhouse gas emission; less unhealthful air pollution; less trafï¬c congestion; and less land consumed. Most importantly, it is also safer. Furthermore, people personally depend on, and are affected by, trains. Trains take commuters to work daily. Every day we depend on long freight trains successfully carrying coal and oil. Many of us ride trains to other cities. Small towns often wither without trains stopping at their stations. Industry and jobs depend on trains bringing heavy resources, such as grain, coal, and minerals. We also buy heavy products, including autos, brought by train from factories. Train noise and their vibrations degrade our neighborhoods near the tracks. Infrequent chemical spills pollute water bodies and neighborhoods. Children wave at the engineer, and gleefully count the wagons/cars of long freight trains. Railway ecology really differs from road ecology. Thus much wildlife moves along rail corridors. At any location, noise from the trains is usually infrequent, loud,"
260,274,0.44,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ranaviruses were detected and diagnosed as a disease agent in amphibians in the 1960s, and in reptiles and fish in the 1980s (Duffus et al. 2015). Since these initial cases, ranaviruses have been linked to numerous epizootic mortality events in these three classes of lower vertebrate animals (Duffus et al. 2015). Although long-term population data are generally lacking, there is evidence that ranaviruses can cause population declines in amphibians (Teacher et al. 2010; Beebee 2012; Earl and Gray 2014; Price et al. 2014). Further, the nearly complete loss of entire age classes of fish and amphibians due to ranavirus outbreaks have been reported (Petranka et al. 2003; Todd-Thompson 2010; Waltzek et al. 2014; Wheelwright et al. 2014), and some species of global conservation concern are highly susceptible (Geng et al. 2010; Sutton et al. 2014a).

On average, humanity has constructed one 45 m high dam every day for the past 140 years (Bai et al. 2015). The pace and scale of dam construction and other forms of river modiï¬cation are reï¬ected in the scale of impacts on aquatic ï¬ora and fauna. The greatest acceleration of biodiversity loss due to human activities in human history has occurred since 1970 (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The drivers causing loss of biodiversity and, hence, of ecosystem services are either steady, show no evidence of declining over time, or are increasing in intensity. By aggregating the trends of some 3000 wild species, the Living Planet Index has documented a 40% decline in average species abundance between 1970 and 2000. The more rapid decline (50%) of inland water species underscores their greater vulnerability, being closer to the workings and by-products of human enterprise, while both marine and terrestrial species declined by about 30%. The concomitant loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services has been driven by both steady and episodic changes to habitat (land use change and geo-engineering), climate, overexploitation of resources (water, soil, biomass), and pollution. Geo-engineering of rivers has systematically channelized rivers for transport and to increase drainage during high-water events and separated the channel from the ï¬oodplain to protect water-sensitive row crops and zones for high-density habitation, commerce, and industry and dammed rivers for hydropower (Zarï¬ et al. 2014) as well as for water storage as a hedge against drought. Damming rivers currently stores the equivalent of 15% of global annual river runoff (Likens 2010). As a result 48% of rivers (expressed as river volume) globally is moderately-toseverely impacted by either ï¬ow regulation, fragmentation, or both. Impacts could double should all planned dams be constructed by 2030 (Grill et al. 2015)."

In addition, a status review of M. lucifugus is being conducted to determine whether listing as federally endangered is warranted of this once common species (Frick et al. 2010). In Canada, three species, M. lucifugus, M. septentrionalis and P. subflavus were listed as endangered in 2015. The rapid spread and extensive mortality associated with WNS raise serious concerns about population viability for species that are being impacted by this disease. In this chapter, we review what is currently known about WNS, focusing on mechanisms of disease, disease ecology, global distribution patterns and conservation and management. We first explain why WNS belongs in a volume addressing bats in the Anthropocene. We review what is known about disease mechanisms, including what we currently understand about the physiology of the disease and immune response in bats. We then review what is currently known about disease ecology of WNS, including the population impacts to species, and then highlight"
255,46,0.435,Railway Ecology,"Train Accidents with Bears Bears are often the most frequently reported carnivore killed by trains in Central Europe and North America. In Montana, USA, 29 grizzly bears were killed on 109 km section of a railway track between 1980 and 2002 (Waller and Servheen 2005), while nine brown bears were killed on the LjubljanaâTrieste railway, Slovenia, between 1992 and 1999 (Kaczensky et al. 2003). Train accidents with bears were also reported in the Abruzzo mountains, Italy (Boscagli 1987), and in Croatia, where 70% of all trafï¬c killed bears occurred along the ZagrebâRijeka railway (Huber et al. 1998). In Mount Robson Provincial Park, Canada, the black bear (U. americanus) was the carnivore with the highest mortality caused by trains, with a higher number of collisions in railways than on the highways (Huijser et al. 2012). In British Columbia, Canada, 13 black bears were killed on a 15 km railway section between 1994 and 1996 (Munro 1997; Wells et al. 1999). Why are so many bears killed by trains? Historically, grizzly bears have been attracted to railways by grain leaked from trains along the tracks or that accumulated at sites of repeated derailments. Such concentration of food led grizzly bears being struck and killed by trains at these sites (Waller and Servheen 2005). However, grain spills have been reduced through the years and recent research suggests that most bears struck by trains are young individuals, which are unlikely to have acquired the behaviour of feeding on spilled grains (Kaczensky et al. 2003; Krofel et al. 2012). Some collisions happened because bears had used the railway as"

Marques, Pedro Salgueiro, LuÃ­sa Catarino, CÃ¢ndida OsÃ³rio de Castro, AntÃ³nio Mira and Pedro Beja Abstract Many studies have evaluated bird mortality in relation to roads and other human structures, but little is known about the potential impacts of railways. In particular, it is uncertain whether railways are an important mortality source when crossing wetlands heavily used by aquatic birds. Here we analyze bird collisions in a railway that crosses the Nature Reserve of the Sado Estuary (Portugal) over an annual cycle, documenting bird mortality and the flight behaviour of aquatic birds in relation to a bowstring bridge. During monthly surveys conducted on 16.3 km of railway, we found 5.8 dead birds/km/10 survey days in the section crossing wetland habitats (6.3 km), while <0.5 dead birds/km/10 survey days were found in two sections crossing only forested habitats. Most birds recorded were small songbirds (Passeriformes), while there was only a small number of aquatic birds (common moorhen, mallard, flamingo, great cormorant, gulls) and other non-passerines associated with wetlands (white stork).

255,8,0.431,Railway Ecology,"Organization We have divided the book into two parts. The ï¬rst aims at reviewing the main ideas and methods related to the identiï¬cation, monitoring, and mitigation of railway impacts on biodiversity, with emphasis on wildlife mortality, barrier effects, biological invasions, and the effects of other railway environmental impacts such as noise and chemical pollution. We begin by setting the scene (Chap. 1âRailway Ecology), framing railways in their economic context, and providing several examples of how railways can impact biodiversity. In Chap. 2 (Wildlife Mortality on Railways), Sara Santos and her colleagues provide a comprehensive review of mortality rates on railways, paying particular attention to the sources of bias when estimating mortality rates. In Chap. 3 (Methods for Monitoring and Mitigating Wildlife Mortality on Railways), Filipe Carvalho and his colleagues have further developed the theme of wildlife mortality, focusing on monitoring and mitigation. They discuss the application to railways of mitigation procedures routinely used in road ecology, and provide an overview of wildlife crossing structures and their role in reducing mortality and barrier effects. In Chap. 4 (Railways as Barriers for Wildlife: Current Knowledge and Future Steps), Rafael Barrientos and LuÃ­s Borda-de-Ãgua examine the barrier effects of railways, reviewing the evidence and providing an overview on procedures used to quantify barrier effects, with emphasis on genetic methods and individual-based computer simulations. They then discuss mitigation measures and their effectiveness, providing guidelines for monitoring and mitigation. In Chap. 5 (Aliens on the Move: Transportation Networks and Non-native Species), Fernando AscensÃ£o and CÃ©sar Capinha examine the role of railways in the spread of invasive species, showing that land transportation systems have greatly contributed to species introductions with high economic and environmental costs. They discuss measures to decrease the risk of alien species introductions, paying special attention to verges and associated vegetation corridors. In Chap. 6 (Railway Disturbances: Types, Effects on Wildlife and Mitigation Measures), Silva Lucas and her colleagues look at biodiversity impacts caused by railways due to noise, air, soil and water pollution, as well as soil erosion. They conclude that impacts are species-speciï¬c, depending largely on species traits, and that impacts can be minimized through improvements in the railway structure and the implementation of mitigation measures. The second part of the book provides a set of case studies from around the world that illustrate the impacts of railways on wildlife and ways to reduce those impacts. Reflecting the strong interest in the topic of wildlife mortality, four chapters focus on the patterns of mortality resulting from collisions with trains and railway structures, each of which suggests several mitigation measures to reduce such mortality. In Chap. 7 (Bird Collisions in a Railway Crossing a Wetland of International Importance â Sado Estuary, Portugal), Carlos Godinho and colleagues examine the risk of aquatic bird mortality due to railway bridge crossing wetland habitats, by combining data from surveys on carcasses and the observation of bird movements. They have found that this bridge had a low risk for aquatic birds, as"

For example, white-nosed syndrome causes devastating declines in bat populations in the USA and Canada (e.g., Frick et al. 2010), and national programs for improving insulation of buildings, particularly in Northern Europe, cause losses of roosting opportunities for bats such as the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus; Voigt et al. 2016).

255,238,0.428,Railway Ecology,"Abstract Train-wildlife collisions can impact wildlife populations as well as create human and resource management challenges along railways. We identiï¬ed locations and railroad design features associated with train-wildlife collisions (strikes) on a 134 km section of the Canadian Paciï¬c Railroad (CPR) that travels through the Banff and Yoho National Parks. A 21-year dataset of train strikes with elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus spp.), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bears (U. arctos) were compared to relative abundance estimates, and nine train and railroad variables. Train strikes and relative abundance varied spatially for elk, deer and bears. Hotspots and relative risk estimates were used to identify potential problem locations. Hotspots were deï¬ned as segments of the train line where strike counts were above the 95% conï¬dence interval based on a Poisson distribution, and could be identiï¬ed for elk and deer but not bears. Relative risk was estimated as the ratio of strike counts to that expected based on relative abundance. High relative risk locations, where more strikes occurred than were expected, were identiï¬ed for elk, deer, and bears. Relative abundance was positively correlated with strikes for elk and deer but not bears. Train speed limit was positively associated with strikes for elk and deer. For bears, the number of structures (e.g., overpasses, tunnels, snow sheds and rock cuts) and bridges were positively correlated to strikes. To reduce the risk of train strikes on wildlife, our management recommendations include train speed reduction, habitat modiï¬cations and railroad design alterations.

From these results arise new questions for future research about how extensively rewilding should be facilitated, especially in those low-altitude humanized areas, in order to decrease vulture dependence on networks of large and fixed supplementary feeding stations. The consumption of wild ungulate carcasses derived from hunting is not exempt of risk for avian scavengers. Birds ingesting pieces of hunting ammunition are exposed to lead intoxication (see review in Fisher et al. 2006; Mateo et al. 2007) to the extent that its incidence can be a serious threat to large-scale reintroduction projects such as that of the California condor in North America (Finkenlstein et al. (2012 and references therein). Lead levels are also very high in Europe, for instance Iberian griffon vultures show seasonal and spatial variations according to the rate of consumption of wild ungulates (GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez et al. 2005). Moreover, carcasses resulting from hunting activities frequently accumulate at a few points at the end of hunting activities (Wilmers et al. 2003), which mimics the predictability offered by vulture restaurants and may result in similar negative effects (see above). Under a future scenario of a wilder Europe, we may promote two lines of action to curb the poisoning of scavengers: the consideration of a wilder Europe with zones limiting or lacking in hunting activities and in parallel the encouragement of the traditional extensive grazing currently under decline."

Over the last few decades, research and investment on mitigation measures to reduce wildlife mortality on roads have increased greatly (Jackson and Grifï¬n 2000; Glista et al. 2009; Polak et al. 2014; Kociolek et al. 2015; Ward et al. 2015). In railways the efforts to increase wildlife safety have not been as considerable (van der Grift 1999; Dorsey et al. 2015), and these efforts have been concentrated mostly on mitigating the impacts on existing railways, ignoring the expansion of the high-speed railway network (Dorsey et al. 2015). An important difference between roads and railways is that in the latter, the speed and trajectory of a train cannot be changed to avoid collisions; therefore, mitigation measures must rely almost entirely on preventing the animals from entering or remaining on the train tracks."
222,61,0.42,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment showed in detail how many ecosystem services across the world are under stress and in decline.

Globally, mangrove areas have been in significant decline, and natural habitats for aquatic species have shown stress due to over-exploitation and pollution (Polidoro et al. 2010). Deltas are distinct in terms of the concentration of freshwater, nutrients and especially sediment inputs to a small concentrated area of the coastal zone, creating conditions ideal for fertile ecosystems, dense population and high economic activity (Bianchi 2016). Associated ecosystem services are high in number and include benefits such as productive agriculture and aquaculture, water provision and physical protection from the periodic impacts of extreme events such as coastal storms and cyclones. Ecosystem services can act as a safety net for poor populations. Akter and Mallick (2013) show in the GBM region that those populations"

255,7,0.417,Railway Ecology,"wildlife mortality. Therefore, a careful assessment of railwaysâ impacts on nature and of mitigation measures is in order. Trains are not cars, and railway tracks are not roads. These assertions are obvious, but they are often ignored when assessing the potential and actual biodiversity impacts of railways, which are normally equated to those of roads. This is regrettable because roads and railways differ in many respects, which can strongly influence their impacts. For instance, trafï¬c on railways tends to be less intense than on roads, but trains often travel at higher speeds than cars. Roads and railways also have different physical structures, especially in the case of electriï¬ed railways, where overhead lines along the rail tracks can represent an additional source of impacts. All these differences are likely to affect wildlife responses to roads and railways, and hence their impacts on, for example, animalsâ behavior, mortality, and landscape connectivity. A quick survey of the literature shows that studies on the biodiversity impacts of railways have greatly lagged behind those of roads. This is probably because the road network is much larger than the railway network, but probably also because the impacts of roads are more easily observed by ecologists and the general public. For instance, the safety and economic costs associated with the risk of collision with a wild or domesticated animal is more easily perceived in a road than in a railway, although the latter are also very signiï¬cant: an accident with an animal is likely to go unnoticed by passengers in a train, with the remarkable exception of the train driver, but the same will not happen so easily in a car. Even the legal frameworks under which roads and railways operate can be different, conditioning the way the environment in the vicinity can be protected and which mitigation measures can be applied. All these differences add to a number of speciï¬cities that clearly set railways apart from roads, and thus a paradigm shift is needed whereby the impacts of railways on biodiversity are considered on their own. This book aims at contributing to this shift, ï¬lling a gap in the literature about the impacts of transportation on biodiversity. We have brought together 44 researchers from 12 countries, from North and South America to Asia and Europe. We aimed at combiningâin a single volumeâthe most relevant information that has been produced on the interactions between railways and wildlife, and to illustrate such interactions with a set of carefully chosen case studies from around the world. We have tried to produce a comprehensive volume that should be of interest to researchers and practitioners alike, including the staff of railway and consultancy companies that deal with the environmental challenges of railway planning, construction, and operation every day. Although this book addresses several environmental problems raised by railways, we would like its main message to be one of hope. Indeed, while we expect societies to keep looking for more efï¬cient means of transportation, we also expect that efï¬ciency to become ever more synonymous with environmental efï¬ciency, as societies seek to mitigate impacts or even improve biodiversity. We hope that our book can help achieve this goal, contributing to the mitigation of the negative impacts of railways on biodiversity, thereby improving the sustainability and environmental beneï¬ts of this mode of transportation."
233,547,0.417,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Results We found 40 Least Concern and Data Deï¬cient species that possess a high combined score of Î»M and ED (see Table 1). In total, 42 of the island mammal species we assessed were listed by the IUCN as Data Deï¬cient, 47 as Least Concern, with the remainder as threatened species. Those species already listed as threatened were potentially suffering from other threats (e.g. non-native species as predators/competitors). Focusing on those species that are Data Deï¬cient or Least Concern and have higher Î»M-ED scores would be most beneï¬cial, as their rarity indicate them to be at risk and a high Î»M value represents an important patch, and one that would pay off greatly to conserve. The ï¬ve islands with the highest average Î»M-ED scores, taken by adding all the scores and dividing by our (island-restricted mammals) species richness per island were Jamaica, Guadalcanal, Isle of Pines, Madagascar, and Nggela Sule (see Table 2, Fig. 3 for map). Interestingly, Madagascar held 39 of the highest Î»M-ED species, and ranked fourth in our Î»M-ED islands list. We found that combining evolutionary distinctness with Î»M revealed species that may be of concern that were not otherwise noticed. Because quantifying fragmentation effects on species takes into account spatial conï¬guration, this can help to improve threat status assessments. The EDGE programme has already sought to visualize regions in the world with the most rare species and moved to prioritize those particular species. This adds a spatial understanding of the species distribution to that prioritization."
246,157,0.415,Rewilding European Landscapes,"5.3 Vultures and Humans: An Unstable Alliance Top scavengers (âtrueâ vultures, Accipitridae) have been evolutionarily dependent on carcasses of large animals, mainly ungulates, grazing in open areas of southern Europe, Africa and central and southern Asia (Houston 1974, 1979; DonÃ¡zar 1993). They have in common extreme adaptations and skills aimed to locate scarce and unpredictable sources of food (Houston 1979; CortÃ©s-Avizanda et al. 2014). However, because of the rampant humanization of ecosystems, this natural scenario no longer exists, apart from some strictly protected areas, especially in African countries where large herds of ungulates subsist (CortÃ©s-Avizanda et al. 2011; Fig. 5.2). Thus, following the progressive eradication of most native populations of wild ungulates (e.g. Chap. 8), guilds of avian scavengers have become largely dependent on livestock carcasses associated with human activities (Mundy et al. 1992; DonÃ¡zar 1993). This scenario has likely remained almost unchanged since the so-called âNeolitic revolutionâ (i.e., a process in which agrarian societies began to substitute hunting around 8500 BC with agricultural practices including the domestication of the herbivores) in many regions of the Old World, and certainly in southern Europe, where the agro-grazing traditional economies remained unchanged (DonÃ¡zar et al. 1996a, 2009; Olea and Mateo-Tomas 2009; Fig. 5.3)."
36,242,0.415,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"recent research demonstrates a negative impact on birds (Hallmann et al. 2014). In North America, pesticide contamination has been implicated in bat mortality associated with the fungal pathogen causing white-nose syndrome (WNS), since pesticide load can lead to immunosuppression and endocrine disruption that could make bats more vulnerable to infection (Kannan et al. 2010). âBack of the envelopeâ calculations suggest declines in bat populations attributed to WNS could translate into an additional 1320 metric tons of insects escaping predation each year (Quarles 2013). The trickle-down impacts on agricultural production could be substantial, although quantitative evidence is lacking. The effects of GM crops incorporating insecticidal traits have been investigated largely in the context of the provisioning of predation services (Federico et al. 2008; Lopez-Hoffman et al. 2014; see next section); however, declines in pest numbers associated with the use of these crops could result in population declines of insectivorous bats (LopezHoffman et al. 2014)."
376,955,0.415,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Summary. Livestock (primarily including cattle, sheep, goats, equines, and camelids) provide the food and traditional economic basis for people living in the rangelands of developing countries; cultivation or wage employment opportunities are typically rare or nonexistent. The indigenous species and breeds are adapted to often harsh production conditions, and the flexibility of herd movement is very important for helping pastoralists cope with erratic rainfall patterns and disease outbreaks. Unlike the people on rangelands, population trends for livestock are more difficult to discern. Overall, livestock populations in some cases may exhibit âboom-and-bustâ patterns where growth periods are followed by sudden die-offs due to combinations of weather, disease, or level of forage competition among livestock. The spatial scale and frequency of herd crashes vary markedly. The difficulty in mitigating large herd losses is due to low levels of economic development and public investment. Mitigating such losses matters, however, because recurrent dieoffs translate into large economic losses for pastoral societies. For less-developed regions where human survival is most closely linked to livestock survival, the ratio of animals to people provides an important indicator of both food and asset security. Where this ratio has been monitored, the evidence shows that it has markedly"
291,42,0.414,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"3.1.2 Cause-Specific Death Counts in the United States The National Center for Health Statistics of the United States provides a unique collection: Individual death counts by sex, age at death, year of death, cause of death, and many more characteristics can be freely downloaded from its web page. The data are available since 1968 in annual files. Additionally, the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides data since 1959, which we used in our analyses. The last year in our analysis is 2014. With the exception of 1972, when only a 50% sample was taken, each file contains all deaths in the United States. In the analysis by cause of death in later chapters of this volume, we simply multiplied the number of deaths for a given age, sex, and cause in the year 1972 by a factor of 2. Causes of death are coded by the so-called âInternational Classification of Diseasesâ (ICD). Since its introduction in the late nineteenth century, the system has been revised at irregular intervals (MeslÃ© 2006). The tenth revision is currently used. During the first years of our analysis, ICD-7 was used. ICD-8 was in effect in the United States between 1968 and 1978, followed by ICD-9 from 1979 until 1998. Obtaining consistent time series of causes of death across ICD revisions requires meticulous work and care (e.g., MeslÃ© and Vallin 1996; PechholdovÃ¡ 2009). We therefore decided to use only very broad categories for causes of death and followed primarily the coding of Janssen et al. (2003) and of MeslÃ© and Vallin (2006a). Both papers include an appendix with detailed ICD codes across the four revisions required in our analysis. Table 3.2 is split into two halves. The upper panel provides the ICD codes we used to extract the causes of death, whereas the lower panel lists the number of deaths in absolute and relative terms for the selected causes by sex. Our database consists of more than 118 million deaths. Although we have selected very few causes, they account for about three quarters of all deaths (Category 13 âOtherâ is 23.75%). A bit more than 44% of all deaths classified as originating from circulatory diseases. In that category, heart diseases are about one third of all deaths for women and men alike. The almost 10 million deaths from cerebrovascular diseases between 1959 and 2014 represent about eight percent of all deaths. The most common cerebrovascular disease is stroke. Malignant neoplasms (âcancerâ) are the second largest chapter in the ICD. Regardless of sex of the decedent, about one in every fifth death belongs to that category. We"

Detailed meta-analyses of existing data on cumulative fatality impacts and factors influencing fatalities are needed. It should be noted that data disclosure from many sites by some companies hinders such analyses. We strongly encourage developers to follow guidelines (e.g., Kunz et al. 2007b; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Strickland et al. 2011; Bat Conservation Ireland 2012) consistently when implementing pre- and post-construction monitoring. Data should be placed into the public domain or preferably published in refereed journals. There are a number of policies, regulatory, and communication challenges we face in protecting bats while developing wind energy responsibly across the globe (Arnett 2012). Unless there is a federal, state, or provincial nexus, most research, siting, and mitigation efforts by wind energy developers and operating companies will be voluntary, likely without regard for cumulative effects. Sites that do trigger a regulatory nexus will usually be driven by endangered species issues (e.g., Indiana bats in the USA). It is apparent most local jurisdictional entities, regardless of country, lack experience in wildlife science, and unless they coordinate with their wildlife or natural resource agency specialists, concerns about bat fatalities may never be addressed in decision making for wind energy development. Another key issue is consistent application of regulations. The authors have encountered many situations where different individuals had varied interpretations of the same law or guidance policy, and this creates untenable situations, considerable uncertainty, consternation, and lack of trust among stakeholders that seems completely unnecessary and easily remedied (Arnett 2012). We encourage continuing cooperation among all stakeholders, gathering needed information, avoiding construction in high-risk sites, considering cumulative effects, and implementing mitigation where needed even when no regulatory process is triggered (Arnett 2012; Arnett and Baerwald 2013). Wind energy developers should, however, be treated fairly and consistently to ensure proactive measures are implemented. Arnett (2012) noted that when some companies choose to cooperate, while others may not, unnecessary angst is generated and deters resolving wildlife impacts and other issues. Decision making must be based on the best available science. Also, consistent policy, accountability, effective siting and mitigation strategies, and a âlevel-playing fieldâ for the industry (i.e., consistent requirements and incentives for all companies) are fundamental if we are to successfully develop wind energy that protects bats and other wildlife.

255,191,0.412,Railway Ecology,"Here we provide a case study on bird collisions in a railway that crosses a wetland of international importance, the Sado Estuary (Portugal), which is a RAMSAR site and a Special Protection Area for birds classiï¬ed under the European Union Directive 79/409/EEC. Especially from autumn to mid-spring, this wetland is home to thousands of waders, wildfowl, flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus, and other aquatic birds, which use a diversity of wet habitats including open water, mud flats, rice ï¬elds, and salt pans (LourenÃ§o et al. 2009; Alves et al. 2011). These birds were expected to cross the railway area on a daily basis, particularly the bridge crossing the Sado River, due to movements from roosts to feeding areas, and among feeding areas (e.g., Dias et al. 2006). Therefore, it was feared that they were exposed to a high risk of collision, with the possibility of mass mortality events occurring due to the collision of large flocks with bridge structures and circulating trains. Our study was designed to clarify this issue, aiming at: (1) quantifying bird mortality patterns due to collisions associated with the presence of the railway; (2) characterizing the movements of wetland birds crossing the railway bridge along the circadian and the annual cycles; and (3) estimating the seriousness of the risk of wetland bird mortality associated with this railway, as well as which bird species are most at risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ï¬rst published study documenting the impacts of railways on wetland bird mortality."

These indicators are connected with more extensive land-uses such as agriculture and forestry, and less with high human population densities and infrastructure. The synergies and interactions between the different elements of our wilderness mapping emphasize even further their ecological significance. In areas of high habitat quality the road mortality can be higher in absolute terms because it affects more abundant populations (Patrick et al. 2012) while road lighting can increase the impact of the road itself on the local ecological communities by favouring certain types of predation (Rich and Longcore 2005) or providing additional perches for improved hunting efficiency of raptors such as kestrels (Sheffield et al. 2001)."
255,139,0.41,Railway Ecology,"e.g. the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in water treatment works (Elliott et al. 2005). However, there are also many indirect damages that are difï¬cult to quantify because they would require a deeper understanding of the ecosystem-economy relationship (Bradshaw et al. 2016). Furthermore, many invasive species are also vectors of human diseases, such as malaria, plague, typhus or yellow fever, and their transportation may result in outbreaks of these infections in previously unsuspected areas (Lounibos 2010; Capinha et al. 2014). Also, invasive species may cause ecological or landscape changes that have negative implications for human safety, these can assume multiple forms, such as the promotion of pathogen eruptions (Vanderploeg et al. 2001), or an increase in the vulnerability of landscapes to natural hazards such as ï¬res (Berry et al. 2011). Importantly, many of the future impacts of non-native species may still remain unknown. For instance, the increased profusion of invasive species may render a cascading effect on the vulnerability of ecosystems, i.e. by making these even more susceptible to future impacts. Climate change is a further source of concern. Changes in climatic patterns altering the geography of the areas that can be invaded may put additional pressures on native biodiversity. Understanding how these processes will interact in the future to determine the impacts of biological invasions is challenging. In fact, many future invasions may have already been set in motion, i.e. many non-native species are currently in a lag-phase, i.e. with little or no increase in species occurrence, to be followed by an increase-phase in which species occurrence and invasiveness rises rapidly before becoming invaders (Aikio et al. 2010; Essl et al. 2011). Without increased efforts to manage non-native species in transportation infrastructures, including in vehicles, transported cargo and verges, the number of invasive species will likely continue to grow steadily (Keller et al. 2011). Hence, more effective policies to reduce the transport and release of non-native species, and to manage those already established, should become a priority (Pimentel et al. 2005; Keller et al. 2011)."

255,358,0.41,Railway Ecology,"and whether it could be compensated by the use of the other saltpans or other places outside the study area. We applied an experimental design that provides a spatial and temporal context to integrate the evaluation of potential impacts of railways and other line infrastructures on wetlands. Our approach surpasses the usual estimators of mortality due to the effect of barrier and evaluates the effects on the spatial and temporal distribution, survival and behaviour. This decision was made due to the nature of this railway and the mitigation measures that were decided a priori to decrease the probability of negative impacts over the aquatic birds that uses the area crossed by this infrastructure. Indeed, the construction of a viaduct over the most critical areas was a decision that decreased land reclamation on the saltpans. On the other hand, this railway was meant from the start to be used for commercial purposes, transporting containers from the harbor to the main national line. The expected trafï¬c and speed of the trains was thus limited and conditioned to speciï¬c daily periods, thus decreasing the barrier effect of this infrastructure and, hopefully, lowered the expected mortality due to collisions with the trains. In fact, during the study period, only two casualties were reported: a common Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) and an unidentiï¬ed gull. The main guidelines described in this book pertaining to future studies in railway ecology seem mostly designed to terrestrial environments (and species) and long stretches of continuous railway beds. This study dealt (albeit in a preliminary way) with some of them, namely by (1) studying species with different ecological traits (even if belonging to the same taxonomic group), (2) using an experimental analysis, which includes comparison between a control phase with the period of construction and after, (3) studying the effect of habitat fragmentation (in this case, how the birds responded to the loss/degradation of the impacted saltpans both in the breeding season and in winter, and (4) a preliminary study of the population persistence in the area after the railway construction. In our view, the most interesting feature of the present study is the integration of several spatial scales, from the macroscale of other case studies (see Chaps. 7 and 11) to the microscale of the habitat. This option was imposed by the nature of the problem itself and allowed us to go beyond the usual evaluation of mortality of adult birds due to collisions (Chap. 7) or the general patterns of disturbance and habitat loss (Chap. 11), and changed the focus of analysis to the impact of disturbance (both on the breeding and wintering birds) and chick mortality at smaller scales (habitat), a feature that is seldom attempted. We have developed a conceptual methodology where the rationale is hypothesis-based and uses a Before-After-Control-Impact comparative approach (as advised in the guidelines of Chap. 19). We think that it can be easily extended to the same or other aquatic bird species and habitats affected by railways in the wetland areas, enabling a multi-scale habitat analysis that can be combined with the usual broad scope procedures. Although the method has the potential to be improved and reï¬ned, we feel that it represents an add-on to the arsenal of methods of analysis in future studies of railway ecology, as those proposed in Chap. 19."

260,134,0.408,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Decades of research, especially in amphibians, have demonstrated that predators can alter the physiology, behavior, and morphology of individuals and populations (Tollrian and Harvell 1999). The threat of predation can alter the production of the stress hormone corticosterone in tadpoles (Fraker et al. 2009), and thus presumably their immunocompetence. Recently, several studies have examined the influence of predation risk on disease outcomes using caged predators, which emit chemical cues (i.e., kairomones), but prevent the predator from contacting and killing the prey. Kerby et al. (2011) found that infection prevalence and mortality increased in ATVexposed larval tiger salamanders when exposed to chemical cues from larval dragonfly predators (Anax junius) compared to controls. However, Haislip et al. (2012) found no effect of predator cues on mortality or infection in a similar set of experiments with four species of larval anurans (L. clamitans, L. sylvaticus, P. feriarum, and Hyla chrysoscelis) and two predator species (Anax sp. and Belostoma flumineum). Similarly, Reeve et al. (2013) found no effect of caged predators (dytiscid beetle larvae and dragonfly larvae) on mortality rates of wood frog tadpoles in laboratory or mesocosm experiments. In this experiment, glucocorticoid concentrations did not differ between the control and predator cue treatments, suggesting either that predator stress does not universally elevate corticosterone production or that the effect dissipates with time. Thus, it seems that predators do not make anuran larvae more susceptible to ranavirus infection, although studies with additional species would be helpful. In addition, although other putative stressors, such as food-level reductions significantly increased glucocorticoid concentrations, tadpoles were not more likely to become infected or experience ranavirus-induced mortality (Reeve et al. 2013). Thus even energetically challenged, physiological stressed amphibians may not be more susceptible to ranaviruses."
36,432,0.408,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"11.2 Composition and Estimates of Bat Fatalities We present information on estimates of bat fatalities as reported in published literature or publically available reports, but caution that studies had varying levels of effort, used different estimators (e.g., Huso 2011; Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2013) and different methods to quantify bias (Arnett et al. 2008; Strickland et al. 2011), thus biasing estimates. Also, most estimators fail to adequately account for unsearched area near turbines (Huso and Dalthorp 2013), which further biases estimates. Some studies report fatalities/turbine and others fatalities/MW of installed capacity. As such, data presented here offer a general and relative sense of fatalities within and among continents and do not represent quantitative comparisons."
36,437,0.408,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"11.2.3 Africa Little work has been done on wind energy facilities in Africa, and prior to 2012, no studies had been published from the continent. During a pilot study at a single turbine located in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, Doty and Martin (2012) found 18 carcasses of 2 species of batsâthe Cape serotine (Neoromicia capensis) and Egyptian free-tailed bat (Tadarida aegyptiaca). No estimates of fatality rates were provided, likely because of small sample size of recovered carcasses and no bat carcasses were used during field bias trials. In the Western Cape of South Africa, Aronson et al. (2013) reported only one carcass of a Cape serotine. These studies confirm at least some species of bats are vulnerable to wind turbine mortality in South Africa, which could have implications for ecosystem function and conservation of bats in this region."
36,72,0.405,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"3.2.7 Cumulative Effects, Extinction Debt and the Importance of Scale Most of the factors discussed above will be cumulative. The effects of each individually need not therefore be great for the combination to have a profound effect on a bat population. Furthermore, in many cases there will be a lag, known as the extinction debt, between cause and effect (e.g. Tilman et al. 1994; Loehle and Li 1996). This is illustrated in Fig. 3.4. The effects of habitat loss and reduced habitat quality on the distribution of flying bats may be seen quickly, as bats alter their foraging and commuting behaviour to adapt as best they can to the altered landscape. Collision mortality, unless very high, may not have a significant and detectable effect for several generations. The barrier effect may take several more generations to show itself, since it is likely to involve the decline and/or relocation of nursery and other roosts, but it too may be rapid, for example when bats are completely excluded from key foraging areas. Although no data exist for bats, a study of the effects of roads on wetland biodiversity (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibian and plants) suggests that the full effects may not be seen for several decades (Findlay and Bourdages 2000). This has important implications for monitoring the effects of roads and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation, as discussed later."

182,208,0.402,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"as key threats to human health in newly independent and developing agrarian nations.128 The Committee was tasked with identifying zoonoses that were evident âworld problemsâ and for which effective control measures had already been developed.129 Over the next decade, it agreed a standard definition of these diseases, which brought over 100 different infections under one general category, creating fertile terrain for veterinarians to expand their international role in human health.130 Perceptions of zoonotic disease threats had shifted significantly in the context of the world hunger campaign. Previously, the animals affected had been regarded as costly impediments to agricultural production, and as transmitters of infections to humans. However, their promotion as food sources for hungry humans led to the realization that, in addition, these animals produced less food for humans, thereby posing dual threats to human health. This was highlighted by one of the Committeeâs leading experts, the Swiss-American veterinary scientist Karl Meyer, in a technical paper on âThe Zoonoses in Their Relation to Rural Healthâ that he presented, on Kaplanâs invitation, to the Seventh World Health Assembly: One need only to consider all of the adverse effects of the zoonoses to realize the urgency of control: loss of life, acute and chronic illness of inhabitants of rural areas, loss of life and impairment of productivity of farm animals with all of the social and economic implications, and loss of life and acute and chronic illness of city dwellers to whom the zoonoses may spread â¦ These infections unquestionably have far-reaching economic aspects; they may mean mere loss of profit or they may mean critical want. In some areas they preclude the raising of livestock altogether â¦ in others they make an already poverty-stricken group poorer still and deny food supply to undernourished populations. In their destruction of food supply alone they are major economic problems. Some of the diseases â¦ are detrimental to rural populations because of their direct effects on health of farm people, making habitation in rural areas impossible or hazardous; some are more important in their effect on the worldâs food supply.131"

36,492,0.401,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"decades later, nearly twice as many species (N = 92) are known to be hunted, representing over half of the 183 recognized species of Old World fruit bats (IUCN 2014) (Table 12.1). Although there has been relatively little research explicitly focused on quantifying hunting impacts, the general level of concern about hunting effects on bat conservation has increased. Using Old World fruit bats as an example, in the first review, hunting was not considered a threat for most (60 %) of the hunted species (Mickleburgh et al. 1992). Now, all but five of these hunted species (25/30, 83 %) have been moved up to a higher threat status because of perceived pressures that hunting causes (IUCN 2014). Overhunting is a recognized factor in the loss of three (and probably also the little known fourth) of the now extinct fruit bat species (IUCN 2014) and a cause behind local extirpations within speciesâ historic distributions (e.g. Polynesian sheath-tailed bat, Emballonura semicaudata, from Vanuatu, Helgen and Flannery 2002). Similarly, the declines of seven of the ten fruit bat species listed as critically endangered are attributed directly to hunting; the remaining three species are still virtually unknown (IUCN 2014) (Table 12.2). The increased concern about bat hunting may be due to greater hunting pressure, or may just represent our increased awareness of hunting impacts. What is clear is that bat conservation biologists now explicitly attribute species declines and increased extinction risk to hunting. Seven hunted bat species previously assumed to be unaffected by hunting (Mickleburgh et al. 1992) now have hunting listed as a major threat (IUCN 2014). Most (68 %) of the species that are hunted, are listed as threatened by that hunting, while only 15 % of the hunted species are expected not to be affected. However, it should be pointed out that for the remaining 38 % of hunted species, reviews remain ambivalent about whether hunting is a problem. Similarly, in the review of bats as bushmeat carried out in 2004 (Mickleburgh et al. 2009), 59 % of questionnaire respondents said bat hunting Table 12.2 Comparison of the conservation status of old world fruit bat species across two decades from two sets of species accounts: 1992 IUCN Action Plan (Mickleburgh et al. 1992); 2014 IUCN Red List; and for comparison, the 2009 Bats as Bushmeat review (Mickleburgh et al. 2009) # species considered"
169,152,0.401,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"that are sustainable for benthic organisms and therefore affect the food web structure. In these studies, the trophic structure was reduced by one trophic level between macroinvertebrates and ï¬sh. Fish had to compensate this lack by increased feeding on baseline taxa. Additionally, there is experimental evidence that drift rates of more vagile organisms, e.g., juvenile graylings, remained unchanged during ï¬ow ï¬uctuations with varying up-ramping rates (Schmutz et al. 2013), showing that the effect of reducing up-ramping rates as a mitigating measure most likely is species and life stage speciï¬c. At least for juvenile grayling, the risk for drift is higher during nighttime in summer, but could decrease when up-ramping rates were reduced from 3.0 to 0.5 cm/min (Auer et al. 2017). For ï¬sh, the abruptness of the ï¬ow decrease (down-ramping rate) seems to be of higher importance than the increase. A fast water level decrease may lead to increased stranding risk for organisms because they may not be able to perform a lateral shift fast enough with a rapidly sinking water level. Several studies observed a positive relationship between stranding and down-ramping rate (Bauersfeld 1978; Hunter 1992; Bradford et al. 1995). For brown trout Halleraker et al. (2003) found a signiï¬cantly decreased stranding rate, when down-ramping rate was reduced from 60 to 10 cm/h. Recent experiments at the HyTEC facility support a signiï¬cant relationship between stranding risk and down-ramping rate, depending on species and live stage. For example, stranding of larval graylings during diurnal single-peak experiments vanished at a down-ramping rate of 0.2 cm/min compared to 50% stranding at 2.9 cm/min. A similar relation was identiï¬ed for larval brown trout, although stranding risk vanished only below 0.1 cm/min. Juvenile grayling could avoid stranding during a down-ramping rate of 3.0 cm/min, and juvenile brown trout, despite their vulnerability as larvae, actually could adapt to a rate of 6.4 cm/ min (Auer et al. 2014, 2017). However, there is also evidence that seasonal and daily variation play an important role in terms of stranding risk (see Sect. 5.3.3)."
364,244,0.4,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Farmers and fishermen perceive the risks associated with environmental degradation and its long-term negative consequences as affecting not only themselves but the community as a whole. The risks are of both natural and anthropogenic origins. Those of natural origin include typhoons, strong winds, El NiÃ±o, and seasonal variations brought about by climate and/or weather disturbances. In Silang-Santa Rosa, these have the effects of altering the crop cycle, and reducing crop productivity and income. Other types of risks include outbreaks of pests and diseases, crop losses from toxic chemicals, soil erosion and acidity, depressed market prices, and land use conversion. Farmers and fishermen have faced these risks to some degree for years. However, in the upstream, 46 % claimed that their level of exposure to such risks is low. A low level of exposure was also cited by 25 % in the midstream, 100 % in the upper downstream, and 50 % in the lower downstream. This can be attributed to the respondentsâ resiliency and the measures they have adopted to address the risks. Factors affecting their level of resiliency include their earning capacity, family assets, and asset management, as well as support from family and relatives that provide financial assistance in times of need. One specific adaptive measure taken in Silang-Santa Rosa is to immediately replant to replace damaged crops. Otherwise farmers simply wait for crops to recover naturally, or go and seek off-farm or nonfarm employment. However, these adaptive measures are generally makeshift and do little to reduce the impacts of climatic events and other forms of risks. They are also very dependent"

291,91,0.399,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"9.2 Results Our data and results are displayed in five panels for each selected cause. On the first page for each cause, we show the observed (ârawâ) monthly numbers of death by calendar time and single age (adjusted for a duration of 30 days) in the upper panel. The panel below plots the fit of the model, i.e., the combined pattern of the trend and the sine and the cosine surfaces, which is equivalent to the observed counts minus the (raw) residuals; see, for example, Fig. 9.2 on page 103 for mortality from all causes combined for women. Our main interest is displayed on the second page for each cause. The top panel shows the estimated trend surface vat . In the case of seasonality of all-cause mortality among US women (Fig. 9.3), we can see that the number of deaths from that category increases with age and reaches its âhotspotâ for octogenarians before the numbers of death decline again. As the trend surface plots the seasonally-adjusted density of deaths, the lower number of deaths for nonagenarians are the consequence of less people being alive rather than a decline in the risk of dying. Even without the additional seasonal component, up to 3,500 women died at a single age during a single month. The height of âexcess mortalityâ is depicted by the amplitude in the middle panel. Higher ages correspond not only to higher mortality; the colors and the contour lines suggest that mortality differences between winter and summer also become larger at higher ages. Increasing seasonality with age has already been described by Adolphe Quetelet in 1838 and is typically also found in more contemporary populations (Feinstein 2002; McDowall 1981; Rau and Doblhammer 2003; Rau 2007). Over time we can not really discern a clear trend. It seems rather that deaths for 70-year-old women in the US are about 10% higher during the peak season and about 15% higher for 90-yearold women than on average during a year. If we multiply the seasonal estimate of a given age and calendar time (e.g., 1.1) with the corresponding square of the trend surface (e.g., 1,500 deaths), we obtain the fitted value (e.g., 1,650 deaths) shown in the lower panel on the previous page. When the peak season occurs in a year is illustrated in the lower panel. The colors indicate a value slightly below 30. Hence, deaths occur most often in the end of January, regardless of age or calendar year. The corresponding plots for men are depicted in Figs. 9.4 and 9.5. While male mortality is higher than female mortality at any ageâat least in highly developed countries, the seasonal characteristics are rather similar between the two sexes: The proportion of excess deaths during winter varies between 5% at age 50 and 15% at age 90 with no apparent period effect. Also the part of the year when deaths peak among men occurs at the end of January. Those seasonal mortality similarities between women and men are not only present for all-cause mortality but also for most causes of death. That is why we restricted ourselves to show only the results for women but they apply equally to men. We show the results for men only in the case of motor vehicle accident because much less women die of that cause. The largest subcategory analyzed by us in this chapter is death from heart diseases (see Figs. 9.6 and 9.7, pp. 107â108). Up to 1,300 deaths were recorded at a single age during a single month of a given year. As we can infer from the"

169,147,0.398,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Flow ï¬uctuations induced by hydropeaking operation can have tremendous shortand long-term effects on riverine organisms. Due to increasing hydraulic forces, organisms may get abraded from underlying substrate and drift downstream or must invest signiï¬cant amounts of energy to avoid downstream displacement during a hydropeaking event. Unintentional drift downstream results in relocation to a possibly less suitable habitat, as well as in physiological, mechanical, or predatory stress. A lateral habitat shift of vagile organisms may help them remain in habitats with suitable hydraulic conditions, but this tactic is linked to a risk of stranding during water level declines. Furthermore, high mechanical stress through increased sediment mobilization and sediment transport can harm organisms or may lead to a decreased primary production (Hall et al. 2015). Besides reducing biomass and abundance, artiï¬cial sub-daily ï¬ow and water temperature ï¬uctuations may also have negative effects on growth, survival rates, reproduction, and biotic integrity"
230,118,0.398,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract In this review we report new findings concerning interaction between marine debris and wildlife. Deleterious effects and consequences of entanglement, consumption and smothering are highlighted and discussed. The number of species known to have been affected by either entanglement or ingestion of plastic debris has doubled since 1997, from 267 to 557 species among all groups of wildlife. For marine turtles the number of affected species increased from 86 to 100 % (now 7 of 7 species), for marine mammals from 43 to 66 % (now 81 of 123 species) and for seabirds from 44 to 50 % of species (now 203 of 406 species). Strong increases in records were also listed for fish and invertebrates, groups that were previously not considered in detail. In future records of interactions between marine debris and wildlife we recommend to focus on standardized data on frequency of occurrence and quantities of debris ingested. In combination with dedicated impact studies in the wild or experiments, this will allow more detailed assessments of the deleterious effects of marine debris on individuals and populations.

260,10,0.395,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"upon a number of factors. Brunner et al. (2015) describe how ranaviruses could contribute to species declines using epidemiological theory and results from mathematical simulations. However, because there have been very few long-term longitudinal studies on populations with reoccurring ranavirus die-offs, data necessary to address population and species declines are scarce. Recent studies are beginning to address this deficiency. Stephen Price and colleagues recently reported ranavirusinduced declines in three amphibian species at several sites in northern Spain (Price et al. 2014). Amber Teacher and colleagues analyzed an 11-year dataset in England, and found about an 80 % decline in common frog abundance at ranavirus die-off sites (Teacher et al. 2010). Jim Petranka and several other ecologists have observed no recruitment in consecutive years at sites with ranavirus die-offs (Petranka et al. 2003; Wheelwright et al. 2014). Julia Earl showed in closed populations of wood frogs that reoccurring outbreaks of ranavirus could result in population extinction in as quickly as 5 years (Earl and Gray 2014). These studies suggest that several elements are in place (e.g., high susceptibility among several host species, possible density-independent transmission) for ranaviruses to cause local population extinction and thereby contribute to species declines. However, to date, species extinction due to ranaviral disease has not been reported. This uncertainty emphasizes the need for more intensive investigations in ranavirus surveillance and population monitoring, which is outlined in Gray et al. (2015). Importantly, we should not sit idly until there is definitive evidence of species extinctions due to ranavirus. The writing is on the wall suggesting its potential threat, especially considering that many rare species are hosts for ranaviruses. For example, the highly endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus, Geng et al. 2010), gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus, Westhouse et al. 1996), dusky gopher frog (Lithobates sevosus, Sutton et al. 2014), and boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas, J. Chaney, M. Gray, and D. Miller, University of Tennessee, unpublished data) are very susceptible to ranaviral disease. Additional investigations are needed to identify other rare species that are highly susceptible (Gray et al. 2015). In captivity, 100 % mortality of hosts is commonly observed likely due to abundant hosts, guaranteed transmission, and stress associated with these environments (Waltzek et al. 2014). Several species of economic (e.g., bullfrogs, Mazzoni et al. 2009; grouper, Qin et al. 2001) and conservation concern (e.g., pallid sturgeon, Waltzek et al. 2014; Chinese giant salamander, Geng et al. 2010; Cunningham et al. 2015) have experienced catastrophic losses in captivity due to ranaviruses. Given this preliminary information on the possible effects of ranaviruses on highly susceptible hosts, we believe it is reasonable to consider this pathogen a serious threat to the biodiversity of ectothermic vertebrate species. Another question that frequently arises is, âAre ranaviruses emerging?â In other words, âAre ranaviruses increasing in distribution, prevalence, or host range?â Again, this is a challenging question to answer, but there is information that suggests, âYes.â Andrew Storfer provided evidence, based on a lack of coevolutionary history between virus and host, that Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) emerged in some locations (Storfer et al. 2007). His work suggests that emergence of ATV was likely a consequence of the trade in larval salamanders as fishing bait and"

255,308,0.394,Railway Ecology,"Introduction Linear transportation infrastructures such as roads and railways are increasing worldwide, and this is generally considered a serious threat to wildlife conservation (van der Ree et al. 2015). Transportation infrastructure networks are particularly dense in developed countries, with a recent study showing that in Europe about 50% of the land area is within 1.5 km of a paved road or railway line (Torres et al. 2016). This problem also increasingly affects less developed countries, where most infrastructure and urban development is expected to take place over the coming decades (Seto et al. 2012). Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate the impacts of linear infrastructure development on wildlife, and to devise planning and technical solutions to mitigate such impacts (DeFries et al. 2012). The impacts of linear transportation infrastructures are generally associated with direct mortality caused by animal collisions with circulating vehicles (Loss et al. 2015; Santos et al. 2016), and with barrier effects and the consequent increases in habitat fragmentation and reduced landscape connectivity (Carvalho et al. 2016). However, there may also be widespread indirect habitat degradation, because many animal species avoid using areas close to transportation infrastructures (Forman and Deblinger 2000; Torres et al. 2016). For instance, a recent study showed that many bird species strongly avoided trafï¬c noise, while certain others remaining close to noisy environments exhibited degradation in body condition (Ware et al. 2015). Another study showed that even unpaved roads reduced herbivore densities in a protected area (DâAmico et al. 2016). Most of these studies, however, have focused on roads, either ignoring railways or assuming that roads and railways have largely similar impacts (e.g. Torres et al. 2016). Furthermore, the few studies available are contradictory (see Chap. 6), with some pointing out negative effects of noise, lights and vibrations associated with circulating trains, while others suggest that wildlife ignore or adapt to railway disturbance (Owens 1977; Waterman et al. 2002; Gosh et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010; Mundahl et al. 2013; Wiacek et al. 2015). Thus, more information is needed on the exclusion effects of railways, particularly on the species and ecological conditions associated with the most negative effects. If railways have strong exclusion effects, their consequences may be particularly serious when crossing wetland habitats. This is because wetlands are declining fast,"

231,1180,0.392,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Year-Class Strength and Implications for Fisheries Fishers and scientists have known for over 100 years that the status of ï¬sh stocks can be greatly influenced by prevailing climatic conditions (Hjort 1914; Cushing 1982). âRecruitmentâ variability is a key measure of stock productivity, and is deï¬ned as the number of juvenile ï¬sh surviving from the annual egg production to be exploited by the ï¬shery. Recruitment is critically dependent on the match or mismatch between the occurrence of the larvae and availability of their zooplankton food (Cushing 1990) as well as other processes that affect early life-history stages (see Petitgas et al. 2013). Empirical data on exploited populations often show strong relationships between recruitment success, ï¬sheries catches and climatic variables. These strong relationships have been demonstrated, for example, for cod (OâBrien et al. 2000; Brander and Mohn 2004; Cook and Heath 2005), plaice (Brunel and Boucher 2007), herring (Nash and Dickey-Collas 2005), mackerel (Jansen and Gislason 2011) and seabass (Pawson 1992). Correlations have been found between ï¬sh recruitment and various climate variables, including sea surface temperature, the NAO and even offshore winds (Table 12.2). A number of publications describing the impact of climate variability (e.g. the NAO and AMO) on small pelagic ï¬shes such as herring, anchovy or sardine in the North Sea have been published in recent years, for example those of Alheit et al. (2012) and GrÃ¶ger et al. (2010). According to the most recent assessment of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the NAO is one of the climate indices for which it is most difï¬cult to provide accurate future projections (IPCC 2013). Recent multi-model studies (e.g. Karpechko 2010) suggest overall that the NAO is likely to become slightly more positive (on average) in the future due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, a slight tendency towards enhanced recruitment and larval abundance of these species in the future could be expected if the relationships observed in the past continue to hold. In the case of cod, there is a well-established relationship between recruitment and sea temperature (OâBrien et al. 2000; Beaugrand et al. 2003), but this relationship varies with regard to the different cod stocks that inhabit the North Atlantic (Planque and FrÃ©dou 1999). For stocks at the northern extremes (e.g. in the Barents Sea) or the western Atlantic (e.g. Labrador), warming leads to enhanced recruitment, while in the North Sea, close to the southern limits of the range, warmer conditions lead to weaker than average year classes (Drinkwater 2005). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, cold conditions were correlated with a sequence of positive recruitment years in North Sea cod"

Bridging organizations, such as GNESA, bridge the boundaries between stakeholders that operate at different scales, linking varied constituencies to increase collective capabilities and social capital (Pretty 2003; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007).

308,231,0.392,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"twentieth century, there are still many blacks suffering from degradation, crime, instability, and inequality, both in education and health services. It is amazing to ï¬nd USA spending the greatest amount of money ($7285 on each individual health in 2010) [1] while in Finland they only spent $2840 on each individual; but the infant mortality rate in USA was double that of Finland [1]. In fact all the health indices put by WHO viz Infant Mortality Rate (the numbers of babies under 1 year that die in a certain year out of 1000, 1-year-old babies) or the 5-year mortality rate (the number of children under 5 who die in a certain year out of 1000 ï¬ve-year olds) or longevity rateâ¦or the number of women who die in parturition (delivery) or post partum in 100,000 deliveries in a certain year, or the number of persons who die in trafï¬c accidents per 100,000 in a certain year in a certain country and so forth. In all these indices, USA is the worst of all industrialized 28 nations. Beauchamp and Childress in âPrinciples of Biomedical Ethicsâ [2] say: âMore than 40 million US citizens (approximately 18 % of the nonelderly population) lack health insurance of any kind. Inadequate insurance affects those who are uninsured, uninsurable, underinsured, or only occasionally insured. Although each year USA spends more resources on health care than any country in the world (double or almost triple any industrialized country, and 20 times what Cuba spends), it is the only industrialized nation with less than half of its population eligible for public health insuranceâ [2, 3]. âMore than 50 million non elderly adults in the USâapproximately 1/3 of that populationâexperience a gap in coverage within a 2-year period, approximately 2/ 3 of these have no insurance for at least one year [2]. âMany uninsured persons are employed, but by companies offering no health beneï¬ts. This situation is common with employees of small ï¬rms for whom the costs of maintaining insurance are much higher than for large employers. Many employee beneï¬t packages also provide no coverage for dependents or part-time employeesâ [2, 4]. âOther US citizens are uninsurable, although many of them are employed by ï¬rms offering health coverage. The problem for them is that they are required to give full family and personal medical histories and to be examined fully prior to being eligible for insurance. Those with poor health or pre-existing conditions or family history of certain diseases are denied coverage or offered inferior and more expensive coverage. Many persons suffering from diseases that could need expensive medical management in the future are denied coverage. People who have HIV positive tests are also denied any coverageâ [2]. It is strange to ï¬nd some big ï¬rms in the USA denying their employees or some of them, any medical insurance. The law in the USA allows employers to offer or deny medical insurance coverage for their employees. The companies that offer medical insurance to its employees ï¬nd it difï¬cult to compete with the companies that offer no insurance beneï¬t. This is partially redressed by reducing taxes of those offering insurance beneï¬ts. The system in the USA serves the wealthy, the big ï¬rms and companies.

In part, the conservation value of the phylogenetic approach is in its ability to guide pre-emptive actions towards identifying and prioritizing the most at-risk species. For example, by identifying species with traits or in regions that predispose them to high risk of extinction, we can identify species that are not yet at risk of extinction but which might become threatened in the near future if current extinction drivers increase in intensity or geographic extent. Cardillo et al. (2006) referred to such species as having high âlatent riskâ of extinction. Given limited conservation funding, focusing efforts on species with high latent risk might make economic sense as it is likely to be more"

The health of the benthos and plankton groupsâdefined by their abundance, biomass, diversity, and productivityâdetermines or controls the larger organisms in the food web. The terminal elements of a food web are not sustainable if their food supplies fail or if their food sources are altered significantly. This summary does not include finfish, commercially important invertebrates, mammals, turtles, or birds. This summary addresses communities or assemblages of organisms, sometimes referred to as biotopes, in a variety of habitats. These assemblages of organisms can each be defined by their quantitative abundances and biomasses and their biodiversities within volumes of water or sea surface areas, usually per m2. In addition, where useful and available, the several dominant organisms are listed by their common and scientific names. Species lists are not provided, although references in the literature that contain such lists are given. The Gulf of Mexico offshore ecosystem is divided up into salient habitats, and each contains its own suites of organisms (e.g., assemblages or biotopes).

Income impacts for the four states equaled $2.1 billion in 2009, and that represented a decline when compared to 2007. Regarding the recreational sector, topics considered in this chapter include expenditures and impact, angler participation, trips, and catch and harvest. The analysis was based almost exclusively on Marine Recreational Information Program statistics, the new name for Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRIP/MRFSS), the most continuous and long-term monitoring program on recreational fishing patterns available. Texas opted out of this program and, therefore, is largely excluded from this report with the exception of expenditures and impacts. At the top end in terms of economic impacts, about 42,000 jobs were generated in Florida in response to recreational fishing activities, with an associated $2.4 billion in income. On the bottom end, about 3,200 jobs were generated in Mississippi, with an associated income of $162 million. Louisiana was in the middle of these numbers, with the generation of almost 20,000 jobs and almost $1.0 billion in additional income. Table 1.4 shows the economic impact associated with Gulf of Mexico angling activities from 2006 to 2009. Overall, marine recreational fishing participation in three of the four states increased significantly from the mid-1990s, with Mississippi being the sole exception. While fishing participation increased substantially, much of the growth occurred prior to the mid-2000s. It is likely that the combination of high fuel prices in recent years, along with the downturn in the economy, negatively influenced both participation and the number of trips. While the MRFSS/MRIP represents the primary data source for tracking participation over time, state-issued marine fishing license sales also can be used to track changes, but this is subject to a number of caveats. A comparison between MRFSS/MRIP participation estimates and license sales for both Louisiana and Mississippi was prepared to determine whether license sales track with MRFSS/MRIP estimates in a reasonable manner. Disturbingly, some significant differences were noted with the MRFSS/MRIP estimates, which exceeded license sales by a large margin. While there are explanations for these observed differences (for example, a license is not required for saltwater fishing in Louisiana for those under the age of 16), the differences are large enough to justify further examination of the MRFSS/MRIP participation data. The number of Gulf angler trips (excluding Texas) increased from about 17 million annually during the decade of the 1990s to 23 million annually during the 2000s, with a sharp increase in the number of angler trips beginning in 2000. The explanation for this sharp increase in the number of angler trips is open to speculation, but it does coincide with a sharp increase in the number of nonresident participants in Florida. Florida accounted for approximately 70 % of total Gulf trips during the analysis period, and about one-half of those trips were in inland waters. Louisiana accounted for another 17 % of the total, and about 85 % of the Louisianabased trips were taken in inland waters. Given that the vast majority of Louisianaâs fishing activities take place in inshore waters, it comes as no surprise that targeting behavior and catch are also largely associated with those species utilizing inshore habitat, and the two primary species include red drum and spotted seatrout. Fully 50 % of all Louisiana-based angling trips target spotted seatrout, and with the catch averaging about 20 million fish per year, Louisiana accounts for about 60 % of the Gulfâs total spotted seatrout catch, in terms of numbers of fish. Similarly, Louisiana accounts for about 80 % of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico red drum harvest, in terms of pounds. While there is considerable red drum and spotted seatrout catch in Florida waters, the state can also lay claim to a large offshore fishery component, where reef fish are generally the target. In summary, given its diversity of species, the Gulf of Mexico offers ample opportunities to both commercial and recreational fishermen. Both of these sectors generate considerable"
36,474,0.389,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.1 Introduction Most of the chapters in this book (Voigt and Kingston 2016) consider negative consequences for bats from indirect effects of anthropogenic perturbations. In contrast, this chapter explores the direct exploitation of bats by humans for bushmeat and medicine. A global review of bats as bushmeat was published in 2009 providing an overview of bat hunting based on published literature and a questionnaire widely distributed among bat biologists in 2004 (Mickleburgh et al. 2009). Here, we summarize what is currently known about the exploitation of bats for consumption and medicinal use, synthesizing the 2009 review with what has been published since and unpublished information the authors have gathered from colleagues. The result is a comprehensive list of hunted bats species that contains nearly twice as many species as known from either the IUCN Red List species accounts or the 2009 review. It is unclear whether the increased concern about hunting is the result of greater actual hunting pressure, or just represents our increased understanding of hunting impacts. What is clear is that reviews now explicitly attribute species declines and extinction risk to hunting pressure. Most of the chapter discusses conservation needs in light of what is known about bat hunting. We summarize regional patterns in bat hunting and protection efforts and highlight areas of conservation concern. We provide details of current research aimed at learning more about hunting impacts, and we give examples of management activities to strengthen protection efforts against population-level effects of hunting. We end with recommendations for research to better understand the effects of hunting on bat populations as well as strategies for effectively managing hunting to support bat conservation. All common and scientific species names follow Simmons (2005)."

A similar route for plastic ingestion was proposed by Di Beneditto and Ramos (2014), who showed that plastic in franciscana dolphins was related to benthic feeding habits, in which disturbance of sediment probably induced accidental intake of plastic debris. Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) may take up plastic accidentally during foraging on plants (Beck and Barros 1991). Pelagic loggerhead sea turtles may ingest plastic because they feed indiscriminately or graze on organisms settled on floating plastic (McCauley and Bjorndal 1999; Tomas et al. 2002). A special case of such accidental ingestion is known for the Laysan albatross who take up plastic particles in combination with eggs strings of flying fish. The fishes attach their eggs to floating items: previously seaweed, bits of wood or pumice, but nowadays often plastic objects (Pettit et al. 1981). This phenomenon has also been observed in loggerhead turtles. The plastic in their stomachs was sometimes covered by the eggs of the insect Halobates micans (Frick et al. 2009). A final case of unintentional plastic ingestion is that of secondary ingestion, which occurs when animals feed on prey, which had already ingested debris. This may concern both prey swallowed as a whole or scavenging. In seabirds, skuas are known to forage on smaller seabirds that consume plastic (Ryan 1987). Great skuas (Stercorarius skua) from the South Atlantic Ocean predate several seabird species, and their regurgitated boluses showed a link with the amount of secondarily ingested plastic and their main prey species (Bourne and Imber 1982; Ryan and Fraser 1988). In the monitoring study on northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) in the North Sea intact stomachs from scavenged fulmars or black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were occasionally found, which contained plastic (Van Franeker et al. 2011). A spectacular example of secondary ingestions was provided by Perry et al. (2013) who reported a ball of nylon fishing line in the stomach of a little auk (Alle alle), that was found in the stomach of a goose fish (Lophius americanus). The presence of small plastic particles in the faeces of fur seals on Macquarie Island was attributed to secondary ingestion through the consumption of myctophid fishes (Eriksson and Burton 2003). High abundance of small plastics in myctophid fishes (Boerger et al. 2010; Davison and Asch 2011), in combination with the fact that this type of fish is a common prey for many larger marine predators, suggest that secondary ingestion may be more common than reported."
126,258,0.388,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"â¢ The economic decline of the Dasanech, the dominant sequence of which is summarized Fig. 7.7, is evident from household data collected by this writer, in 1970/1972 and 2009/2010. Of 75 households surveyed in the 1970s, information was updated for 35 of them in the latter period (Table 7.2). Households from the original survey were randomly selected from four of the six major pastoral settlement areas indicated in Fig. 7.5. A number of patterns are evident from these household timeline data: â¢ All of the 35 households recorded had relocatedâmostly to the riverine/delta zoneâdue to major changes in their key production activities.5 Most had diversiï¬ed their production from herding to include flood recession agriculture or ï¬shing, or both. Nearly all households moved part or all of their members to the riverine/delta region, seasonally or year round. Signiï¬cant shifts in authority and other social relations have accompanied these changes (Fig. 7.10). â¢ Precipitous herd decline has overwhelmingly driven this economic transformation (with minor exception). Some households lost all livestock; most lost a quarter to two-thirds of their cattle, while small stock losses varied considerably. â¢ As cattle herds have declined, Dasanech herders have relied more on small stock since they are far more adapted to degraded pastures and to days without watering. Dasanech long-term cultural preference for cattle over small stock has been dominated by this necessary shift. Dasanech herd owners on the west bank and in the delta were interviewed concerning their loss of livestock to disease. A typical response was: Only a few people near Omorate got help for livestock diseases. Those living in the delta and the whole west bank received no help from the government. â¢ Some herd owners diversiï¬ed their economic production and managed to partially rebuild small stock herds though barter or sale of grain or ï¬sh."
169,802,0.388,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"by data at scales larger than landscape, since ï¬sh biodiversity is related to their mobility and, ultimately, to water network connectivity (Ouedraogo 2010; Melcher et al. 2012; Stranzl 2014; KaborÃ© et al. 2016a; KaborÃ© 2016; Mano 2016). In general, ï¬sh taxa exhibit lower numbers and body mass as human-induced impacts increase (Fig. 27.4). More speciï¬cally, ï¬sh taxa can be used as bioindicators of the impacts of anthropogenic pressures either in the positive or negative sense. For example, Stranzl (2014) and Mano (2016) concluded that Auchenoglanis gen. and Hydrocynus gen. could be used as sentinel genera because they are not found in areas of high anthropogenic impact. Clarias sp. and Sarotherodon sp. increase with pressures, unlike other species, e.g., Alestes sp. and Schilbe sp., which are sensitive and decrease in number as pressures rise. Hemichromis and, especially, Tilapia correlate positively with hydro-morphological pressure, but they respond negatively to chemical impacts."
36,499,0.388,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.5.2 Determining Hunting Impacts on Bat Populations To directly study the impacts of hunting, research must measure and compare hunting mortality rates to a bat populationsâ size and capacity for growth. To date, there are only a few studies that have tried to evaluate the sustainability of bat hunting. The first was Halsteadâs (1977) on the Ile-Ife campus of the University in Nigeria, which was unfortunately cut short by his return to the UK. Brooke and Tschapka (2002) modeled what would be âsustainable takeâ on Niue, based on the current bat population size and estimated reproductive rates. Comparing their modeled sustainable take to the numbers of bats hunted on Niue, they determined current hunting rates were unsustainable. Epstein et al. (2009) estimated potential harvest rates of P. vampyrus in Malaysia as a function of the number of hunting licenses issued. Incorporating these hunting mortality rates into their estimated bat population growth matrix, they projected declines in the Malaysian bat population using even the most conservative measures of hunting pressure. On Madagascar, Goodman (2006) extrapolated total hunting pressure on hipposiderids from a single hunter he interviewed. Comparing this estimated mortality rate to the local bat population surveyed, he then inferred hunting levels were detrimental, because take exceeded the breeding potential of the local bat populations. Caveats. Rarely will information be available on harvest levels, population sizes, and reproductive rates for the same bat species. The studies described here work around missing information by using indices of bat harvest levels (e.g. licenses), estimates of reproduction rates from better known congenerics, and models of sustainable take based on rules of thumb from other harvested species (e.g. âRRâ production method, named after its authors, Robinson and Redford 1991). When indices, estimates, and models based on other species are used, there are caveats to consider. Researchers should be sure that the relationship between the index and the measure of interest is known and does not vary. Estimates based on similar species may differ from the species of interest. With population growth rates in particular, ignoring density-dependent factors could lead to inaccurate estimates of reproduction and population growth capability. Finally, models for determining sustainable hunting rates, such as the RR method used by Brooke and Tschapka (2002), predict a sustainable take rate of 40 % of the annual growth for species with life spans the length of fruit bats. However, this rate is based on similar species with potentially different life histories and may not take into account the other stressors that bats face today."

In general, management is required wherever human activities negatively impact ï¬sh habitats or where commercial and/or recreational ï¬sheries use stocks in an unsustainable way. Next to those impacts the reestablishment of formerly endangered piscivorous predators (e.g., cormorants, otters), the spreading of invasive ï¬sh species (some of them introduced by ï¬shermen), or the consequences of global change comprise further interferences that can cause substantial problems for natural ï¬sh stocks. The probability that such problems combine or overlap is very likely in Europe, severely complicating the challenge of managing ï¬sheries sustainably. In the end, all potential problems of wild ï¬sh stocks are related to human activities. Therefore, the need to manage ï¬sh, ultimately, is always associated with human inï¬uences, attitudes, behavior, and expectations. Modern ï¬sheries management in waters dedicated primarily to recreational ï¬shing must try to merge nature conservation needs and the satisfaction of a still-growing number of anglers. The majority of Austrian running water bodies can be assigned to the rhithral and are predominantly colonized by brown trout (Salmo trutta) and other salmonid species, like the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and the Danube salmon (Hucho hucho). Similar to other Central European countries, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which was ï¬rst brought to Austria in 1886 (MacCrimmon 1971) and successfully established self-sustaining populations, evolved rapidly as a target species for recreational ï¬shing. Additionally, many anglers ï¬sh in natural lakes as well as other stagnant water bodies like artiï¬cial ponds, reservoirs, and ï¬oodplain oxbows, targeting a broader diversity of ï¬sh species.

Direct economic impacts faced by the sector arise from the need to repair or replace gear that has been damaged or lost due to encounters with marine litter; repairing vessels with tangled propellers (Fig. 14.1), anchors, rudders, blocked intake pipes, etc.; loss of earnings due to time diverted to deal with marine litter encounters; and loss of earnings from reduced or contaminated catches resulting from marine litter encounters including ghost fishing"

Age plays a significant role in pinnipeds, as younger seals are more often entangled than adults (Lucas 1992; Henderson 2001; Hofmeyr et al. 2006). Gannets and many other seabird species use seaweed to build their nests, but are known to frequently incorporate ropes, nets and other anthropogenic debris (Podolski and Kress 1989; Montevecchi 1991; Hartwig et al. 2007; Votier et al. 2011; Bond et al. 2012; Lavers et al. 2013; Verlis et al. 2014) (Fig. 4.1). Marine debris used in nest construction increases the risk of mortal entanglement for both adult birds and chicks (Fig. 4.1). In three of the six North American gannet populations, close to 75 % of the gannet nests contained fishing debris. Its frequency can be linked to the level of gillnet fishing effort in the waters around the colonies (Bond et al. 2012)."

Large numbers of leatherback sea turtles are captured each year in the Gulf as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. Hawksbills are the rarest of the five species of sea turtle that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and their current abundance is only a fraction of historical levels because millions were killed for tortoiseshell (jewelry, combs, brushes, buttons, etc.) during the past 100 years. Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal. In summary, because sea turtles are difficult to study and since some species have been studied more than others, there are significant gaps in the data available by species, as well as by life stage.

218,0,0.384,Sustainable Development in The Jordan Valley : Final Report of The Regional Ngo Master Plan,"A peer-reviewed multidisciplinary Series of Reference Books and Monographs This book series includes monographs and edited volumes that cross scientiï¬c disciplines and develop common ground among scientists from the natural and social sciences, as well as from North and South, addressing common challenges and risks for humankind in the 21st century. The âhexagonâ represents six key factors contributing to global environmental changeâ three nature-induced or supply factors: soil, water and air (atmosphere and climate), and three human-induced or demand factors: population (growth), urban systems (habitat, pollution) and rural systems (agriculture, food). Throughout the history of the earth and of Homo sapiens these six factors have interacted. The supply factors have created the preconditions for life while human behavior and economic consumption patterns have also contributed to its challenges (increase in extreme weather events) and fatal outcomes for human beings and society. The series covers the complex interactions among these six factors and their often extreme and in a few cases fatal outcomes (hazards/disasters, internal displacement and migrations, crises and conflicts), as well as crucial social science concepts relevant for their analysis. Further issues related to three basic areas of research: approaches and schools of environment, security, and peace, especially in the environmental security realm and from a human security perspective, will be addressed. The goal of this book series is to contribute to a fourth phase of research on environmental security from a normative peace research and/or human security perspective. In this series, the editor welcomes books by natural and social scientists, as well as by multidisciplinary teams of authors. The material should address issues of global change (including climate change, desertiï¬cation, deforestation), and its impacts on humankind (natural hazards and disasters), on environmentally-induced migration, on crises and conflicts, as well as for cooperative strategies to cope with these challenges either locally or in the framework of international organizations and regimes. From a human-centered perspective, this book series offers a platform for scientiï¬c communities dealing with global environmental and climate change, disaster reduction, human, environmental and gender security, peace and conflict research, as well as for the humanitarian aid and the policy community in national governments and international organizations. The series editor welcomes brief concept outlines and original manuscripts as proposals. If they are considered of relevance, these proposals will be peer-reviewed by specialists in the ï¬eld from the natural and the social sciences. Inclusion in this series will also require a positive decision by the publisherâs international editorial conference. Prior to publication, the manuscripts will be assessed by the series editor and external peer reviewers."

Sediment trapping is a related function most often attributed to riverine forests (e.g., the Shark River in the Everglades, Florida) (Ewel et al. 1998), but the scrub mangrove habitats found in the Mississippi River Delta along secondary waterways may also capture sediment (Perry and Mendelssohn 2009).

In many countries, populations at risk of exposure, such as bat hunters, butchers, consumers, or guano harvesters, have very low rates of risk perception (Harrison et al. 2011; Robertson et al. 2011; Kamins et al. 2014). Educational interventions are needed to reduce target behaviors that increase transmission probabilities, but the challenge from a conservation perspective is to do so without engendering an overall negative attitude toward bats or calls for destruction of populations. Education materials that simultaneously target behaviors and highlight bat ecosystem services are a start (see Appendix 3 of Kamins et al. 2014), but it is unclear how effective these approaches are, and further research on such âmixed messagesâ is much needed."

This may entail several consequences. As for other organism groups, the risk to drift following hydropeaking is taxa-speciï¬c: postemergence brown trout (Salmo trutta) prefer substrate-linked habitats, making them more resistant to drift caused by hydropeaking compared to larval grayling (Thymallus thymallus), which start to swim relatively soon within the water column (Auer et al. 2014). Experiments conducted by Schmutz et al. (2013) found a positive relationship between maximum peak ï¬ows and drift rates of juvenile graylings. Interestingly, a survey by Thompson et al. (2011) showed that repeated peak events may increase the chances of successful adaptive responses to hydropeaking. Auer et al. (2014) found a decrease of hydropeaking-induced drift during repeated peak events for juvenile graylings. Reaching certain thresholds of critical ï¬ow can additionally induce bed movement and thus suppress periphyton as well as macroinvertebrate biomass through increased drift (Townsend et al. 1997; Biggs and Close 1989; Graf et al. 2013). Further, temporary increases of suspended solid concentration in the water column during peaks followed by ï¬ne sediment accumulations between peaks may be another factor depressing periphyton growth. Yamada and Nakamura (2002) observed an inverse correlation between suspended solid concentration and benthic chlorophyll-a concentrations in autumn and winter, which they related to shading effects. However, the amount of the ï¬ne sediment load is also an important factor. For example, small deposits of ï¬ne sediment on coarse substrata increase habitat heterogeneity, augmenting taxa more tolerant to the movement of ï¬ne particles. However, ï¬ne particles can crush and bury cells of benthic algae and cyanobacteria (Burkholder 1996) and, hence, potentially also increase taxon richness and evenness via reduced competition with taxa that are strong competitors on a stable substratum (Wagenhoff et al. 2013). During phases of substrate stability (between two hydropeaking events), the importance of invertebrate grazers and, thus, biotic control on periphyton recovery increases (Biggs and Close 1989). Besides periphyton and macroinvertebrates, high shear stress and gravel bed movement can also affect ï¬sh communities, e.g., larval brown trout are highly vulnerable due to the preferences for substrate-linked habitats."

Interestingly, their cross-correlation analyses suggest the propagation of a climate signal from SST through decapod larvae, adult crabs and lesser black-backed gulls with lags that match the biology of each trophic group. This is indicative of climate-induced changes in the marine fauna extending to the avian fauna, and thus to the terrestrial food web around the seabird colonies (Luczak et al. 2012). Case Study 5: Vulnerability of the seabird community in the western North Sea to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Most seabird studies have tended to consider the impacts of single stressors on single species at speciï¬c times of the year, and so may be unrepresentative of the combined effects of pressures experienced by top predator communities over an annual cycle (Burthe et al. 2014). For marine top predators, there is evidence to suggest that interactions between climate and other threats may be additive (Frederiksen et al. 2004b; Burthe et al. 2014). Burthe et al. (2014) studied the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a community of seabirds in the North Sea. More precisely, they examined vulnerability to climate change and other anthropogenic threats in a seabird community (45 species; 11 families) that used the Forth and Tay region (eastern Scotland) of the North Sea for breeding, overwintering or migration between 1980 and 2011. They found only 13 % of the seabird community in the Forth and Tay region to fall within the categories of low or very low population concern to future warming, whereas in considering multiple anthropogenic threats 73 % of the species in this bird community were considered to be of high or very high population concern for the future (Burthe et al. 2014). Case Study 6: Effects of extreme climatic events on coastal birds breeding in low-lying saltmarshes (for a more extensive review see Chap. 9). Van de Pol et al. (2010) investigated whether the frequency, magnitude and timing of rare but catastrophic flooding events have changed over time in Europeâs largest estuary, the Wadden Sea. They subsequently quantiï¬ed how this had affected the flooding risk of six saltmarsh nesting bird species (both seabird species and coastal species). Maximum high tide has increased twice as fast as mean high tide over the past four decades, resulting in more frequent and more catastrophic flooding of nests, especially around the time when most eggs have just hatched. By using data on speciesâ nest elevations, on the timing of egg-laying and on the length of time that the eggs and chicks are at risk from flooding, van de Pol et al. (2010) showed that flood risk increased for all six species (even after accounting for compensatory land accretion) and that this could worsen in the near future if the species do not adapt. This study provides the ï¬rst evidence that increasing flooding risks have reduced the reproductive output below stable population levels in at least one species, the Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus.

246,174,0.379,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Land abandonment is widespread in many European areas with poor agricultural development. In the face of this situation, the rewilding of abandoned landscapes (defined as the passive management of ecological succession, see Chap. 1; Fig. 5.7) is viewed as an opportunity to recover native biodiversity and ecological processes and provide a range of ecosystem services (Cramer et al. 2008; and see Chaps. 1, 3). In contrast, active management is aimed at the maintenance of low-intensity agriculture in order to conserve specific organisms and particular habitats, often working against succession processes (e.g. Pain and Pienkowski 1997). This dichotomy is subject to a heated debate with clear implications for European agricultural policies (see details in Merckx and Pereira in press). Within this scenario, the conservation of top scavengers, not only as charismatic species but also as key actors in complex ecological processes, imposes particular challenges. Vultures, as well as a panoply of facultative predatory-scavenger vertebrates, arthropods, and microorganisms, depend largely on the existence of ungulate and medium-size vertebrate carcasses, a"
230,441,0.379,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.3.1.5 Marine Mammals Only one study on microplastic ingestion by marine mammals has been published to date. Bravo Rebolledo et al. (2013) recorded microplastics in stomachs (11 %, n = 100) and intestines (1 %, n = 107) of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). Direct microplastic ingestion by other species of marine mammals has not been observed. However, larger plastics items were identified in the stomachs of numerous cetaceans (46 % of all species; Baulch and Perry 2014, see also KÃ¼hn et al. 2015). The frequency of microplastic uptake by marine mammals is hitherto unknown, but could occur through filter feeding, inhalation at the water-air interface, or via trophic transfer from prey items. As baleen whales (Mysticetes) strain water between baleen plates, to trap planktonic organisms and small fish (Nemoto 1970), they may incidentally trap microplastics. Thus, their feeding mode may render baleen whales more susceptible to direct microplastic ingestion than toothed (Odotocetes) or beaked whales (Ziphiids) which are active predators of squid and fish (Pauly et al. 1998). It is also likely that marine mammals are exposed to microplastic via trophic transfer from prey species. For example, microplastics were recorded from the scats of fur seals (Arctocephalus spp.) believed to originate from lantern fish (Electrona subaspera) (Eriksson and Burton 2003). Cetaceans were suggested as sentinels for microplastic pollution (Fossi et al. 2012a; Galgani et al. 2014). However, it is notoriously difficult to extract and subsequently assess microplastics from cetacean stomachs, the often large size and decomposition rate of stomachs make sampling almost impossible. Furthermore, strandings are infrequent and unpredictable. Although adaption of sampling methods for smaller organisms such as fish and birds have the potential to be implemented, further work is necessary. The assessment of phthalate concentrations in the blubber of stranded fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) (Fossi et al. 2012b, 2014) could serve as an indicator for the uptake of microplastics, but this raises other concerns as it is not possible to distinguish the origin of the phthalates. Exposure routes could be via micro- or macroplastics or simply from direct uptake of chemicals from the surrounding seawater into the blubber. Further work is essential to assess if microplastics significantly affect marine mammals."

231,951,0.378,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Weather variables such as air and sea temperature, and amounts of precipitation are changing. Intra- and interannual variability in these weather variables, temporal autocorrelation and the frequency of extreme events can also change over time, which may all affect population dynamics of coastal birds (Van de Pol et al. 2010a, b, 2011). However, climate may not change at the same rate throughout the year or in different parts of the world, and this can lead to phenological mismatches in food webs (Visser 2008) and require readjustment of migration schedules (Bauer et al. 2008). Global warming is causing both air and water temperatures to rise. Air temperatures directly affect the energetic expenditure and thereby food requirements of birds, particularly in small species during winter (Kersten and Piersma 1987). Many benthic and ï¬sh species that are prey items of coastal birds are strongly dependent on sea temperatures for growth, reproduction and survival (see also Chap. 8, Sect. 8.4). Severe winters can cause high mortality among many invertebrates, but these same cold winters can also cause shellï¬sh to lose less body mass (Honkoop and Beukema 1997) and result in a good spatfall (Beukema 1992). Thus, it has been suggested that global warming is already"
151,272,0.377,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"more relevant to the field. Results for cosms thus provided another line of evidence for characterization of the risks of CPY under conditions that are more representative of conditions in the field. Risks to aquatic organisms from measured exposures were assessed by comparing the 95th centile concentrations to the HC5s for the SSDs. These data may not fully capture peak exposures but suggested that there were de minimis risks for all aquatic organisms from exposures measured after use patterns were changed in 2001. The analyses also showed that risks had decreased from those prior to 2001, which leads to the conclusion that the changes made in 2001 and 2005 to the labeled use patterns, and possibly other changes in general pesticide stewardship, mitigated CPY exposures and reduced risks. Estimated exposures from models for three focus-scenarios, representing greater vulnerability to exposures than other use scenarios (Williams et al. 2014), allowed the assessment of risks based on 96-h time-weighted-mean concentrations that were matched to the 48â96 h toxicity data. Based on the joint probabilities of distributions of data for exposure and toxicity, we concluded that risks for fish and aquatic stages of insects were de minimis in all three regions. However, in the intensive-use scenario of Orestimba Creek, in California, risk to crustaceans was greater and deemed to be not de minimis. Further analysis of risks from repeated exposures to CPY, in these three focus-scenarios, confirmed the de minimis risks to crustaceans, insects, and fish in the focus-scenarios in GA and MI. Repeated exposures in Orestimba Creek, CA suggested small risks to fish, insects, and crustaceans. We concluded that repeated exposures to insects and crustaceans would not be ecologically relevant because of the potential for rapid recovery in these taxa. Risks for fish may be somewhat greater because there is more uncertainty regarding recovery of the target enzyme AChE and because of their longer reproductive cycles. The lack of fish-kills since 2002 in the U.S. that were associated with confirmed exposure to CPY is consistent with the small risks to fish and the smaller exposures in surface waters since the change in the labeled uses. Too few data on toxicity of CPYO were available to conduct a probabilistic risk assessment but, on the basis of the available data and the large margins of exposure, we concluded that risks of CPYO to aquatic organisms were de minimis. CPYO is the active metabolite of CPY, and its toxicity is subsumed by the parent CPY. It is thus not surprising that CPYOâs toxicity is similar to that of CPY. CPYO is more rapidly hydrolyzed in water and is more polar than CPY and is less likely to be taken up into aquatic organisms. Detections of CPYO in surface waters were infrequent, and the concentrations were all less than toxicologically significant values for the one fish and one invertebrate for which data were available. This ERA was supported by several strong data-sets. There is a good database of toxicity values for CPY, and many of these tests are of high quality. They are certainly sufficient to characterize acute toxicity to insects, crustaceans, and fish. There are also large sets of data for measured values in surface waters in a number of locations, including areas of intensive use, where greater exposures would be expected. Several studies conducted in cosms, some of excellent quality, are available to provide points of reference for the SSDs and information on recovery of invertebrates"

246,118,0.376,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Large mammals are often regarded as flagship species of wild areas and the paradigm of wilderness untouched by, or at least relatively separated from, human activities (Ray et al. 2005). This is especially true for large carnivores. This view largely stems from the historic processes of direct human persecution and indirect habitat change that gradually reduced their presence in human-dominated landscapes such that they only persisted in the residual areas with little or no human activity. As a consequence, the view of large carnivores as beasts of the wilderness became consolidated, particularly in North America (Boitani 1995). Since Europe is home to more than 500 million people and lacks extensive pristine, uninhabited land areas and large protected areas with spectacular aggregations of large mammals, it might appear to have little to offer for large carnivore conservation. However, nothing could be further from the truth. In the last few decades, changes in the socio-economic settings and peopleâs values concerning nature and biodiversity have paved the way for new opportunities for large carnivores. As the situation develops a new conservation paradigm is slowly emerging based on the premises of coexistence instead of exclusion. In this essay, we firstly describe the current status and trends of the large carnivores in Europe and examine the main causes of the recent increase in numbers and range. Second, we discuss the available opportunities to sustain the positive trends and the challenges in driving the process toward a new balance between carnivores and human activities. Thirdly, we use the insights coming from large carnivore conservation to offer our views on the social and ecological implications of managing the ârewildingâ of Europe. In Europe, five carnivore species have been traditionally considered as âlarge carnivoresâ, but in this essay we will focus on the three most important ones, the grey wolf ( Canis lupus), the bear ( Ursus arctos) and the Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx); the other two, the Iberian lynx ( Lynx pardina) and the wolverine ( Gulo gulo) are restricted to small areas, respectively in southern Iberia and northern Fennoscandia, and are associated with very specific management issues."

260,11,0.376,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"the anthropogenic translocation of sublethally infected salamanders over large geographic distances (Storfer et al. 2007; Picco and Collins 2008). Thomas Waltzek at the University of Florida is currently sequencing the entire genomes of dozens of ranaviruses from around the globe, which will enable him to look at phylogeographic patterns, and identify areas of recent introductions. In general, pathogens emerge in populations either because they are novel or due to an increase in environmental stressors that decrease host immune function. As described above, there is support for the first hypothesis, and it is likely a consequence of pathogen pollution (i.e., the human movement of infected animals or contaminated fomites over large geographic distances, Cunningham et al. 2003). Furthermore, although research is limited, there is evidence that insecticides, herbicides, and the use of wetlands by cattle can act as stressors and increase the chance of ranavirus emergence (Forson and Storfer 2006; Gray et al. 2007; Kerby et al. 2011). In the past 4 years, >90 % of the cases of ranavirus infection and disease have been reported (Duffus et al. 2015). While enhanced awareness of ranaviruses and increased sampling efforts probably contributes to increased detections, it is unlikely that these factors are solely responsible. In this contribution, we provide a comprehensive and current review of ranavirus taxonomy (Jancovich et al. 2015a), virus distribution (Duffus et al. 2015), hostpathogen ecology and evolution (Brunner et al. 2015), viral replication strategies (Jancovich et al. 2015b), host antiviral immunity and viral countermeasures (Grayfer et al. 2015), ranavirus pathology and diagnosis (Miller et al. 2015), and suggestions for the design and analysis of ranavirus studies (Gray et al. 2015). Collectively, this work provides an up-to-date overview of ranaviruses and their impacts on host organisms, and reflects the contributions of investigators (i.e., molecular virologists, immunologists, ecologists, veterinary pathologists, population biologists) possessing diverse skills, but united in their interest in ranaviruses and the diseases they cause. In addition to this book, professionals around the globe have been working together to learn about ranaviruses. For example, two international symposia devoted to ranaviruses (Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2011; Knoxville, Tennessee, 2013) brought together scientists interested in understanding ranaviruses and their disease potential (LesbarrÃ¨res et al. 2012; Duffus et al. 2014). A third symposium is planned for Gainesville, Florida, USA in 2015. Between the 2011 and 2013 symposia, investigators interested in ranaviruses founded the Global Ranavirus Consortium (GRC). The goal of the GRC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among scientists and veterinarians conducting research on ranaviruses and diagnosing cases of ranaviral disease. Specifically, the GRC aims to: (1) advance knowledge in all areas of ranavirus biology and disease, (2) facilitate multidisciplinary, scientific collaborations, (3) disseminate information on ranaviruses, and (4) provide expert guidance and training opportunities. The GRC accomplishes these goals by hosting a biennial symposium, organizing regional workshops and discussion groups, and maintaining a website (http://ranavirus.org) with various resources including a current list of ranavirus publications and laboratories that test for the pathogen. They also are leading an effort to create a Global Ranavirus Reporting System, which will be an online data management system that allows cases of ranavirus infection and disease"
222,607,0.376,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This SES takes into account the people living directly adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest. People fish on its margins and interior, and enter on a daily or weekly basis to collect firewood, honey, fish, crabs, and thatching among other resources. The Sundarbans is a nature reserve so people are prohibited from living within its boundaries. Households therefore live on its border among the brackish water shrimp ponds. Three themes emerged from the interviews with mangrove collectors: (i) highly seasonal incomes, (ii) high levels of livelihood and personal insecurity, and (iii) systems of permits that are difficult to navigate and/or ineffective. Interviews with these natural resource users revealed livelihoods highly affected by seasonality. Wet season rains make collection of firewood difficult (9); in the dry season there is a scarcity of freshwater and people have to drink salty water (9); fishermen fish in different locations in different seasons (8, 14); resource collection is banned during certain periods (68); and the quality of resources (e.g. the size of crabs) changes with the season (11). Some respondents move between different resource and day labour opportunities, while others exhibit extremely low livelihood mobility due to a strong livelihood-based identity (e.g. traditional fishermen), or a lack of human capital. For example, despite collection of firewood being prohibited, a woman of around 50 still went into the forest every day. In doing so, she faced the threat of both being detected and physical punished by forest guards as well as exposure to extreme weather and natural hazards (9). This theme of insecurity commonly arose in interviews. Not just in terms of a stable income source but also in terms of the potential of physical harm from encounters with pirates, forest guards or wild animals, physically demanding working conditions, and the periodic threat of"

255,54,0.375,Railway Ecology,"Hels and Buchwald 2001; Carvalho and Mira 2011), records for railways are much rarer (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998). Unfortunately, there are no studies that compare detectability and persistence rates of carcasses between road and railway surveys, so the difference in numbers remains an open question. Considering only the studies that aimed to survey train casualties of all species, the frequency of amphibians can reach up to 47% of all vertebrate records (Heske 2015), while the records of reptiles represent ca. 4% (Spain) and 6% (USA) of carcasses (Heske 2015; SCV 1996). In Netherlands, for example, no carcasses of amphibians or reptiles were ever found (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998), while in Spain, only reptiles were recorded (SCV 1996). In Chicago state, USA, amphibians were the most abundant taxonomic group recorded in train collisions (Heske 2015), mainly northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and American toads (Bufo americanus), common species in the region. Mortalities of amphibians were particularly high after rain events, when these species are most active and are also frequently found dead on the roads (Heske 2015). Budzic and Budzic (2014) conducted a survey speciï¬cally aimed to estimate amphibian mortality on 34 km of Polish railways. They found that three species were most affected by train accidents: the common toad (Bufo bufo), the common frog (Rana temporaria) and the green frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus), and most of dead individuals (77%) were adult common toads. Although mortality rates can be high, all three species are considered common in Europe. In fact, two of the species affected by railway mortality (common toad and common frog), are among the most common European amphibians, for which there is also evidence of high road-mortality (Hels and Buchwald 2001; Matos et al. 2012; OrÅowski 2007). As in roads, the spring migration (or autumn migration, in some regions) seems to be the period of highest amphibian mortality on railway tracks, as 87% of all accidents occurred in that season (Budzic and Budzic 2014). Yet, railway mortality of amphibians seems to depend on animalsâ physical features (such as body size and limb length) and should be associated with the agility of the species (Budzic and Budzic 2014). While in the case of roads, the velocity of individuals is used as a proxy for agility (Hels and Buchwald 2001), in the case of railway tracks, agility relates mainly to the ability to overcome obstacles (Budzic and Budzic 2014; SCV 1996). Due to its physical features, the common toad was more likely to become trapped between rails, indicating that this species (and others with similar physical features) may be more vulnerable to railway mortality (Budzic and Budzic 2014). Some species of small size may be less vulnerable because they cannot cross the rail track (Heske 2015). However, they may be affected by railways at the level of gene flow due to barrier effects (Holderegger and Di Giulio 2010), which may be also a conservation problem. Concerning reptile mortality, 13 snakes (4%) were recorded across the whole Spanish railway network between 1990 and 1995. Only two species were identiï¬ed: the ladder snake (Elaphe scalaris) and the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), both common reptiles in the country (SCV 1996).

Many more birds were recorded in autumn (47.3%) and winter (22.0%), than in spring (11.9%) and summer (18.8%). This pattern of seasonal occurrence was also observed for the most abundant species, except in the case of flamingos, which were mainly recorded in winter and spring, and godwits, which peaked in autumn and summer. The distribution of birds was highly concentrated, with about 76% of individuals counted on just eight of the 22 plots surveyed. Many more birds were counted in the tanks of salt pans (64.5%), than in either rice ï¬elds (27.2%) or intertidal areas (8.4%). This pattern was also found for most individual species, although there were also several species with peak counts (>75% of observations) in rice ï¬elds (e.g. cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, purple heron, white stork Ciconia ciconia, black stork C. nigra, glossy ibis Plegadis falcinellus, and lapwing Vanellus vanellus). Only a few species were most counted (>50%) in intertidal areas, including mallard A. platyrhynchos, grey plover Pluvialis squatarola, common sandpiper Actitis hypoleucos, and whimbrel Numenius phaeopus."

376,668,0.375,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","brucellosis in red deer (Cervus elaphus) declined as a result of control efforts in livestock (Serrano et al. 2011). In these cases the wildlife populations were not competent disease reservoirs, failing to sustain the infection without co-circulation through livestock. In cases where wildlife populations are competent reservoir hosts, control efforts are complicated by social, logistical, and ecological factors (e.g., Donnelly et al. 2006). Culling and increased hunting of wildlife are often proposed to control wildlife diseases but they are seldom effective. First, it might be difficult to achieve the necessary hunter participation to create large reductions in host density (e.g., Heberlein 2004). Many hunters will want to maintain high densities to maximize their future hunting opportunities. Second, the cost of culling wildlife, particularly in a test and cull strategy, can be very high and so is only applicable to localized operations (Wolfe et al. 2004). One of the rationales for culling wildlife is that disease transmission might be positively correlated with host density (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). Although plausible, this assumption is not always supported by data and even if transmission is density-dependent, culling can have adverse consequences. For example, culling badgers (Meles meles) to control bovine tuberculosis in Britain causes the disease to spread even further due to social disruption, with surviving badgers roaming more widely to find mates (Bielby et al. 2014). In addition, increased hunting in regions of easy access might locally aggregate wildlife in areas of limited hunter access even if the regional density declines. Part of the problem, at least for diseases that can be transmitted back and forth between livestock and wildlife, is that disease control measures used on wildlife are based on those developed for livestock. Therein lies a mismatch in spatial scale, because livestock can be intensively managed within fences at the ranch scale but wildlife populations are free-ranging at the landscape scale (Bienen and Tabor 2006). There is also a mismatch in temporal scale because disease eradication campaigns are typically continuous for livestock but in wildlife they can be tactically scheduled to take advantage of episodic natural disturbances. For example, in the Kruger ecosystem of South Africa, buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in herds with a higher prevalence of bovine tuberculosis lose condition faster during dry seasons (Caron et al. 2003). It follows that any attempts to minimize the disease in the buffalo population should be reserved for immediately after droughts, which occur about once per decade. That is when die-offs of 50 % or more leave a smaller population size to contend with, and presumably a much reduced proportion of infected animals (du Toit 2010). For rangelands in particular, progress in reducingâor at least accommodatingâthe risks of wildlife-borne diseases to livestock will depend upon the better integration of veterinary practice and epidemiology with disease ecology. As a case in point, before brucellosis was virtually eradicated in cattle in the USA it was transmitted to elk (Cervus canadensis) and bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area, where it has repeatedly been transmitted back to cattle from elk (Rhyan et al. 2013). Free-ranging elk are now increasing in the area in which brucellosis is endemic and so the veterinary achievements in fighting the disease in livestock over the past 75 years must now be followed by ecologically based adaptive"

While authors award animals key roles as transmitters of infectious diseases, they also present them as charismatic wildlife that need to be protected from disease; or, in the case of livestock animals, as potential food for humans whose productivity (like that of the cows discussed in Chapter 4) must be safeguarded and promoted. While the WCS veterinariansâ ultimate priority was (in line with their institutional orientation) the protection and preservation of wildlife, the version of OH that they fashioned argues that this is best pursued through means that jointly protect human, animal and ecological health, for the benefit of all species. While drawing heavily on older ideas about OM, by broadening the scope from medicine to health, and bringing in the idea of care for ecosystems and wildlife alongside livestock and humans, it decentred humans significantly. 6.1.3"

302,371,0.374,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"1 The Social-Ecological Risk Perspective: Addressing Global Risks A common risk definition is that âthe term âriskâ denotes the likelihood that an undesirable state of reality (adverse effects) may occur as a result of natural events or human activitiesâ [1]. A classical risk analysis calculates the possibility of an adverse event and the potential damage, for instance, an assessment of ecotoxicity of hazardous substances based on dose-response relationships. For âglobal risks,â also termed systemic risks, classical risk analysis is not so easily applicable, since the characteristics of âglobal risksâ comprise complex cause-effect linkages, which are not fully known, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in assessing the risk. For this reason, consent to risk management strategies is difficult to obtain [2, 3]. Who or what can be âat riskâ? In social-ecological risk research, risks to humans and biophysical entities (e.g., biocoenoses, ecosystems) are considered. The causes of risks mostly lie in human activities, since many natural resources and biophysical processes are influenced by societies [4]. In social-ecological risk research, it has become clear that assessment of the risk alone is not sufficient for management and policy decisions [5]. It is also important to consider the risk perception and concerns of different interest groups [6]. In the case of complex risks which are accompanied by uncertainty, it is important to define the degree of tolerability and acceptability in order to find management strategies acceptable to all interest groups [7]. Therefore, a prerequisite for risk management and related policy-making is not only scientific evidence but also an agreement of the different interest groups on how to understand, interpret, and value the evidence. Hereafter, we will outline the characteristics of global risks from a socialecological perspective and present four arguments framing microplastics as a global risk. (a) Global risks are not produced by an extreme event or a disaster but are created in modern societies as a side effect of an âeveryday modeâ of systemâs operation [8, 9] and regulation of the supply system [4]. From this understanding, we derive our first thesis, arguing that the risks of microplastics are produced as an unintended side effect of everyday operations in modern societies. (b) Global risks are complex; thus, no clear evidence of a cause-effect linkage exists or can be proven, due to âintervening variables,â âlong delay periods between cause and effect,â or âpositive and negative feedback loopsâ [10]. These and the state of ânot knowingâ [8] contribute to a high degree of uncertainty regarding effects, especially in terms of scope and time. Thus, we"

230,610,0.374,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.5 Conclusions Marine litter is a complex problem to address, which exerts significant economic costs, often borne not by the polluter but by coastal and marine industries such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, etc. (some of which also contribute significantly to marine litter). Economic instruments have a potentially important role to play in addressing marine litter, with initiatives in place in several countries proving that they can lead to significant reductions in waste entering the environment (ten Brink et al. 2009). The development of effective and efficient instruments requires a strong link between the behavior change driven by the instrument and the harm caused by marine litter. However, there are several areas where there is a lack of sufficient information to make this link. At the heart of this is the problem of understanding the harm caused by marine litter. The harm caused by some forms of litter is known, however, there are large gaps in this understanding. While the presence of litter in the marine environment and even its ingestion, etc., in species is documented, it is not clear what impact it is having on critical populations of marine organisms or indeed species higher up the food chain (including humans). Further, while some specific types of litter are identified as having some impacts (discarded nets, plastic bags, etc.), the impacts of other types of litter are currently poorly understood, which is most notable with the debate on micro- and nanoplastics. In relation to socio-economic impacts, impacts on tourism from beach litter are documented, but a quantitative link between the impact and levels of litter is poorly understood (Ballance et al. 2000). These links between types, quantities and sources of marine litter and their varied impacts are important to understand if targeted economic instruments are to be developed. Otherwise an instrument may lead to a reduction in litter, but with a limited reduction in impact."

255,424,0.373,Railway Ecology,"(WTC) (e.g. Becker and Grauvogel 1991; Jaren et al. 1991; Muzzi and Bisset 1990). The ï¬rst known study in the Czech Republic dealing with the influence of railways on animals was the study by HavlÃ­n (1987), which focused on animal mortality caused by railways in the agrarian landscape. A 314-km long railway line in the South Moravia Region was studied between 1981 and 1986. In that period, 91 birds (19 species) and 149 mammals (11 species) were killed. The most common species were European hare (Lepus europaeus) and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). Another well-known study in the Czech Republic was carried out on the track between TrhovÃ½ Å tÄpÃ¡nov and BeneÅ¡ov u Prahy (JankovskÃ½ and Äech 2001). The track is 33 km long and it crosses many very different habitats and therefore enables a more comprehensive view of the impacts of railways. The ï¬rst research on this track was carried out in the winter of 1999â2000. The research was based on ï¬eld trips and analysis of skeletal ï¬ndings of animals killed by train. The results show that Leporidae were hit in 32% of cases, Even-toed ungulates in 22% [in the vast majority of cases, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)], Carnivora in 18%, Birds in 10%, Insectivora in 4% and Reptiles in 2%. The ï¬ndings of physical remnants were tied to those sections where the track does not form a signiï¬cant barrier height, whether by an embankment or a cutting. At areas signiï¬cantly banked and often vegetated by shrubs, many pheasant carcasses were found. In May 2006, repeated research was carried out on the track between TrhovÃ½ Å tÄpÃ¡nov and BeneÅ¡ov u Prahy which, among other ï¬ndings, found an increase in the mortality of roe deer (JankovskÃ½ and Äech 2008). KuÅ¡ta et al. (2014b) published the results of the monitoring of roe deer deaths in 2009 on four train tracks (regional as well as local): (1) PlzeÅâHoraÅ¾Äovice; (2) BÄlÄiceâZÃ¡viÅ¡Ã­n; (3) ObrataÅâJindÅichÅ¯v Hradec; (4) DobrÃ¡ Voda u PelhÅimovaâHÅÃ­bÄcÃ­. The research showed that collisions of trains with roe deer occur most frequently in winter. The results of this study show that when evaluating animal mortality the speciï¬c context should be taken into account (location, climatic conditions, animal abundance in the location, its biology and ethology, railway transport intensity, etc.). For example, on the monitored track DobrÃ¡ Voda u PelhÅimovaâHÅÃ­bÄcÃ­, collisions with roe deer occurred most often in summer months, while on the track JedlovÃ¡âChÅibskÃ¡ in winter months. Both tracks lie at approximately the same altitude (650 m a.s.l.) and about the same number of trains use them weekly (132 and 197). Interestingly, railway accidents most often occur in winter, while accidents on roads occur less frequently in winter (Hothorn et al. 2012; KuÅ¡ta et al. 2014a; KuÅ¡ta et al. 2017; PokornÃ½ 2006). Therefore railway transport can influence animal behaviour in a different way than road transport. It is necessary to look for the reasons why accidents happen so often in this season. In the Czech Republic it may be due to the attractive food availability, which is in the immediate vicinity of the tracks in the winter (wild raspberry bushes, etc.). This explanation is also supported in other studies (Bowman et al. 2010; Rea et al. 2010; Marchand 1996). In the"
151,392,0.373,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"linkages to assessment endpoints are lacking (Alix and Lewis 2010; Fischer and Moriarty 2011). Given the limited number of such studies that were found and the high degree of variability in methods among these studies, chronic laboratory studies were not used in this risk assessment. Since the focus of this risk assessment was on endpoints and assessment measures related to survival, development, reproduction, and colony strength, studies that examined effects of CPY on pollinators using endpoints such as oxidative stress (Shafiq ur 2009) and localized cell death (Gregoric and Ellis 2011) were not included. Available higher-tier semi-field and field-tests provide data on mortality, foraging behavior, brood development, and overall vigor. These should receive greater weight than the results of sublethal testing because the net effect of multiple stressors and modes of action are integrated into these higher-tier tests (Thompson and Maus 2007). Semi-field and field tests were an important line of evidence in this risk assessment. The analysis conducted here consisted of four parts recommended by the USEPA Risk Assessment Framework (Fischer and Moriarty 2011; USEPA 1998, 2012): (1) characterization of the stressor; (2) characterization of potential exposures by various pathways; (3) characterization of effects in pollinator or surrogate species; and (4) risk characterization."

If the yearly catches are smaller than the surplus production, the stock can be maintained at a high level. But if the resources approach the carrying capacity, the surplus production decreases, and this is not effective utilization. If, on the other hand, the catch amount is larger than the MSY, the stock decreases until extinction. Catch at the MSY seems to be desirable from the viewpoint of sustainability, but fishery operators rarely know the true MSY level. Consequently, fishing is continued at a higher rate than the MSY, thus endangering many fish species. Indiscriminate fishing damages not only the ecosystem but also economic profits over the long run. But why do attempts to increase production not succeed? The reasons are roughly divided into two types, as has long been pointed out in the science of fishery (Clark 1990); they include economic discounting and the tragedy of the commons. We do not explain these in depth here, however, as a bigger problem is the very assumption that the relationship as shown in Fig. 9.1 exists. The ecosystem is uncertain, non-equilibrium, and complex, yet in Fig. 9.1 these three factors are not considered. They will be explained sequentially below. First, unless the reproduction relationship as shown in Fig. 9.1 is known, the MSY cannot be achieved. If 600,000 t is continuously caught when the MSY is 500,000 t, the resources will be exhausted. Next, Fig. 9.1 implies that if catches are continued at a certain level, the stock will settle at a certain amount, but this notion would in fact be laughed off by fishery operators. Populations of marine organisms fluctuate greatly depending on the environment, and while prohibition of fishing may even decrease populations in some cases, in other cases populations may not decrease even if many more individuals are caught. That is to say, the ecosystem is unsteady, and dynamic sustainability must be considered accordingly.This challenge can, however, be overcome by the adaptive management described later. In such cases, the prospects for resource recovery can be shown only in a probabilistic way. That is, risk management is required. Finally, Fig. 9.1 relates only to the fish species to be caught, but an increased population of a certain fish species concerns not only the stock of that particular species, but also the population sizes of the organisms on which they prey and their natural enemies. The MSY theory does not consider this point, either. The effects of such interaction among species lead to a need to manage the ecosystem as a whole. Theoretically, this differs considerably from population management (Matsuda and Abrams 2004, 2006, 2013). The southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) was intensively caught from the 1960s to the 1980s, resulting in stringent fishery controls being agreed on by an international management organization, the Commission for Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). They set a numerical target to recover the stock to its 1980 level by 2020, and in the latter half of the 1990s signs finally appeared to suggest that the resources would eventually be recovered. Then Japan substantially increased its catches without obtaining the consent of other countries, and was brought to the international court. Yet, after Japan reduced its catches again, southern bluefin tuna resources did not recover as expected. One reason was that the resource recovery prediction at the beginning was too optimistic (Mori et al 2001, see Fig. 9.2)"

As human populations grow and encroach on remaining bat habitat, humanâbat interactions are increasing, often with negative consequences for both parties through disease relationships (Schneeberger and Voigt 2016), occupation of human dwellings (Voigt et al. 2016), and conflict over fruit crops (Abdul Aziz et al. 2015). The Anthropocene is named for us, and solutions to our environmental problems rest with us, as Mascia et al. (2003) so concisely put it: âBiodiversity conservation is a human endeavor: initiated by humans, designed by humans, and intended to modify human behaviorââ(Mascia et al. 2003, p. 650). Bat conservation is no different from any other aspect of biodiversity conservation in this regard; attempts to reduce the many threats to bats ultimately hinge on changing peoplesâ behavior (Stern 2000; Ehrlich and Kennedy 2005; Schultz 2011; St John et al. 2013; VerÃ­ssimo 2013; Clayton and Myers 2015). âPeopleâ may range from bat hunters in rural villages to government officials or politicians in administrative centers, but as stakeholders in the issues surrounding bats, they must be motivated to change their actions and decisions (Menon and Lavigne 2006). How do we determine the stakeholders involved and how do we then change peopleâs minds and behavior? The scientific training of most bat biologists leaves us illequipped both practically (St John et al. 2010, 2014) and philosophically (Moon and Blackman 2014) and often extraordinarily naÃ¯ve, when it comes to dealing with people. Surely, if we share our knowledge and âeducateâ people, they will change their ways. Hunters in Ghana and Indonesia will be so impressed by the importance of bats as pollinators of their favorite fruit, or so fearful of disease risk, that they will stop hunting them. US politicians will mandate turbine cut-in speeds that reduce bat fatalities once they appreciate the critical role that bats play in the suppression of agricultural insect pests. Home owners will learn to live with their seasonal âattic batsâ because they are keeping down the summer mosquito population. Unfortunately, providing people with environmental knowledge alone is rarely enough to promote conservation behavior, and there is an enormous body of research from the social sciences, primarily from social psychology (St John et al. 2010; Teel et al. 2015), addressing the theoretical constructs behind behavior change. These constructs have provided frameworks for empirical assessments of attitudes and behaviors toward the environment and wildlife, and new disciplines such as human dimensions of wildlife (Manfredo 2008; Decker et al. 2012) and conservation psychology (Clayton and Myers 2015) have arisen in recent years, as a growing numbers of social scientists specialize in environmental or biodiversity conservation. Indeed, the Society for Conservation Biology established a Social Science Working Group in 2003 (http://conbio.org/groups/working-groups/socialscience), and a recent report from the Group provides an excellent introduction to the conservation social sciences (Bennett and Roth 2015)."

One important open question therefore is whether higher loads of plastic in younger animals reflect a learning process or mortality of those individuals that ingested too much plastic. Both explanations are speculative, but the latter suggests serious deleterious effects at the population level."
364,208,0.369,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"We need the concept of risk in fisheries and wildlife management because of several kinds of uncertainties. Traditional theory of maximum sustainable yield ignores such uncertainties and is not convincing for fishery operators, as biomass of fishery resources usually fluctuates remarkably. Risk analysis using stochastic models is useful and more convincing, even though the true mechanism of population dynamics is still unknown.We need risk evaluation to show a prediction range with some allowance. I recommend adaptive management as a method of coping with such uncertainty. Adaptive management can change the exploitation rate of fish/wildlife populations. It can reduce future uncertainties compared to a policy with a constant exploitation rate. Therefore, adaptive management is indispensable in fisheries and wildlife management. We do not make a single prediction, but show the risk of management failure, which is rarely eliminated because of uncertainties. We compare the risk of management failure between two scenarios in order to show the advantages of a recommended management policy."

There were some sporadic outliers (that is, fish with Cs concentrations outside the values predicted by linear regression Â± 2 SD). Except for these outliers, the Cs concentrations of each 2009 and 2010 year-class showed a decreasing tendency. In contrast, the Cs concentrations in the fish from the 2011 and 2012 year-classes were less than 10 (1.0 log transformed) Bq/kg-wet, and there were no outliers (that is, concentrations more than 2 SD from the mean). The Cs concentrations in fish from these year-classes between 644 and 841 days after the accident decreased in the order 2009 > 2010 > 2011 = 2012 year-class (SteelâDwass test; p < 0.05). Differences in Cs concentrations among the year-classes were likely the result of differing exposures to the highly contaminated environment during the first few months after the accident at the different ages (Fig. 11.4a). Japanese flounder switch from eating mysids during the first year of life to eating bait fish as they age. Therefore, fish from the 2009 year-class experienced the accident when they were 1 year and 9 months old, at which point they were feeding on bait fish. Fish in the 2010 year-class were only 9 months old at the time of the accident, and most of them were inhabiting shallow areas (<20 m deep) and feeding on mysids until summer 2011, at which point they shifted to feeding on bait fish. Fish in the 2011 yearclass were not born until 4 months after the accident. The Cs concentrations in fish caught during the period from December 2012 to June 2013 (644â841 days after the accident) from different year-classes are plotted against TL in Fig. 11.4b; the plot shows clear differences between the 2010 and 2011 year-classes, even in the same size range (344â420 mm TL; U test, p < 0.01).

233,13,0.368,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"During the last centuries and more dramatically in the last four decades, natural habitats were destroyed at rates much higher than ever observed in human history. All biomes were affected, but those located in tropical regions were more impacted, particularly because policies for the development and appropriation of these territories were emphasized during this period. Nonetheless, the massive transformation of these landscapes to give place to crops and towns multiplied speciesâ losses and vulnerability at incredible rates (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005), mostly due to the fact that most of worldâs biodiversity is concentrated around the tropics (Gaston 2000). In addition to habitat destruction and fragmentation, natural ecosystems were also submitted to high levels of pollution, overexploitation of forestry and ï¬shery resources, invasive species, and to the effects of climate changes mainly provoked by man-induced greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, a high number of species were already extinct and others have suffered severe populations declines (Mace et al. 2005), with many advancing at high speed to higher categories of threat every year (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2010). So, recent scenarios integrating main extinction drivers suggest that rates of extinction are likely to rise by at least a further order of magnitude over the next few centuries (Mace et al. 2005; Pereira et al. 2010; Barnosky et al. 2012; ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2013). This critical situation is now recognized as the âsixth mass extinctionâ, i.e. the sixth period in the history of life in which more than three-quarters of the living species is lost in a short geological interval (Barnosky et al. 2011). Compared to the ï¬rst âbig ï¬veâ, this extinction period has the peculiarity of being caused mainly by the way of living of one single species, the humans. Counteracting this trend is perhaps the biggest ethic, political and scientiï¬c challenge of our times (Sarkar 2005), as the time for action is short, funds for biodiversity conservation are far from below the real needs (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2012), uncertainties are enormous (Forest et al. 2015), and the solution of conï¬icts with main-trend ways-of-living and main patterns of distribution and consumption (e.g., Lenzen et al. 2012) often takes much longer than habitat destruction. In the race to combat extinctions, there is urgency for increasing conservation worldwide. The scientiï¬c community is pressed to provide criteria in order to deï¬ne priorities, as well as for indicating variables and standards that allows for monitoring the evolution of biodiversity in the light of these strategies (Hoffmann et al. 2010; Pereira et al. 2010, 2013; Mace et al. 2010, 2014). Traditionally, biodiversity conservation was based on species counts, valuing sites in terms of species richness, number of endemics and number of threatened species (Myers et al. 2000; Myers 2003; Kier et al. 2009). However, in spite of its generalized use, this kind of data can be very heterogeneous making very difï¬cult comparisons across taxonomic groups, along time and among sites, as species richness can be inï¬uenced by many factors, going from the species concept to the spatial scale and sampling effort (see Gaston 1996 for an overview on this subject). Similarly, in spite of the great interest of Red Lists of speciesâ threats, such as that from IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), to indicate imminent risks of extinction, concentrating conservation-limited resources on threatened species can be very risky and these limits must be considered (Possingham et al. 2002). Moreover, measures based on species counts also have the limitation of considering all species as equals, being"

However, these other causes for river warming are hard to quantify (Kaushal et al. 2010). At many sites, long-term increases in the water temperatures of streams and rivers typically coincided with increases in annual mean air temperatures. Warming trends also occur in rivers with sparsely settled catchments with intact forest cover. A comprehensive study by Orr et al. (2014) comprising 2773 sites across the United Kingdom showed warming trends (0.03  C per year) from 1990 to 2006, which are comparable to those reported for air temperature. Similarly, Markovic et al. (2013) showed increasing temperature trends for the Elbe and Danube rivers, which accelerated at the end of the twentieth century. Furthermore, seasonal shifts were indicated by earlier spring warming and an increase in the duration of summer heat phases. During the next century, global air temperatures are projected to increase by 1.5â4.5  C (Hartmann et al. 2013). This temperature increase will have manifold consequences for aquatic fauna, which are discussed in more detail in Sect. 11.3.4. Another important, human-induced impact that directly affects water temperature and thermal regimes is deforestation and removal of riparian vegetation. The removal of riparian vegetation can have tremendous effects on water temperatures as increased energy input from radiation induces heating. Small streams with lower heat capacity are quite vulnerable to this impact, especially where a full canopy of riparian vegetation naturally occurs."

36,513,0.368,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"growth trends tend to be unknown by biologists and managers, much less by the non-scientific members of the local community. So, even though local people are aware of the disturbance they may be causing, they often have no idea of the severity of population-level consequences. Because bats appear to be numerous, popular belief is that humans can have only minimal impact on their populations. For example, the greater short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx) is believed by experts to be threatened by hunting in parts of its range, but in other parts, <1 % of local people surveyed believe the species could be threatened by their hunting (Johnson et al. 2003). Similarly, throughout the Philippines, bats are eaten regularly with little understanding of the impacts that harvest is causing. Hunters who join biologists on bat population counts commonly overestimate the population size by three orders of magnitude prior to the count and then are shocked when the counted population is in the hundreds or low thousands (Mildenstein et al. 2007; Mildenstein 2012). Education and awareness programs. One of the most hunted bats in subSaharan Africa, E. helvum is the focus of members of the Eidolon Monitoring Network (EMN) who conduct education activities in areas near bat colonies (J. Fahr, pers. comm.). In Kenya and Nigeria, scientists and volunteers of the EMN carry out education programs in schools (Fig. 12.3) and among the general public (Tanshi et al. 2013). Education on islands around Africa has proven effective in drawing local attention to bat protection. Examples include the recovery program"

In addition, different ï¬sh species represent distinct trophic levels: omnivores, herbivores, insectivores, planktivores, and piscivores. â¢ Fishes occupy a variety of habitats in rivers: benthic, pelagic, rheophilic, limnophilic, etc. Species have speciï¬c habitat requirements and thus exhibit predictable responses to human-induced habitat alterations. â¢ Depressed growth and recruitment are easily assessed and reï¬ect stress. â¢ Fishes are valuable economic resources and are of public concern. Using ï¬shes as indicators confers an easy and intuitive understanding of cause effect relationships to stakeholders beyond the scientiï¬c community. There is a common agreement that the performance of any biological assessment approach increases with the quality rating of its ecological background (Verdonschot and Moog 2006). Consequentially there was a remarkable increase of taxa lists that associated ecological information with indicator taxa in the last 10â15 years. These taxa lists include functional ecosystem characteristics, species traits, and others more in ecological assessment (see Chap. 20)."
151,267,0.367,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"The JPCs for the concentrations modeled in Orestimba Creek, CA (Fig. 7) showed that fish and insects were at de minimis risk. The line for crustaceans was slightly above the reference line for low risk, indicating that some species of crustaceans are at low (but not de minimis) risk of adverse effects in this use scenario. The JPC for concentrations modeled in another focus-scenario, Cedar Creek, MI (Fig. 8) indicated de minimis risk for crustaceans, insects, and fish. The modeled concentrations in the other focus-scenario, Dry Creek, GA were smaller than those in Cedar Creek, MI (Table 8 in Williams et al. 2014), hence, these risks also were de minimis (JPC not shown). Overall, the probabilistic analyses of these data suggest that risks from direct effects of CPY on fish are de minimis in all areas of use. In most areas of use, as exemplified by the modeling of concentrations in Cedar Creek, MI and Dry Creek, GA, risks to insects and crustaceans will be de minimis as well. Low risk is also predicted for crustaceans in Orestimba Creek, CA, an intensive-use scenario that reasonably exemplifies the worst-case. There were insufficient toxicity data for CPY in sediment to conduct a probabilistic assessment of risk. However, comparison of the 10-d LC50 toxicity values for H. azteca and C. dilutus (Table 3) to the maximum modeled values of 22.2, 0.067, and 0.074 Î¼g kgâ1 resulted in RQs of 0.06, <0.001, and <0.001 for Orestimba Creek, Cedar Creek, and Dry Creek, respectively. The RQs for Cedar Creek and Dry Creek are well below the Level of Concern for all species. The RQ for Orestimba Creek is slightly greater than the Level of Concern (0.05; EPA 2004) for endangered and threatened (listed) invertebrates, but below the Level of Concern for other (nonlisted) species."
364,358,0.367,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"A total of 175 adult members of the public were given a questionnaire about the risks posed by the construction industry. This survey revealed that the majority were very much aware of the various risks faced by people, plants, and animals, as well as the risks to the environment as a result of construction activities. For example, most of them agreed that construction activity can cause soil erosion, floods, loss of natural resources, reduction in soil quality, and reduction of rain absorption area. The majority also recognized that loss of habitat, death, and destruction are some of the effects on plants and animals. Similarly, most of them agreed that animals may move away from an area where construction takes place. In addition, a large number of respondents also acknowledged that two risks faced by humans are health problems due to dust released during construction and feeling discomfort due to the noise from construction. However, only around one third of the sample considered that murky water caused by soil erosion from construction sites could have a negative effect on fish in rivers. In general, most of the people surveyed held similar perceptions about construction risks irrespective of their academic or social background. One notable exception, however, was educational level: Among the sample who responded to this survey, those who had completed university education obtained a mean score of 63.09 for construction risk awareness. Those who were educated up to pre-university level, on the other hand, obtained a corresponding mean score of 59.68. This difference is statistically significant as shown by the p value of .01 in the independent samples t-test analysis conducted. This implies that university education helped improve awareness of construction risk."

The relative scarcity of water creates a tension between allocating water for the beneï¬t of river health, and for direct social and economic beneï¬t. Irrigation uses 80% of the water consumed from the river, with the rest supplying industry, and drinking water for cities along the river and outside of the basin (Tianjin, Cangzhou and Qingdao). During the 1980s and 1990s the lower river dried up nearly every year, resulting in lost cereal production, suspension of some industries, and insufï¬cient water supplies for more than 100,000 residents, who had to queue daily for drinking water. As well as costing around RmB40 billion in lost production, there was a serious decline in the ecological health of the river. The diversity of habitat types and extensive areas of wetlands within the Ramsar-listed Yellow River Delta support at least 265 bird species. The birds, ï¬sh, and macroinvertebrates in the delta rely on healthy and diverse vegetation communities, which in turn depend upon on annual freshwater flooding and the associated high sediment loads. Degradation of the ecosystem of the Delta has been documented, especially from the late-1990s, due to increased human activities and a signiï¬cant decrease in the flow of freshwater to the Delta wetlands. This has led to saltwater intrusion and increased soil salinity. Restoration activities involving the artiï¬cial delivery of freshwater to the wetlands began in 2002."

230,573,0.364,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.2 Estimating the Economic Impacts of Marine Litter Measuring the full economic cost of marine litter is complex due to the wide range of economic, social and environmental impacts, the range of sectors impacted by marine litter and the geographic spread of those affected. Some of the impacts are easier to evaluate in economic terms because they are more direct, such as increased marine litter cleaning costs. Others are more complex, for example, the less direct and/or more intangible values such as the impacts of ecosystem deterioration or reductions in quality of life. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal complexity of the impacts related to marine litter result in costs, which may not always be immediate or conspicuous but are nevertheless significant for sustainability (National Research Council 2008). As regards ecosystem degradation, it is useful to differentiate between impacts on biodiversity (species and habitats) and the impact on the ecosystem services flowing from the ecosystem (e.g. provisioning services such as food provision, regulating services such as water and waste purification; and cultural services such as tourism and recreation). As regards economic costs it is important to differentiate between actual economic costs linked to expenditure (e.g. costs of cleanup of beaches; costs associated with damage to or loss of fishing gear or obstruction of motors; eventual cost of hospitalisation from marine debris related health impacts), economic costs of loss of output or revenue (e.g. loss of revenue from fish or loss of income from tourism) and assessment of welfare costs in economic terms (e.g. health impacts from marine debris; assessing the economic value of loss of cultural values such as recreation or landscape aesthetics). While marine litter has become an increasingly important issue in policy discussions, there is only a very sketchy (albeit growing) body of knowledge on the costs of the impacts. Because of a lack of recording even the direct economic costs of marine litter tend not to be measured (Mouat et al. 2010). Furthermore, even though there is a growing interest in ecosystem services (Costanza et al. 1997; MA 2005; TEEB 2010, 2011) little research has been done to date on the economic cost of marine litter on ecosystem service provision.

36,128,0.364,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"successional stages of tropical dry forest in Mexico (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009). This likely reflects distinct differences in the composition of early successional vegetation, and consequently resource scarcity, in tropical dry compared to wet forests. Pinto and Keitt (2008) found that the abundances of Sturnira spp. were positively associated with secondary forest cover, reflecting the speciesâ preference for early successional vegetation. Conversely, Carollia spp. responded to forest cover that included both primary and secondary forests, implying that habitat connectivity may be more important than successional stage for populations in this genus. As with logged forests, these findings suggest species-specific responses to secondary vegetation linked to interspecific differences in diet, home range size, and body size. Contrary to the flexible responses observed for many frugivores and nectarivores, a large body of empirical evidence indicates that gleaning animalivorous phyllostomines are sensitive to forest degradation, as they are absent or occur at low abundance in secondary regrowth (Fenton et al. 1992; Brosset et al. 1996; MedellÃ­n et al. 2000; Faria 2006; Castro-Luna et al. 2007a, b; Mancina et al. 2007; Willig et al. 2007; Pardini et al. 2009; Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010; de la PeÃ±aCuÃ©llar et al. 2012; Vleut et al. 2012, 2013). Some studies have detected a clear pattern of species richness increasing across successional gradients (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009; de la PeÃ±a-CuÃ©llar et al. 2012), but this pattern has not been evident in others (Castro-Luna et al. 2007a; Mancina et al. 2007). Nonetheless, for Neotropical wet and dry forests, floristically more diverse and structurally more complex habitats harbor greater taxonomic and functional richness than do early or intermediate stages of succession. Here, vegetation complexity appears to be an important factor shaping assemblage composition (MedellÃ­n et al. 2000; Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009; Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010; Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012; de la PeÃ±a-CuÃ©llar et al. 2012). Late successional forest stands often host many bat species not found in earlier stages, in particular rare taxa, and through succession, the number of species and ensembles increases for frugivorous, nectarivorous, and gleaning animalivorous taxa (AvilaCabadilla et al. 2009, 2012; de la PeÃ±a-CuÃ©llar et al. 2012). In tropical wet forest in Mexico, abundances of the most common bat species were associated positively or negatively with variation in canopy cover across successional stages, rather than with landscape attributes (Castro-Luna et al. 2007a). In contrast, a study in Mexican tropical dry forest found evidence for an important role of local (vegetation complexity) and landscape attributes (area and cover of different vegetation types) as determinants of variation in abundance, which were ensemble specific and scale dependent (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012). In Central Amazonia, gleaning animalivorous phyllostomid bats exhibited greater abundance and richness in Cecropia-dominated regrowth, whereas stenodermatine frugivores were more abundant in abandoned pastures and Vismia-dominated regrowth, demonstrating that different successional trajectories result from differences in land-use history (cutting versus cutting and burning) that lead to distinct differences in bat assemblage composition (Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010). Despite the recovery potential of Neotropical bat assemblages during succession, the conservation value of secondary forests for bats critically hinges"
151,306,0.364,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"food is a factor. Because flowable CPY may be applied up to four times per growing season, chronic risk was also estimated for that formulation. For the chronic assessment, preferred metrics included the most sensitive of the population-relevant endpoints, viz., survival, growth and reproduction. The following decision criteria were used in deriving effects metrics for each focal species: (1) If a toxicity study with five or more treatments was available for the focal species or a reasonable surrogate, then a dose-response curve was derived for that species; (2) If multiple toxicity studies that followed a similar protocol and together had five or more treatments were available for the focal species or a reasonable surrogate, then a dose-response curve was derived for that species; (3) For untested focal species, an SSD was derived. Without toxicity data for a focal species, there is uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of that species to CPY. To deal with this uncertainty, the SSD was used to bound the risk estimates (i.e., assume 5th and 95th centile sensitivity on the SSD) and to estimate median risk (i.e., assume 50th centile sensitivity on the SSD) (USEPA 2005). Dose-response curves were then derived for low (95th centile), median (50th centile) and high (5th centile) sensitivity species by using a distribution of the available LD50 data and measured dose-response curve slopes. Because insufficient bird species have been tested for chronic exposure, the most sensitive effects metrics were assumed for all focal species. Each toxicity study was evaluated, and acceptable studies met the following criteria: (1) Single contaminant exposure only; (2) Gavage (acute) or dietary (chronic) route of exposure; (3) Ecologically-significant endpoint (e.g., survival, reproduction, growth); (4) Adequate statistical design (e.g., five or more treatments including controls, responses spanning most of the range of 0â100% effect including at least one treatment with a partial response) to estimate toxic effect doses; and (5) Study employed acceptable laboratory practices or was previously accepted by EPA (USEPA 2009). Studies that did not meet the above criteria were not used to derive effects metrics. Risk characterization. Three lines of evidence were used to characterize risks of CPY to birds: (1) Modeling of exposure and effects; (2) Information available from field studies; and (3) Information available from incident reports. Risk curves were derived for each exposure scenario and focal bird species by determining the percentages of fields that had â¥5% mortality (â¥1/20 dead birds per field), â¥10% mortality (â¥2/20 dead birds per field), â¥15% mortality (â¥3/20 dead birds per field), â¦ , 100% mortality (20/20 dead birds per field). The result was a plot of probability of exceedence versus magnitude of effect. Similar approaches have been used in ecological risk assessments performed for the EPA at the Calcasieu Estuary, Louisiana, the Housatonic River, Massachusetts (USEPA 2002, 2004a) and by others assessing the ecological risk of pesticides (Giddings et al. 2005; Moore et al. 2010a, b, c; Solomon et al. 2001). In this assessment, area under the risk curve (AUC) was estimated for each combination of focal species and exposure scenario. AUC is the area under the curve divided by the sum of the AUC and the area above the curve, with the result multiplied by 100. The AUC was used to"

Lessening the impacts of future drought events typically requires the development of drought risk policies that emphasize a wide range of water conservation and early warning measures. Drought management techniques are often conditional on the severity of the drought. Identifying the actions to take and the thresholds indicating when to take them are best accomplished prior to a drought, as agreements among stakeholders are easier to obtain when individuals are not having to deal with the impacts of an ongoing drought. Drought impacts can be economic, environmental, and social. Economic impacts can include direct losses to agricultural and industrial users, losses in recreation, transportation, and energy sectors. Other indirect economic impacts can include resulting unemployment and loss of tax revenue to local, state, and federal governments. Environmental losses include damages to plant and animal species in natural habitats, and reduced air and water quality; an increase in forest and range ï¬res; the degradation of landscape quality; and possible soil erosion. These losses are difï¬cult to quantify, but growing public awareness and concern for environmental quality has forced public ofï¬cials to focus greater attention on them. Social impacts can involve public safety, health, conflicts among water users, and inequities in the distribution of impacts and disaster relief programs.

They are depicted alone, or in about a third of the images with humans, usually as recipients of veterinary care, but occasionally as âhands and pawsâ, evoking the imagery seen in fig. 6.5, and the famous National Geographic image of Jane Goodall and a chimpanzee hand in hand. These images seem to be drawing on conservation and animal welfare campaigning to advance ideas of human care for, and custodianship of, animals.96 While occasionally wild animals appear in relation to zoonotic disease transmission, these are usually less sympathetic animals such as bats, at times manipulated to look more threatening.97 The prominence of wildlife in these images contrasts heavily with the published literature on OH, where beyond the generic category of âwild animalsâ, individual species barely feature. Eight photographs in the sample show animals as patients, with human clinicians working directly with them in one way or another.

Therefore, the area inside the fences may be attractive for herbivores in winter, leading to some ungulates trying to enter it. Once inside the fenced area, the animal may not be able to ï¬nd suitable locations to jump or crawl out of the fence again or may become too weak to do so. Note, however, that we found some carcasses entangled in the fenceâs barbed wires (Fig. 14.9), suggesting that the fence itself is a cause of mortality. Several questions remain concerning the interpretation of areas of high carcass density. For example, was animal density simply higher in these areas? Did a large number of animals try to cross there because the area looked easy to pass? Did the area have any intrinsic factors that cause higher mortality? For example, do the fence structures easily entangle animals, making it difï¬cult to escape once inside? Finally, the genetic structure of the gazelle populations sampled in the 2005 survey was not different between the two sides of the railway (Okada et al. 2012, 2015). This can be explained by animals occasionally crossing the railway via underpasses and areas with broken fences, and other permeable areas. In addition, the survey was conducted just about 50 years after the railwayâs construction, which is not enough time for genetic differentiation given the relatively long lifespan of the species. Therefore, the genetic structure of wild ungulate populations may differentiate in the future if the railway barrier effects persist."

Future investigations could also consider the trophic transfer of MPs through the freshwater food chain, particularly in the case of Nile perch which are known to feed on smaller fish (haplochromine cichlids) and gastropods, as well as any potential âvector effectâ that facilitates the movement of adhered contaminants through the food chain [53]. These are important aspects to study primarily because the top predators in these food chains are the local residents that ultimately consume the fish. Given the existing population density surrounding Lake Victoria and its estimated growth, the prevalence of plastic debris and subsequently MPs is also likely to increase. The reliance on the lake as a resource means that any potential impacts of MPs on the ecosystem and biota need to be researched, assessed, and, if possible, mitigated. However, research activities should not be confined only to Lake Victoria. A number of African freshwater bodies are just as likely or even more likely to be impacted by MP pollution. Potentially, the main message to be taken from these case studies is the relative simplicity by which they were accomplished. In particular, the purchase of fish from market and subsequent dissections required little specialist scientific equipment and could be replicated in other locations. In the following section, we consider the current challenges to MP research and mitigation in Africa and discuss future research needs."

222,685,0.362,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"In order to explore the impact of particular fisheries, management scenarios model runs using the species-based model for Hilsa shad and Bombay duck were undertaken. For this exercise, averaged outputs of the three climate ensembles were calculated to enable a focus specifically on the relative impacts of fisheries management decisions. The results are presented relative to the year 2000 model outputs (not the actual catches), but the different management interventions are implemented at year 1980, as the model needs to settle and reflect the interventions before the period of analysis. For this reason, by 2000 the three management trajectories already diverge from the actual recorded catches. Results conclude that both Hilsa shad and Bombay duck catches will decline over time regardless of the fisheries management regime, but to different degrees (Fig. 25.4). For Hilsa the decline stabilises under MSY management at 175,000 t by 2035, while it virtually collapses around the same period under the OF scenario. A significant inter-annual variability is also observed (Fig. 25.4). By the 2050s the decline in catches is between 39 per cent (under MSY) and 87 per cent. For Bombay duck inter-annual variability is reduced (Fig. 25.4), and while catch potential declines continuously under all management scenarios, they do not lead to biological collapse. By the 2050s this decline is around 35 per cent for all management scenarios. Potential catches are on average higher in the more sustainable scenarios (MSY) than in the BAU scenario for both species (91 per cent in Hilsa Shad and 37 per cent in Bombay duck by the 2050s). It is useful to compare the outcomes of the BAU scenario in the 2000s decade with those of a more sustainable scenario in coming decades. The results indicate that a change to sustainable management would result in a very minor decline in potential catches by the 2020s but a still significant"
126,273,0.362,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Without a successful sorghum harvest, the Dasanech in the riverine and delta region are often forced to sell their remaining livestock in order to survive. This has in fact been the case for countless households in recent years. East bank Dasanech agropastoral households, for example, often have no alternative but to market their remaining cattle or small stock in Omorate or other markets frequented by Hamar, Arbore or Kenyan Somalis. â¢ Wild food gathering is critical for Dasanech survival, especially during harsh times. These include periods of prolonged drought when livestock milk and other products are reduced or when for example, the omo annual flood is insufï¬cient for agriculture or for successfull ï¬shing. The poorest Dasanechâthose without livestock or farm plotsârely on this food source much of the time, particularly in recent times. Most wild food gathering is done in the riverine and delta zonesâprecisely the environments most in line for desiccation from the destroyed from the effects of the Gibe III dam and irrigated commercial agricultural enterprises. â¢ Fishing is done by thousands of Dasanech households and is key to survival of most of them. It is no longer limited to the âpoorest of the poorâ communities and households. The critical role that ï¬shing, as well as recession agriculture, has Agriculture have come to play, in the face of major herd decline, is stated by this elder in the southeastern Omo delta: We eat ï¬sh every day. If others have sorghum, they will cook it and eat it. Some of us have been ï¬shing for a long time âmore than those others. Other Dasanech came to join us after they lost their cattle and small stock from drought and disease. Thousands of us are here! Many of our people died because they had nothing to eatâand before they could get here to try to plant or ï¬sh. â¢ Fishing communities utilize their catch for varying combinations of domestic consumption and exchangeâwhether barter or cash sale in local markets. Dasanech ï¬shers exploit whatever river and lake locales they can access, depending on Omo River flow patterns and annual flood occurrence, seasonal shifts in ï¬sh life cycles, availability of ï¬shing gear, security conditions and other factors. Major ï¬shing areas include the lowermost Omo and fringing Omo delta channels and the nutrient-rich waters along Lake Turkanaâs northern shorelineâwaters nourished by the riverâs annual freshwater and âpulseâ that sustains ï¬sh reproductive locales there (Figs. 5.2 and 7.14). The most common ï¬sh caught by the Dasanech at the mouth of the Omo channels and along Lake Turkanaâs northern shoreline are tilapia and Nile perch. The most common catch species for the Dasanech are the same as those for Turkana ï¬shers (see Chap. 9). Dasanech male ï¬shers also hunt crocodile and hippo at nightâthe populations of which have radically dwindled to the point of endangerment9. Many ï¬shing households still use the simplest of technologies: metal spears and harpoons with string (from barter with other ethnic groups), locally crafted dug-out canoes fashioned from riverine forest trees (Fig. 7.8) or simple rafts constructed from doum palm trunks lashed together (see photos in Chap. 9). Others have wooden boats and nets, with additional gear. Dasanech ï¬shers originally obtained much of their knowledge of ï¬shing, as well as ï¬shing technology, from the Turkana. They now acquire equipment through barter, purchase and capture. During investigations in Turkana villages along the lakeâs northwestern shoreline, for example, this writer recorded numerous accounts of violenceâ killings as well as gear theftsâbetween Turkana and Dasanech ï¬shers. â¢ Dasanech ï¬shers report rapidly declining ï¬sh catch, especially with the incursion of commercial ï¬shing fleets based in Ethiopiaâcompanies promoted and protected by the GOE. Commercial catch is primarily destined for urban Ethiopian and export markets. Efforts to develop facilities for ï¬sh refrigeration and processing were initiated by the GOE for years, with active solicitation of investment by the SNNPR and federal government by the early years of this writerâs investigation, when three major companies were active in the lowermost river and in Kenyaâs Lake Turkana."
364,190,0.362,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Capture fishery is an industry that enables humans to utilize wild seafoods as a resource, although, if overfished, breeding individuals become short of supply, making it impossible to secure the resources in the future. Accordingly, theories of resource management for appropriate fishing have long existed, although such theories typically ignore uncertainty. Of the conventional resource management theories, one such theory that ignores uncertainty is the classical theory of âmaximum sustainable yield,â or MSY, that appears in fisheries and wildlife management (Clark 1990). In the classical MSY theory, we consider the reproduction curve as shown in Fig. 9.1. The formulae are shown at the end of the chapter. Biological populations are characterized by exponential growth in population numbers. Calculated in the simplest possible way, the per capita growth rate of a population would increase constantly, like the relationship between the amount of a bank deposit and interest (corresponding to the thin line in Fig. 9.1). However, the per capita growth rate in fact decreases as the stock increases because availability of food, habitat, and other resources becomes limited. Therefore, the surplus production, or the product of the population number and the per capita growth rate, forms a peak, corresponding to the bold curve in Fig. 9.1. In addition, the population does not increase beyond a threshold, which is called carrying capacity, denoted by K in Fig. 9.1. The surplus production produces a curve of one crest in relation to the stock, as in Fig. 9.1, and with an intermediate stock level, the largest catches can be continued. The catches are called MSY, which in the case of Fig. 9.1 is 500,000 t. If the surplus production is larger than the catches (implied by the broken line in Fig. 9.1), the resources increase. If it is smaller, they decrease. The equilibrium stock biomass under the given catch level is the intersection of the surplus production curve and the catch"
36,248,0.362,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Valuation of bat-mediated pest suppression is limited for staple crops and for sites outside the southern USA. In northern Mexico, the impact of T. brasiliensis predation on avoided agricultural costs across a variety of staple and commodity crops was estimated at a far more modest $19 per ha and year (GÃ¡ndara Fierro et al. 2006). In Thailand, the value of wrinkle-lipped bat (Tadarida plicata) predation on a major rice pest, the white-back planthopper (Sogatella furcifera), was estimated to have a monetary value of $1.2 million annually (Wanger et al. 2014). This estimate results in a seemingly paltry $0.13 per ha and year value considered against Thailandâs 8.7 million ha (Redfern et al. 2012) of rice paddies, but in this case an economic approach obscures the true value of the service: This single bat species prevents the loss of nearly 2900 metric tons of rice per year, enough to feed Thailandâs entire population of 66.8 million people for a week. Such investigations underscore the potentially grave consequences for human food security should global bat populations continue declining (Kunz et al. 2011)."

36,340,0.361,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"8.4.1 Restoration of Water Sources and Related Habitats Most wetlands have been altered globally due to anthropogenic disruption, pollution, and outright destruction. In some, but too few, places, humans have begun to restore some of those wetlands. For example, in the USA, the Sierra Nevada Conservancy is working in cooperation with State Parks, the Department of Toxic Substances, California State University Chico and others, to identify mercury sources and potential remediation strategies for an abandoned hydraulic mine discharging sediment and heavy metals into the Yuba River and removing mercury from dredged sediment that have accumulated in the Combie Reservoir. In California, restoration of the Cosumnes River floodplain re-established bat activity that broadly corresponded with flooding and an increase in aquatic emergent insects (Rainey et al. 2006). Furthermore restoration of riparian habitat, frequently damaged by cattle as well as other anthropogenic uses, and wetlands commonly destroyed by human development, is essential and is occurring in some areas, but well below necessary levels for bat conservation (Goodwin et al. 1997). Despite some of the negative effects highlighted in the previous section concerning waste water effluent, wastewater reclamation is an important process especially in areas where water is scare (Anderson et al. 2001). Wastewater can be used to construct artificial wetlands that provide habitat for wildlife if the water is properly treated (Greenway and Simpson 1996; Fujioka et al. 1999; Greenway and Woolley 1999; Greenway 2005). Some studies have found that increased nutrient loads, such as those caused by wastewater effluent may have a positive effect on insect and bat abundance both in US and European streams (Kokurewicz 1995; Vaughan et al. 1996; Abbott et al. 2009). One US study found that bat activity and foraging levels were the same up-stream and down-stream of wastewater discharge but community structure was altered, with the riparian-specialist Perimyotis subflavus being more abundant (Kalcounis-Rueppell et al. 2007)."
233,102,0.361,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Introduction There is mounting evidence that we are entering a sixth mass extinction (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005), and the future of biodiversity is at risk due to the high rates at which biological diversity â species, habitats, evolutionary diversity â is being eroded. Species are experiencing unprecedented pressures across their ranges owing to global change, including increased invasion success of aliens (Winter et al. 2009), habitat destruction (Vitousek et al. 1997; Haberl et al. 2007), climate change and climate variability (Willis et al. 2008, 2010). Consequently, approximately 30 % of assessed species are currently categorised as threatened by the IUCN, and a greater proportion may be committed to extinction in the near future (Thomas et al. 2004). Current rates of species loss might be 1,000â10,000 times greater than past extinction rates (Pimm et al. 1995; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) with particularly elevated rates in tropical biomes (Vamosi and Vamosi 2008), known for their unique life-form diversity. At the ecosystem level, with the loss of species, we also lose their contributions to overall ecosystem functioning and services. The loss of ecosystem services is of particular concern because human survival relies strongly on key services such as food production, plant pollination, medicinal plants, clean water, clean air, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, climate stability, recreation, tourism, etc. â which are provided by a well functioning system of biological diversity. It is well established that human activities can drive extinctions within a short period of time (Baillie et al. 2004; Mace et al. 2005a). Because human population has increased exponentially over the last centuries, and is expected to reach nine billion by 2050 (www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/2004worldpo p2300reportï¬nalc.pdf), pressure on natural ecosystems is also predicted to increase, yet at the same time there will be an even greater demand for the ecosystem services provided by biologically diverse natural systems. As a result, the rate of species extinction is projected to rise by at least a further order of magnitude over the next few hundred years (Mace et al. 2005b), potentially decreasing the provisioning of ecosystem services at a time when demand is growing. Understanding how the ongoing extinction crisis will impact the provisioning of critical ecosystem services is therefore a matter of urgency. Quantifying the ecosystem contributions of individual species is a major challenge. Current estimates of global diversity vary by over an order of magnitude (see e.g. May 2010), with the vast majority of species (86 % and 91 % of terrestrial and oceanic diversity, respectively) remaining unknown to science (Mora et al. 2011). An in-depth understanding of species ecologies is therefore impractical for most of life; at best, we might be able to infer their placement on the tree-of-life. Whilst there is now a general consensus on the positive link between biodiversity and ecosystem function (Hooper et al. 2012), there has been growing evidence suggesting that evolutionary history provides a more informative measure of biological diversity than traditional metrics based upon richness and abundance (e.g. Faith 1992; Faith et al. 2010; Davies and Cadotte 2011; see also Srivastava et al. 2012 for a comprehensive review). It is suggested that evolutionary history might better capture"
36,74,0.361,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"other colonies. All âsolutionsâ will lead to a fall in bat density near to the road. The overall fall in habitat quality will most likely lead to reduced reproductive success and increased adult mortality and in long-lived bats these will have a profound effect on local colony size and overall population size (Sendor and Simon 2003; Papadatou et al. 2011). Given the magnitude and spatial scale of the effects on bat activity and diversity observed by Berthinussen and Altringham (2012a), it is likely that barrier and edge effects, together with increased roadkill are having a strong negative effect on the demographics and distribution of local bat populations in proximity to major roads. Similar effects have been found in other vertebrates. Reijnen and Foppen (1994) showed that a decreased density of willow warblers up to 200 m from a major highway was due to the negative influence of the road on population sizes, with reduced breeding success and increased emigration of territorial males. Studies on breeding grassland birds revealed a decrease in density of seven out of 12 species, with disturbance distances up to 3500 m from the busiest roads (50,000 vehicles per day), with collision mortality being a major contributor (Reijnen et al. 1996). A meta-analysis of 49 studies that between them investigated 234 bird and mammal species, found that bird population densities declined up to 1 km, and mammal population densities declined up to 5 km from roads (BenÃ­tezLÃ³pez et al. 2010)."
36,355,0.361,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"9.1 Introduction In late winter of 2007, biologists at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation encountered a macabre scene during their annual winter surveys of hibernating bats in caves and mines in northern New York State: heaps of dead bats piled on cave floors (Fig. 9.1) (Veilleux 2008). Bats were also seen flying out in the middle of winter onto the snowy landscape and the number of citizen reports of dead bats found in backyards was much higher than normal. A white fuzzy growth was observed on muzzles and wings of the few remaining live bats, which led to the name white-nose syndrome (WNS) (Veilleux 2008; Reeder and Turner 2008; Turner and Reeder 2009). WNS is now recognized as one of the most devastating wildlife epidemics in recorded history and has caused the death of millions of bats in eastern North America. The research and management response to WNS has been rapid and we know much more about WNS than when those first dead bats were observed in New York, although there is still a great deal about this wildlife disease that is yet to be resolved. The first evidence of WNS in North America is dated to a photograph taken by a caver at Howeâs Cave in 2006 (Turner and Reeder 2009). Howeâs Cave is a popular tourist attraction that receives hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, many of whom visit from other parts of the world. The white fuzzy growth visible on bats is caused by a pathogenic fungus, which was described as Geomyces destructans (Gargas et al. 2009; Blehert et al. 2009), but was recently re-named Pseudogymnoascus destructans after closer evaluation of its taxonomic allies (Minnis and Lindner 2013). The fungus infects the skin tissues, including the wings and tail membranes, and causes bats to arouse too frequently from torpor"

In the USA, fatalities peak in mid-July through early September in most parts of the country (Johnson 2005; Arnett et al. 2008; Baerwald and Barclay 2011; Arnett and Baerwald 2013). Studies from Europe demonstrate a similar pattern (e.g., in Germany, where most (about 90 %) bat fatalities at wind turbines occur between mid-July and the end of September; Brinkmann et al. 2011; Lehnert et al. 2014). Some studies from northern Europe and North America demonstrate smaller peaks of fatalities during spring (Arnett et al. 2008; Rydell et al. 2010a). In Greece and on the Iberian Peninsula of Spain and Portugal, the pattern is similar, with most (>90 %) fatalities in late summer (Georgiakakis et al. 2012; Camina 2012; Amorim et al. 2012), but in some places, particularly at high elevation sites, fatalities occur from May to October and without any obvious concentration in the late summer period (DubourgSavage et al. 2011; Camina 2012). Such consistent temporal patterns of fatality are helpful when predicting high-risk periods and applying some mitigation measures such as raising turbine cut-in speed (Arnett et al. 2011, Baerwald et al. 2009). Hull and Cawthen (2012) noted that fatalities predominantly occurred in autumn in Tasmania, where the climate is temperate. However, in the tropical Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico, while 46 % of bat fatalities were found in the summer rainy season, no clear pattern in bat deaths associated with any season emerged. In summary, while there are clear temporal patterns and a distinct late summer fatality peak in high-latitude temperate regions (north Europe and North America), the pattern becomes less obvious in warmer climates at lower temperate latitudes (south Europe) and temporal patterns may dissipate entirely in tropical regions (e.g., southern Mexico)."

Such exemplar species that speak to everyone from layperson to scientist, include the Coelacanth ï¬sh, the Tuatara squamate, the Kiwi bird, the Platypus mammal, the Ginkgo tree, etc. All these species are said to be relict, because they represent groups that are mostly extinct (Grandcolas et al. 2014). The message is that these species should be cared for, because their extinction would cause a loss of information about distinct sections of life on Earth and their evolution. Generally, this powerful message is naively extended to characterize the place where these species are found, implying that the biota as a whole is a kind of Noahâs ark, globally worthy of consideration for conservation biology (see for example, Gibbs 2006 for the case of New Zealand, or Thorne 1999 for Asia). To our knowledge, everyone agrees with these views and even the most hardhearted companies or governments would difï¬culty take responsibility for destroying such emblematical âsurvivorsâ. The public message in endorsing this destruction would be that they are the fools that spoil unique multimillion year antiques, even worse than to break a Vase de Soissons into thousands of pieces or to lacerate a delicate and wonderfully conserved Da Vinci painting. Even if very consensual, such emotive views about relicts and biodiversity conservation are still often presented informally, which prevent them to be fully scientiï¬c, i.e. theoretically justiï¬ed, measurable and repeatable. If then we try to set aside the emotional aspects of these views about relicts, what remains for conservation biology as a rational argument? Do relicts actually represent invaluable species for conservation purposes and why? Are they particularly exotic cases that do not account for most situations encountered by land managers or are they extreme cases of common situations? To answer these questions, we need to carefully deï¬ne relicts with phylogenetic and paleontological tools. The properties of such characterizations need to be explored regarding the most important issues in conservation biology."

In areas where small boats are numerous, the cumulative effect of boat moorings and propeller scars can result in considerable loss of vegetation (Walker et al. 1989; Creed and Amado Filho; 1999; Hemminga and Duarte 2000), although losses due to these mechanical disturbances are likely small relative to damage caused by elevated water turbidity (Onuf 1994). Rapid degradation and loss of coastal wetland habitats may be considered the greatest threat to many nekton species of special interest in the GoM (Thomas 1999; Contreras-Espinosa and Warner 2004). However, nekton assemblages in both the northern (Gravitz 2008) and southern (Contreras-Espinosa and Warner 2004; Contreras-Espinosa and CastanÌeda-Lopez 2007; Ortiz and Lalana 2005) GoM are affected directly and indirectly by activities associated with commercial and recreational fisheries exploitation. The status of many managed fisheries in the GoM is poorly understood with respect to overharvest, but there are some well-known examples of depressed populations of formerly abundant inshore fish families such as the Sciaenidae, especially red drum (Tilmant et al. 1989) and reef fishes, whose juveniles commonly use coastal wetland habitats (Contreras-Espinosa and Warner 2004; Ortiz and Lalana 2005; Gravitz 2008). Removal of larger predatory fishes targeted in many recreational and commercial fisheries can have important implications for trophic dynamics within estuaries that result in shifts in associated nekton assemblages (Pauly et al. 1998; Hall et al. 2000). Although it has been suggested that heavy fishing pressure following periods of high weather-related natural mortality events has hampered the recovery of some penaeid stocks within the GoM (Kutkuhn 1962), the penaeid shrimp fisheries of the GoM were long considered virtually impervious to overharvesting (Lindner and Anderson 1956). Unlike many larger, longlived fish species targeted in recreational and commercial fisheries, penaeids are annual species that are reproductively prolific and population variation is largely controlled by environmental conditions, especially in estuarine wetland nursery habitats. In fact, because the fishery is considered fully exploited but not overharvested, it was proposed that trends in shrimp landings could be used as indicators of regional estuarine habitat quality (OâConnor and Matlock 2005). However, recent concerns have arisen about growth overfishing (i.e., decreases in the size of shrimp harvested) of some penaeid stocks in the GoM (Caillouet et al. 2008). The unintended effects of fishing gear on nekton populations may have an even greater effect on nekton that are not specifically targeted by the principal fisheries in the GoM. Most mobile fishing gear disturbs habitats and potential prey resources for nekton populations (Watling and Norse 1998). Incidental taking of non-targeted species in by-catch is considered by many to be the most significant problem in fisheries management, with shrimp trawling producing the highest discard/catch ratio (Hall et al. 2000). The blue crab fishery, which uses largely stationary gear (i.e., crab traps), also has important indirect effects on many other nekton in the GoM. At least 23 species of fishes, including important recreational fisheries species among the Sciaenidae (drums), have been incidentally killed or injured in crab traps (Guillory et al. 2001). Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) are also among the coastal wetland nekton negatively impacted as by-catch of the crab fishery in the GoM (Butler and Heinrich 2007; Hart and Crowder 2011). Like many other long-lived species that are subjected to overharvesting, even unintentionally, it is the juvenile terrapins that are most susceptible to mortality in crab traps (Dorcas et al. 2007)."

231,804,0.359,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"north-western North Sea, resulting in unfavourable environmental conditions (Corten 2013). A second, continuing period of weak recruitment began in 2002, when the adult population was large and exploitation low. This is ascribed to the warming of the North Sea and substantial changes in the zooplankton community described earlier in this chapter (Payne et al. 2009, 2013) which resulted in lower growth rates of larvae and hence probably lower survival. The North Sea herring population consists of several spawning components and recruitment is the sum of the survivors of many spawning events, with different spawning grounds and timing, experiencing different environmental conditions (HjÃ¸llo et al. 2009; Rijnsdorp et al. 2009). It is therefore naÃ¯ve to search for single environmental drivers; spatial and temporal differences must be taken into account, as must the influence of parental factors (Dickey-Collas et al. 2010). It is paradoxical that recruitment of both sole and plaice is higher following cold spring conditions (Ottersen et al. 2013), since plaice is close to the warm end of its range in the North Sea and sole is close to the cold end of its range. Cold temperatures in March delay spawning in sole, but it is not known whether recruitment is determined during the pelagic egg and larval stages, or during the early demersal stage (van der Land 1991; Kjesbu et al. 1998; Rijnsdorp and Witthames 2005). For plaice the higher survival during colder winters is probably related to mortality of their predators during both the pelagic and early demersal stages (Van der Veer et al."
36,774,0.359,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"population (Bates et al. 2001; Pereira et al. 2007; Puechmaille et al. 2011). These discoveries have led to changes in the dynamic of conservation for Craseonycteris, since conservation priorities are often related to species range sizes. Similarly, ongoing discovery of cryptic species in Africa, such as Rosevearâs serotine (Neoromicia roseveari), has led to calls for protection of the Upper Guinean forests, which are threatened by rampant human disturbance (Monadjem et al. 2013). There are times when national recognition of a species as endangered comes too late, resulting in extinction. In some cases, this is in part due to taxonomic confusionâa circumstance that underlines the importance of taxonomy for conservation. The Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi) is an unfortunate example from Australia. The only native insectivorous bat on Christmas Island, it was once widespread but underwent dramatic population declines by the mid1990s (Beeton et al. 2010). The reasons for this decline remain unclear, but likely include introduction of non-native species (e.g., common wolf snake, feral cats, giant centipedes, and yellow crazy ants) that either disturbed roost sites or preyed on bats (Lumsden et al. 2007). It is also possible that control efforts focused on yellow crazy ants (Anoplolepis gracilipes) might have inadvertently poisoned the bats (Beeton et al. 2010). The muddled taxonomic history of the Christmas Island pipistrelle apparently contributed to poor management decisions. Koopman (1973, 1993) considered P. murrayi to be a synonym of P. tenuis, a common Southeast Asian species, apparently based on general morphological similarity. Hill and Harrison (1987) treated P. murrayi as a separate species based on the presence of a distinctive baculum, but this gained little attention at the time. Lack of a focused taxonomic treatment of the pipistrelle species complex resulted in lack of any real consensus about the status of the Christmas Island pipistrelle. The Australian government was slow to act upon findings from a long-term monitoring program, which recommended captive breeding programs for the Christmas Island pipistrelle in 2006 (Martin et al. 2012). It was only after genetic studies by Beeton et al. (2010) corroborated that P. murrayi was a distinct species that an emergency response was initiated in 2009 (Martin et al. 2012). However, these efforts came too lateâthe Christmas Island pipistrelle apparently became extinct in 2009 (Lumsden 2009). Placing a species on international or national lists may be a prerequisite for local conservation actions such as habitat restoration or protection. The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) is listed as Endangered under the USâs ESA. As such, the species is protected in the USA, meaning that commercial expansion must take into consideration the levels of disturbance to the population before development or operation may proceed in a given area. This has led to US Fish and Wildlife guidelines for businesses such as coal mining companies and wind farms (e.g., US Fish and Wildlife Service 2012) that describe development without harming local wildlife, such as Indiana bat populations. In a recent case against a wind energy company in West Virginia that failed to perform a due-diligence survey prior to development, the courts ordered an injunction against the company and required that it apply for incidental take permits before continuing operations. The wind turbines were allowed to be powered on only in the winter when the bats were hibernating (Woody 2009). In another case, a bat habitat restoration project has"

260,133,0.358,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"One of the perplexing characteristics of ranavirus epidemics is the variation in the outcome, from no (apparent) mortality to massive die-offs. This apparent ârandomnessâ has led to the hypothesis that environmental factors, which can vary a great deal in space and time, may play an important role in disease outbreaks (Gray et al. 2009a). Natural and anthropogenic stressors are broadly thought to suppress immune function, making individuals in stressful environments more susceptible to infection and disease (reviewed in Martin 2009; Blaustein et al. 2012). Although many researchers use the term âstressâ to mean any aversive, generally unpredictable condition that would seem to challenge the organisms, there is a physiological basis to the âstress-induced susceptibilityâ hypothesis. It posits that chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoid âstressâ hormones have negative impacts on the immune system, such as reducing circulating lymphocyte populations, decreasing cytokine production, or suppressing cell-mediated immune responses (Sheridan et al. 1994; Haddad et al. 2002; Dhabhar 2009). Defining stress and identifying stressors and the responses they elicit a priori, however, is often difficult, particularly in the absence of detailed information on the environmental, developmental, and evolutionary context of the organisms (Martin 2009). For example, Warne et al. (2011) found that pro-metamorphic wood frog tadpoles challenged with a ranavirus had elevated glucocorticoid concentrations relative to controls and also experienced faster development and more rapid weight loss. As glucocorticoids are responsible for mobilizing resources (e.g., to respond to infection) as well as accelerating metamorphosis in pro-metamorphic tadpoles, the authors hypothesized that this surge in glucocorticoids led to an energetic trade-off. Only those individuals with large enough energetic reserves could support rapid development and a robust immune response at the same time (Warne et al. 2011). Clearly, linking elevated glucocorticoid concentrations to immunocompetence is fraught with difficulties, even with considerable context. It is thus not surprising that the reported effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on host susceptibility to ranaviruses are highly variable."

376,650,0.358,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Abstract On rangelands the livestockâwildlife interface is mostly characterized by management actions aimed at controlling problems associated with competition, disease, and depredation. Wildlife communities (especially the large vertebrate species) are typically incompatible with agricultural development because the opportunity costs of wildlife conservation are unaffordable except in arid and semiarid regions. Ecological factors including the provision of supplementary food and water for livestock, together with the persecution of large predators, result in livestock replacing wildlife at biomass densities far exceeding those of indigenous ungulates. Diseases are difficult to eradicate from free-ranging wildlife populations and so veterinary controls usually focus on separating commercial livestock herds from wildlife. Persecution of large carnivores due to their depredation of livestock has caused the virtual eradication of apex predators from most rangelands. However, recent research points to a broad range of solutions to reduce conflict at the livestockâwildlife interface. Conserving wildlife bolsters the adaptive capacity of a rangeland by providing stakeholders with options for dealing with environmental change. This is contingent upon local communities being empowered to benefit directly from their wildlife resources within a management framework that integrates land-use sectors at the landscape scale. As rangelands undergo irreversible changes caused by species invasions and climate forcings, the future perspective favors a proactive shift in attitude towards the livestockâwildlife interface, from problem control to asset management."

The wide range of environmental conditions occurring in tracks, led to the presence of a large number of nectar plant species, allowing the existence of many butterfly species, from those selecting dry and warm microhabitats to forest specialists (Kalarus and BÄkowski 2015). Similar results have been found for other pollinators due to the high diversity of bee forage flora, although their diversity is higher in lines with intermediate trafï¬c volume, and differs between microhabitats within the embankments (WrzesieÅ et al. 2016). On the contrary, Cerboncini et al. (2016) found no effects of railway edge on microclimate in a Brazilian Atlantic forest, probably because railway track was narrow and the forest was well developed. Finally, especially in more impacted landscapes, there is an opportunity to integrate old tracks once they are abandoned into the regional conservation schema. They can act, for instance, as habitat corridors among protected areas, as many of their new usesâlike rail-cycle or hikingâare wildlife-friendly activities. However, much more research is needed on the conservation potential of abandoned tracks as well as on cost-effective maintenance methods, like the weeding by domestic animals used in France (Orthlieb 2016). Also in France, Kerbiriou et al. (2015) found a strong increase in the population of hibernating pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in a railway tunnel as a result of the end of the exploitation of the railway line, remarking on the idea that abandoned railway structures can have second-life fulï¬lling conservation purposes."
230,137,0.358,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"4.4 Ingestion of Plastic Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is less visible than entanglement. Table 4.2 and Online Supplement 1 show that ingestion of plastic debris has currently been documented for 100 % of marine turtles (7 of 7 species), 59 % of whales (47 of 80), 36 % of seals (12 of 33), and 40 % of seabirds (164 of 406). In comparison to the review by Laist (1997) the number of bird + turtle + mammal species with known ingestion of plastics increased from 143 (33 %) to 233 (44 %). Studies on the ingestion of plastics by fish and invertebrates are largely a recent development. Currently, low proportions of fish and invertebrate species are presented in the tables, but a rapid increase in publications and species numbers are expected in this currently dynamic field of research. Records of plastic ingestion date back to the early days of plastic production in the 1960s. One of the first birds recorded to contain plastic was Leachâs storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) off New Foundland in 1962 (Rothstein 1973). The first report of a leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) with plastic dates back to 1968 (Mrosovsky et al. 2009). While the first record of anthropogenic debris in sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) was a fish hook found in a stomach in 1895, the first report of ingested plastic in sperm whales dates back to 1979 (de Stephanis et al. 2013). The first fish feeding on plastic was published in 1972 (Carpenter et al. 1972). The ingestion of plastics became a more commonly reported phenomenon from the 1970s onwards (Kenyon and Kridler 1969; Crockett and Reed 1976; Bourne and Imber 1982; Furness 1983; Day et al. 1985). A trend for birds ingesting plastic was probably first noted by Harper and Fowler (1987). Between 1958 and 1959 they found no plastic in prions (Pachyptila spp.) but from then on there was an upward trend in plastic consumption until 1977. A peak of plastic ingestion was detected in 1985 and 1995 in a number of long-term studies (Moser and Lee 1992; Robards et al. 1995; Spear et al. 1995; Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Van Franeker et al. 2011). In contrast to the continuing growth of global plastic use and increase in marine activities, the trend of plastic consumption decreased and stabilized from 2000 onwards approaching the 1980s level (Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Van Franeker et al."

230,28,0.356,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"1.4 Shifting Focus to the North Pacific Ocean Indications that the North Pacific was a hot spot for plastic litter date back to Kenyon and Kridlerâs (1969) paper on plastic ingestion by Laysan albatross. Subsequently, Bond (1971) found plastic pellets in all 20 red phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) examined when many individuals of this species came ashore along the coasts of southern California and Mexico in 1969. The birds apparently starved due to a shortage of surface plankton, and some were observed feeding along the strand line where plastic pellets were abundant (Bond 1971). It was unclear whether this had contributed to the high incidence of plastic in these birds, but Connors and Smith (1982) found plastic in six of seven red phalaropes killed by colliding with powerlines on their northward migration in central California. Birds with large volumes of ingested plastic had smaller fat reserves, raising concerns that ingested plastic reduced digestive efficiency or meal size. Baltz and Morejohn (1976) reported plastic in nine species of seabirds stranded in Monterey Bay, central California, during 1974â1975. All individuals of two species contained plastic: northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris). Industrial pellets predominated in these birds, but they were also found to contain pieces of food wrap, foamed polystyrene, synthetic sponge and pieces of rigid plastic. Baltz and Morejohn (1976) speculated that having large volumes of plastic in their stomachs could interfere with the birdsâ digestion, although they considered that toxic chemicals adsorbed to the plastics posed the greatest threat to bird health. Ohlendorf et al. (1978) showed that plastic ingestion also occurred among Alaskan seabirds. In the same year that Colton et al. (1974) showed the ubiquitous nature of plastic particles floating in the northwest Atlantic, Wong et al. (1974) reported that plastic pellets were widespread in the North Pacific Ocean. Sampling in 1972, they found that pellets occurred at lower densities (average 300 g kmâ2) than tar balls, but they outnumbered tar balls northeast of Hawaii, with up to 34,000 pellets kmâ2 (3500 g kmâ2). Even before this, however, Venrick et al. (1973) had shown that large litter items, at least half of which were made of plastic, were commonly encountered in the North Pacific gyre northeast of Hawaii (roughly 4.2 items kmâ2) in the area of the now notorious âNorth Pacific Garbage Patchâ. This is where Moore et al. (2001) recorded densities of more than"

Horn flies also promote livestock-avoidance behaviors, such as walking and tail switching (Harvey and Launchbaugh 1982). These additional activities and energy expenditures directly contribute to reduced livestock performance. Ticks (Amblyomma americanum Koch) reduce weight gains of British breeds, such as Hereford, by greater than 30 % (Byford et al. 1992). By contrast, ticks have less effect on Brahman crosses with British and Continental cattle, and little, if any, effect on Brahman cattle (Utech et al. 1978; George et al. 1985). Livestock gains in Australia could decrease by greater than 18 % because of increased tick infestations associated with climate change unless European and British cattle breeds are replaced by Brahmans or other tick-resistant breeds (White 2003). Climate change drivers also are anticipated to reduce livestock performance on many rangelands by reducing forage quantity, quality, or both (Polley et al. 2013). Drought obviously reduces forage production, whereas elevated CO2 has consistently been shown to increase plant C:N ratios and decrease tissue N concentrations (Cotrufo et al. 1998; Morgan et al. 2001), resulting in forage with reduced crude protein levels. Forage digestibility often declines at elevated CO2 (Morgan et al. 2004a; Milchunas et al. 2005). Regional-scale analyses indicate that livestock become more nutrient limited in warmer and drier climates as both dietary crude protein and digestible organic matter content of forages decrease (Craine et al. 2010). A 4-year study in the tallgrass prairie showed that warming reduced N concentration and, correspondingly, crude protein levels of live and dormant forage from five warm-season grasses (An et al. 2005). In the absence of protein supplementation, cattle production will decline if forage quality declines too greatly because forage intake is volume limited.

36,718,0.354,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Cave-dwelling bats are especially vulnerable to harvesting for consumption and trade due to their aggregation into these confined spaces. Reviews of global patterns in bat hunting for bushmeat indicate that this is common in the Old World tropics, but with possible exceptions, does not appear to be widespread or having a significant effect in other regions (Mickleburgh et al. 2009; Mildenstein et al. 2016). Though a problem in Madagascar and in many African countries, the threat to cavedwelling bats appears to be most widespread and acute in the Asian tropics, where bat harvesters target many species. For instance, Hall et al. (2002) reported dramatic declines in E. spelaea and the greater naked bat (Cheiromeles torquatus) during their successive surveys of Niah caves, Sarawak compared with numbers recorded in earlier surveys by Medway (1958) and attribute this to hunting for human consumption. While Asian hunters often target species that are large, colonial and/or abundant (e.g. E. spelaea, Rousettus spp., C. torquatus, C. plicatus and bent-winged bats Miniopterus spp.), smaller bats are also taken and harvesting activities are highly likely to negatively affect other species sharing the same caves (Hutson et al. 2001; Mickleburgh et al. 2009). Given the scale and severity of bushmeat hunting on bats, there is a pressing need for research on sustainable harvesting. Despite its widespread occurrence, accounts of the impact of guano harvesting upon cave-dwelling bats appear to remain largely anecdotal. This may stem in part from the difficulty of accurately monitoring large bat colonies, although rates of guano accumulation and harvesting records reflect their size (Fig. 15.9)."
230,235,0.354,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"same region. Lepadid barnacles seem to have species-specific preferences for litter of certain size, and some species (Lepas pectinata and Dosima fascicularis) associated with smaller litter items develop morphological adaptations, such as a small body size and light-weight valves, that minimize the risk of sinking of colonized flotsam (Whitehead et al. 2011). A size-specific selection of floating substrata has previously been shown for lepadid barnacles rafting on tar pellets (Minchin 1996). Abiotic and biotic flotsam differ in their expected longevity. The persistence of biotic flotsam, such as floating seaweeds, is clearly limited by physical factors such as temperature and biological processes such as consumption and decomposition (Vandendriessche et al. 2007; RothÃ¤usler et al. 2009). Therefore, the longevity of floating macroalgae is in the range of a few weeks up to six months (Thiel and Gutow 2005b). Floating litter is of no nutritional value for metazoans, and so far only few microorganisms have been shown capable of plastic digestion (Zettler et al. 2013). Accordingly, biological degradation is slow and marine litter, especially plastic, is expected to persist for years or even centuries in the marine environment (Derraik 2002; OâBrine and Thompson 2010). Plastics are particularly persistent at sea because lower temperatures and oxygen levels decelerate decomposition processes (Andrady 2011). Attached biota may protect the raft from degradation through solar radiation (Winston et al. 1997), thereby further extending its lifetime. Estimating the time a floating item has spent in the marine environment is complicated and at present no reliable method exists. Age estimations for floating litter are inferred from (a) drift trajectories and velocities based on the supposed origin of the items (Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham 1992; Rees and Southward 2009; Hoeksema et al. 2012), (b) the successional stage of the rafting community (Cundell 1974), (c) the size of rafting organisms of known growth rates, e.g. bryozoans or lepadid barnacles (Stevens 1992 cited by Winston et al. 1997; Barnes and Fraser 2003; Tsikhon-Lukanina et al. 2001), or (d) the degradation of the substratum, for example by measuring the tensile extensibility of the material (Andrady 2011). However, all these methods have drawbacks, introducing a high degree of uncertainty to age estimates for floating litter. The sources of litter items are often unknown and floating velocities can be highly variable due to seasonal variations in wind and current conditions. Additionally, the composition and the successional stage of the rafting community may change the floating behavior of a litter item. Biological interactions such as predation and competition may influence the composition and the age structure of a rafting community rendering the size of specific rafting organisms an unreliable predictor of the duration of the floating period. Moreover, unlike floating macroalgae, abiotic flotsam may repeatedly return to the sea even after extended periods on the shore, which likely influences the state of degradation of the raft as well as the composition of the associated biota. Bravo et al. (2011) discussed that degradation of marine litter may either facilitate colonization by producing more rugose surfaces or alternatively impede it by abrasion processes. Overall, degradation and fragmentation of litter items into smaller pieces reduces the size of individual rafts, thereby changing settlement opportunities for species of a certain size range. Removal of floating litter rafts from the sea surface occurs through stranding, sinking or ingestion by aquatic animals. Sinking of litter rafts mostly occurs because"

231,178,0.353,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.5 Fisheries The North Sea ecosystem is overï¬shed (Cury et al. 2000; FAO 2012). Bottom and beam trawling are a major threat for marine organisms because they damage the seabed and alter mature benthic communities. Based on long-term data, Fock et al. (2014) stated that the age, volume and size composition of commercial ï¬sh stocks has shifted since 1902. As a result, species composition has shown signiï¬cant changes in recent decades. For example, slow-reproducing ï¬sh such as sharks and rays declined and may only be encountered in areas with low ï¬shing density. With beam trawling, the benthic community structure has changed from long-lived species (e.g. sharks and rays) to short-lived opportunistic and scavenging species (e.g. crabs and shrimps). Seagrasses declined along the Dutch, German and Danish coasts as a result of bottom trawling ï¬sheries and an epidemic of wasting disease in the 1930s. Exploitation of North Sea ï¬sh stocks has increased since 1945 as shown by trends in ï¬shery mortality among all groups of exploited ï¬sh species (Daan et al. 1990). As a result of measures to allow ï¬sh stocks to recover, total catches have declined since the late 1960s (Fig. 1.37). Even though pollution and overï¬shing in the North Sea (CabeÃ§adas et al. 1999) have resulted in major changes in species composition and shifts in species distribution, species richness based on International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data has increased over the past 30 years (ICES 2008); see"

169,401,0.353,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"How to Regulate Fishing All management perspectives, conservational, economic, or ï¬sh-ecological, hold that ï¬shing regulations should primarily aim to preserve viable populations. Waters supporting healthy stocks need to be managed without stocking interventions but nevertheless can be harvested in a sustainable way following the necessary regulations (cf. Fig. 14.5): Fisheries regulations can protect the long-term productivity of river ecosystems and ï¬sh populations by taking ï¬sh following guidelines and catch limits set by natural production and, likewise, by releasing ï¬sh in size and age classes of limited availability. This follows investment principles of withdrawing only the interest while leaving the fund intact. However, if ï¬sh shall be released, it would be counterproductive to harm these ï¬sh. Therefore, it is mandatory to restrict the ï¬shing gear if management strategies aim to release certain species or size classes. The closer to a pristine habitat situation, i.e., a very good status according to the WFD, the stricter must be the formulation and implementation of regulations regarding gear restrictions and angling pressure (see below). Examples of good practices to minimize hooking mortality include the use of barbless hooks, bait that canât be swallowed, or the minimization of handling procedures of ï¬shes dedicated to release. Regarding ï¬sh handling ethical sound practices have to be mandatory in any case. The example of sustainable harvest in the river Ois represents more than a concept or slogan. It is a realistic management option. On the other hand, at least from an ethical point of view, pure âcatch-and-releaseâ (releasing all caught individuals) is questionable. While it can make sense to release all individuals of a threatened species or to preserve a small stock or population, pure âcatch-andreleaseâ regulations are hard to explain to people who generally conceive of angling as cruel. If people go ï¬shing with the intention to release their entire catch, they are indeed playing with creatures, which is hardly acceptable for animal welfare proponents, irrespective of the debate as to whether ï¬sh feel pain or not (Braithwaite 2010; Rose et al. 2014). Our view is that ï¬shing can and should be a reasonable pastime as long as we aim at ï¬nessing, catching, and taking home healthy and tasty food, as the human race has done for millennia, provided that modesty ï¬nds its way into the understanding of the way natural resources are used. In this context, a further regulatory lever comes into play: angling pressure. Angling pressure can be expressed by days or hours of angling per river length or water surface area. As it can be quantiï¬ed, so can it be restricted. Limiting angling pressure means that ï¬sh are caught less frequently. This helps to avoid learning effects and reduces timidity, which supports angler satisfaction as it will be easier to hook a ï¬sh compared to intensively ï¬shed beats. Furthermore, limited angling pressure reduces insurance rates and, consequently, hooking mortality. According to Fig. 14.5, speciï¬cally near-natural habitats have to be protected from overï¬shing to meet conservational requirements, while altered or artiï¬cial water bodies, where in many cases stocking will be a frequently used management tool, can also be burdened with higher pressure. The general scheme of adjusting ï¬shing regulations to ï¬t the ecological status of water bodies can be used to guide anglers and therefore also angling pressure (Fig. 14.5). Near-natural streams have to be managed and ï¬shed appropriate to conservational requirements, while"
291,90,0.353,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The patterns observed in the three panels at the bottom of Fig. 9.1 deviate from the ones for circulatory and respiratory diseases above. Motor vehicle accidents do not peak in winter but around July and August. Many people assume that the reason for the peak in all-cause mortality is due to suicides in winter. The middle panel at the bottom of Fig. 9.1 illustrates why this assumption is wrong for three reasons: (1) The seasonal pattern is less pronounced for suicide than for other causes. (2) If one can speak of a seasonal pattern at all, the peak occurs definitely not during winter. (3) The 30,000 observed deaths are less than 1.5% of all deaths; not enough to shape the pattern for all causes. Lung cancer, whose impact on mortality in the United States was discussed in previous chapters, isâlike many malignant neoplasmsâan example of no or only negligible seasonality. Figure 9.1 displays an aggregated picture of monthly deaths. In our analysis we want to investigate, however, whether the seasonal pattern for selected causes of death differs by age as well as whether the seasonal pattern changed over calendar time. The multiplicative model2 suggested by Eilers et al. (2008) to decompose seasonal data allows such an analysis. The model is, at its core, another application of smoothing data via P-splines (Eilers and Marx 1996) as in Chap. 5. It is rather flexible since it allows the estimation not only of counts but also of rates. Exposures are then included as log offsets if the latter is desired, similar to Camardaâs approach (2012, 2015) employed in Chaps. 5, 6, and 7. We use the model in its most simple form: The model is estimating counts assuming an annual unimodal pattern in the data. Not allowing for bimodal patterns or even higher frequencies should not induce any problems in our analysis since the causes in which we are interested in feature clear patterns with one peak and one trough (see Fig. 9.1). We model the expected value of death counts y over age a and time t, ta D E.yta /, to be Poisson distributed using a log-link function log .ta / D vta C fta cos .!t/ C gta sin .!t/ with ! D 2=p, where p is the period. In our case of monthly values p D 12. Further technical details are given in Eilers et al. (2008). The estimation yields three smooth matrices/surfaces, vta for the trend as well as the smooth cosine and sine surfaces fta and gta . The trend surface captures any major changes in the overall pattern that could be caused by varying population sizes, survival improvements, competing risks . . . . We are mainly not interested in this trend surface nor in the the actual sine and cosine surfaces. The two latter surfaces allow us, however, to obtain an estimate for the amplitude and the phase over age and time via simple trigonometric functions. The latter denotes the location of the annual peak of the death counts and is expressed in the difference in days from the 1st of January; i.e., a value of 30 corresponds to late January whereas -30 indicates that mortality is highest in the beginning of December."

Thus, large stretches of streams and rivers far from the point source of contamination pose threats to bats and other aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Bats are also known to fly and possibly forage/drink over gold mines in Australia (Donato and Smith 2007; Smith et al. 2008). High bat activity was recorded over gold mine water bodies containing cyanide (Griffiths et al. 2014a). Griffiths et al. (2014b) suggested that elevated salt levels in water bodies at gold mines may decrease bat activity, foraging, and drinking. Bats, including the Vulnerable (IUCN 2014) ghost bat, Macroderma gigas, have also been recorded around an Australian copper mine in the Great Sandy Desert, although the mineâs effects on individuals or the population is unknown (Read 1998). Africa is rich in mineral resources and this makes mining activities relatively common so likely a serious threat to water quality and therefore to bats. A matter of grave concern is that no research has been done in Africa in this regard. This situation prevails despite evidence that mining activities do pollute surface water in Africa (Olade 1987; Naicker et al. 2003)."

347,101,0.352,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"In 2002, the EUâs CFP underwent a substantial reform process aimed to ensure sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources. This was a landmark shift in EU fisheries governance. Since then, the conceptual basis for fisheries management under CFP is the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) principle, the precautionary approach and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Key elements of this reform include (EC 2002): â The adherence to the precautionary approach to protect and conserve living aquatic resources and to minimise the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems â Adoption of a more long-term approach to fisheries management involving the establishment of multi-annual recovery plans for stocks outside safe biological limits and of multi-annual management plans for others stocks â Reduction of fishing effort as a fundamental tool in fisheries management, notably in the context of multi-annual recovery plans â Aim to progressively implement an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management â Increased involvement of the fisheries industry and other groups affected by CFP through the creation of stakeholder-led Regional Advisory Councils Interviewees suggested that the move to a long-term approach to fisheries management has mitigated (or has potential to mitigate) conflict around TAC levels between scientists and conservation groups on the one hand and fishers and managers on the other hand. This conflict arose because management decisions in the past usually were only âmoderately responsive to ICES advice in setting TACsâ (Patterson and RÃ©simont 2007). Generally, ICES advice is an answer to the question: âHow much fish can we take this year without running the risk of not having enough left over for long-term exploitation?â (cf. Wilson 2009: 10). Over the last two decades, as Wilson argues, the TAC finally decided upon by the Council of Ministers is close to but not as much as ICES has advised. According to scientists, conservation groups and also Commission staff interviewed, the TACs decided upon are not based on carefully weighted biological and social and economic considerations. Instead, they claim that the divergence is due to putting short-term economic and social interests before long-term ecological imperatives. Short-term decision-making along with poor enforcement is seen as the main cause for increased stock depletion risk and economic risks for fisheries and fishers, an issue exhaustively discussed in the scientific literature (cf. Aps and Lassen 2010; Villassante et al. 2011). Over the last 15 years, despite the growing importance of sustainable development, it is believed by many including the media that scientific advice has largely been ignored in European fisheries (Wilson 2009: 28). In recent years, however, there is some indication that TAC decisions by the Council of Ministers have been more in line with scientific advice. As a result, the percentage of European stocks considered as overfished has declined (Lassen 2009, p. 6; EC 2012)."

While fish eggs have their own food supply, fish larvae eat smaller plankton; both serve as an important prey base for marine invertebrates and fish. The distribution of ichthyoplankton is a function of the spawning locations of adult fish, currents, and sea-surface temperatures. Monitoring ichthyoplankton provides essential information on potential population sizes of adult fish since the survival rates of larval fish are assumed to contribute to recruitment success and year-class strength in adults (Houde 1997; Fuiman and Werner 2002; SWFSC 2007). 7.4.1.3.1"

255,273,0.351,Railway Ecology,"Introduction Many animals range widely across landscapes in the quest to meet their daily, seasonal and annual biological needs of food, water, shelter and mates (Caughley and Sinclair 1994). Habitat connectivity within a landscape helps dispersal and re-colonization, thus maintaining regional metapopulations and minimizing risks of inbreeding within populations (Newmark 1987; Wilcove et al. 1998). Historically, the spread of agriculture probably contributed the most to loss and fragmentation of their natural habitat. In an increasingly industrialized world, however, transport networks (railways, roads, and waterways) or so-called âlinear infrastructures,â restrict the movement of wildlife populations by fragmenting their habitat, increasing edge effects, constricting ecological corridors, blocking animal movement, and increasing the risk of mortality due to direct collisions with motorized vehicles (Forman and Deblinger 2000; Trombulak and Frissell 2000; Inell et al. 2003; Van der Ree et al. 2011). These processes hinder the persistence of species in human-dominated landscapes because small and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction from stochastic demographic processes and loss of genetic variation (Soule and Wilcox 1980). Roads are perhaps the most widespread and pervasive form of âlinear infrastructureâ that have greatly impacted wildlife populations in the more developed parts of the world through habitat loss, restriction of animal movements, alteration of animal behaviour, and directly injuring or killing very large numbers of animals in collisions with vehicles (Trombulak and Frissell 2000; Seiler and Helldin 2015). A variety of animals are involved in roadâkills, from large-bodied ones such as moose to smaller creatures such as frogs (Fahrig et al. 1995; Formann et al. 2003; Dorans et al. 2012). One estimate of roadâkills suggested that 1,000,000 vertebrates were killed in the USA every day (Lalo 1987), while Conover et al. (1995) estimated that the number of deerâvehicle collisions in the USA exceeds 1,000,000 annually, causing approximately 29,000 human injuries and 200 fatalities, apart from animal fatalities. Given the magnitude of animal roadâkills and the occurrence of human fatalities, there has been much attention paid to mitigating wildlife road kills through the appropriate design of roadways in many developed countries (Clarke et al. 1998; Inell et al. 2003). In contrast, only limited attention has been paid to wildlifeâtrain collisions, although this has also been happening on signiï¬cant scales in many countries. For instance, 200 moose train collisions were estimated in the province of British Columbia, Canada, during 1988â1990 (Child et al. 1991), with 266 collisions in a 92 km section of railways in Norway during 1980â 1988 (Andersen et al. 1991), and between 9 and 725 collisions annually in Alaska (Modafferi 1991). Similarly, 69 roe deer train collisions in the Czech Republic were reported during 2009 (Kusta et al. 2014). Therefore, there is an urgent need for more information on trainâwildlife collisions, and how these may be mitigated. India is one of the countries with serious problems of trainâwildlife collisions. This is because the Indian Railways (IR) is one of the worldâs largest railway networks, comprising 115,000 km of tracks over a route of about 65,000 km and"

36,526,0.35,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.7.3 Education/Outreach Education and outreach in local communities is essential to successful hunting management campaigns. Many hunters do not perceive bats as a limited resource and are unaware of the effect they may be having on bat speciesâ extinction risks. An obvious first step to bat conservation in hunted areas is therefore the dissemination of information on the bat population size, basic biology, and monitoring techniques, so that hunters can assess the impacts they are having. Local communities should understand the benefits of bats and the valuable ecological services they provide, including their contribution to forest regeneration through seed dispersal. Communities that appreciate bats may be more likely to pursue conservation management. If people understand the array of risks of ignoring declining populations, they will be more inclined to exert effort to protect bats. Local communities should also understand the human health risks of bat hunting and consumption. Bat handling, trade, preparation, and consumption by humans create a direct transmission route for disease spillover into human communities and warrants consideration in bat protection programs. Education about these risks is needed, as only a small percentage of participants in bat hunting and"
376,662,0.35,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","together with wild ungulates in East Africa during the wet season they achieve higher weight gains than in foraging areas from which wild ungulates are excluded (Odadi et al. 2011). That is probably because zebras (Equus quagga), being comparatively large hind-gut fermenters, reduce the stem:leaf ratio in the sward and thereby facilitate conditions for grazing ruminants such as cattle. Even though competition occurs in the dry season, weight gains from the facilitative effect in the wet season are sufficient that a net benefit might be achievable with management. In theory, managers could impose seasonal shifts in both the foraging areas used by livestock (currently common) and the mixes of livestock and wildlife species foraging together in each season and area (currently uncommon). In practice, however, there are few areas of rangeland in which livestock and wildlife can be actively managed together in a commercial operation at the landscape scale. Yet there are mounting scientific arguments in favor of selectively exploiting the diverse functional properties of wildlife species (du Toit 2011), despite the barriers of command-and-control laws and societal inertia. The megafaunal extinctions that occurred on all continents other than Africa in the late Quaternary Period are attributed to a suite of factors that include overhunting by humans (Brook and Bowman 2004). Now, introducing morphologically and ecologically similar surrogatesâmostly from Africaâhas been proposed to restore the ecosystem processes once driven by those now-extinct megaherbivores in North America (Donlan et al. 2005) and Australia (Bowman 2012). Those ârewildingâ proposals are contentious because benchmark conditions of archaic ecosystems are unknown, the global climate is continually changing, and the practicalities are prohibitive (Rubenstein et al. 2006). Also, sociopolitical acceptance of the rewilding argument requires a leap of faith in the net benefits of quasi-Pleistocene assemblages replete with large predators and megaherbivores (SoulÃ© and Noss 1998). Nevertheless, âhybridâ or ânovelâ ecosystems (Hobbs et al. 2009) are emerging all the time mainly as a result of unintended species invasions and climate change, as well as the intended engineering activities of humans. For example, in the Netherlands 6000 ha of grazing land was created from seabed less than 50 years ago and is now a popular wildlife refuge called Oostvaardersplassen (Marris 2009). The bold approach adopted there was to stock the area with relict breeds of cattle and horses, together with indigenous cervids, lagomorphs, and waterfowl that moved in, and allow competitive and facilitative interactions to play out through time. With minimal intervention from managers, Oostvaardersplassen now supports one of Western Europeâs richest terrestrial faunas occupying a patchwork of grassland, woodland, and wetland habitats. Those plant communities were established naturally, mainly from seeds brought in by birds, and the landscapeâs heterogeneity is maintained by interactions among top-down and bottom-up processes operating through herbivory, the climate, and soil. The ongoing global changes that define the Anthropocene epoch (Zalasiewicz et al. 2010) mean that the reference state of an ecosystem cannot be an historic condition, but is the most desired of the potential alternative states at some"

People drew on both of the two interpretive frames described above: students expressed simultaneously a professional concern about offending their hostsâ sensibilities and an individual anxiety about personal spiritual harm. For these second year students, the death brought back bad memories of their own first year trip to Barowagi in neighboring Simbu Province. Though no one from the college had been near the vehicle at the time, they had been blamed when a local manâs car was destroyed, their tutor accused of causing the crash with her âhard words.â Ellen told me the story of the car crash during an interview. Their tutor, who had retired by the time of my fieldwork, had lost her temper with the pastor in Barowagi who was hosting them. One day she âpressurizedâ (presaraisim) the pastor. We went there in the dry season. The little creek we bathed in was dry, and we had to go to the big river [far away]. No water to cook either. This [tutor] went and yelled at the pastor and said, âYou people, you donât recognize when a good thing comes inside your community. If you take visitors in, you must provide for all their needs. We want to cook and itâs hard. You go get water at the big river and fill up this water tank so we can cook.â She pressurized this pastor and [because] he was a pastor, he had trouble responding in this [same] kind of aggressive wayâ¦ with anger inside him he borrowed the car from a local man. â¦ And he crashed into an ironwood tree in the coffee garden. The community came and cried, cried, came from the hamlet, came crying, crying. The carâs owner cried for his car. They cried for the pastor, he was a village leader. All of them were crying and I was really afraid! Now they came and said, âWhy did you cause our man to go and do this? Why donât you settle down (stap isi)?â"
97,110,0.348,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","There is still considerable need for fundamental research on the ecological characteristics that could mitigate the effects of extreme events and climate change. Sound ecological knowledge is the first building block for understanding how to design NBS to meet different needs. These needs can be understood as the âdemandâ for protection, and are very much determined by socioeconomic factors and cannot be captured by a biophysical assessment alone. An ecologically suitable NBS will only deliver expected solutions if it is sufficiently sized and adequately located (cf. Andersson et al. 2015). The answers to both these questions need to be sought in the larger social-ecological system â as is clearly demonstrated by the literature on vulnerability and exposure (e.g. Adger et al. 2005; Folke 2006). According to IPCC âvulnerability describes a set of conditions of people that derive from the historical and prevailing cultural, social, environmental, political, and economic contextsâ and âthe propensity of exposed elements such as human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard eventsâ (IPCC 2012, p. 71 and p. 69, respectively), while exposure refers to an âinventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occurâ (ibid., p. 69). While the literature and common usage sometimes conflate the two they do capture different aspects. To be vulnerable you must be exposed to the risk, but exposure alone is not sufficient. Awareness of exposure together with appropriately planned and implemented adaptation measures may at least reduce the vulnerability of people and property. If NBS are to contribute to making communities less vulnerable they must be sized to match the magnitude of the disturbance and the extent of the exposed area. For example, bioswales and other types of green infrastructure being employed around the world in cities to provide NBS for mitigating surface flooding may fail if overwhelmed by large or extreme precipitation or flood events. Second, they need to be located in the right place. There are several possible spatial relationships between the source of the insurance capacity â the NBS â and where people and property may benefit from it (see e.g. Fisher et al. 2009; Renaud et al. 2016). Most usually, the insurance is achieved by the NBS providing a âbufferâ between the exposed area and the potential risk, e.g. wetlands upstream or along the coast outside a city (see Haase 2017, Chap. 7, this volume). This connection between the NBS and their beneficiaries is mediated by social structures such as built infrastructure"

Species that are adapted to finer and organic-rich sediments characterize the Mississippi Estuarine and Texas Estuarine Ecoregions, while some species in the Eastern Gulf Neritic Ecoregion and South Florida/ Bahamian Atlantic Ecoregion are associated primarily with biogenic sediments on the West Florida Shelf and Campeche Banks in the Southern GoM Ecoregion. A faunal break has been described between the Eastern Gulf Neritic and Mississippi Estuarine Ecoregions (as defined by the DeSoto Canyon), but changes in species distributions are less abrupt in most other areas of the Gulf. Coastal habitat epifauna and infauna play an important role in the trophic dynamics of GoM ecosystems. They exhibit a wide range of feeding strategies and are critical to the conversion of vegetative detritus available to higher trophic levels. Few of these taxa are migratory; rather they are typically sedentary or have limited ranges of movement. As a result, their abundance and diversity serve as ideal indicators of habitat quality and perturbation. Nekton are characterized by their mobility, and their assemblages in the regionâs vegetated marine habitats are a subset of the fishes, natant crustaceans, molluscs, marine reptiles, and marine mammals found along the beaches, bays, lagoons, and tidal channels of the GoM. It is difficult to describe a characteristic nekton assemblage for individual marine habitats because the habitat of many nekton species includes multiple types of coastal wetlands; species richness and abundance are often greatest at the boundaries (i.e., edges) between subtidal (e.g., embayments) and intertidal (e.g., salt marshes) wetland habitats. A few species like bay anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli, are ubiquitous in almost every coastal marine habitat within the GoM (Figure 6.108), while others like zostera shrimp, Hippolyte zostericola, and dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zostericola, are closely associated with specific habitats such as subtidal seagrass beds (Figure 6.107). The relatively few species (e.g., fishes in the families Fundulidae and Cyprinodontidae and shrimps in genus Palaemonetes) that are abundant year-round residents of intertidal vegetated marine habitats in the northern GoM (Figure 6.106) are adapted to the wide range of environmental conditions typical of temperate intertidal estuaries. Many other species (e.g., penaeid shrimps, Gulf menhaden) are seasonally abundant as a result of life histories that involve the use of shallow coastal wetlands as nurseries by juvenile life stages (Figures 6.103 and 6.108) during seasons when environmental conditions are favorable for their survival and growth. Overall, nekton assemblages connect vegetated marine habitats across the coastal landscape of the GoM by facilitating significant energy transformations and production transfers among coastal wetland habitats and from estuaries to nearshore coastal marine environments via either diel, tidal, and ontogenetic migrations (e.g., penaeid shrimps, Gulf menhaden) or size-structured predatorâprey interactions. Greatest changes in coastal marine habitats occur in areas most susceptible to relative sea-level rise, tropical cyclones, and human disturbances. As such, the deltaic coast of Louisiana has experienced the greatest land and habitat changes in the GoM. Conversely, the more stable coasts of the YucataÌn Peninsula, Cuba, and southwestern Florida have illustrated the least amount of change. Although vegetated marine habitats of the GoM are quite productive, human disturbances are recognized in areas of significant industrial activity and tourism. Human impacts are in large part tied to periodic and chronic stressors and disturbances associated with urban, agricultural, and industrial activities. The draining and filling of wetlands for human habitation, agricultural development, and industrial expansion have dramatically impacted coastal habitats throughout the GoM. Also, over-fishing and related activities have threatened important commercial fisheries in some areas of the Gulf. Other stressors such as nutrient enrichment, and resulting eutrophication and hypoxia, altered hydrology from multiple causes, invasive species, and chemical pollutants from agriculture and industry have challenged the health and sustainability of vegetated marine habitats.

389,320,0.348,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"Freshwater fish primarily accumulate radiocesium through the food chain rather than directly from the water (Williams and Pickering 1961; Hewett and Jefferies 1976; Yamamoto et al. 2014b). Species-specific food intake and food availability can cause differences in radiocesium concentrations among fish species. Because metals are concentrated in organisms as they are transferred up trophic levels by consumption, the trophic level of a fish is an important ecological factor affecting its concentration of radiocesium (Rowan and Rasmussen 1994). For example, after the Chernobyl accident in 1987, a higher annual mean concentration of 137Cs has been detected in fish from higher trophic levels in some lakes of Finland, including perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) (Rask et al. 2012). Okino (2002) showed that fishes classified as piscivorous, including salmonid fishes, the Japanese catfish Silurus asotus, and the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, occupy the top of the food chain in temperate lakes in Japan. We also categorized fish into two groups: (1) piscivorous fish (the white-spotted char Salvelinus leucomaenis pluvius, Japanese catfish, the smallmouth bass Micropterus"

140,159,0.347,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"wars, genocides, and political characteristics of nations (Wayman & Tago, 2004, 2010), we pored over Rummelâs valuable Statistics of Democide (Rummel, 1998). We have entries from Rummel 1998âe.g., for Japan 1937â45, Japanese war dead 2,521,000 (Rummel, 1998: 39), and 5,964,000 democide (Rummel, 1998: 46â47). We can divide them by the number of years (nine in this case), and arrive at a genocide and mass murder total of 662,667 per year. This would be true of COW data on a war, tooâthink of World War Iâbut it is a little trickier for Rummel. These data are often aggregated in Rummel (1998) into totals by regime, and, for instance, the USSR regime lasts from 1917 to the end of his dataset in 1987, and so it is time-consuming at best to break out the effects in different years (how many died, e.g., in 1954?) and by government (e.g., Stalin vs. Khrushchev). One could compare what Tago and I did with the Rolseth, Theisen & Gleditsch data, and then see if the beneï¬ts of more reï¬nements would warrant the costs. When the ï¬rst survey of IR scholars was done by Foreign Policy magazine, to assess who was most influential in their midst (Peterson, Tierney & Maliniak, 2005), Rummel did not make the top twenty-ï¬ve thinkers; Singer did. Citations to their work produce similar resultsâRummel a tad behind Singer. Realism, often claiming separation of domestic and international politics, was the only paradigm with more than one person in that top ï¬ve. Nothing could be more destructive of this realist claim than Rummelâs work on regimes, which shows that regime type matters (Wayman & Diehl, 1994). It is heartening to me that two people who continued Rummelâs investigation of the inter-democratic peace, Bruce Russett and Michael Doyle, did make the list of the top IR scholars. Apparently, evidence was making some headway in undermining old paradigms. This makes me recall the prediction of Anatol Rapoport, on the trajectory of the COW Project as it was being launched in 1963. Rapoport said to David Singer âwe were not likely to come up with an integrated explanatory theory of war, â¦ but at least we would lay to rest many of the foolish platitudes that had â¦ led too many nations into the brutal abyss of warâ (Singer paraphrasing Rapoport, in Sarkees & Wayman, 2010: xiii). The progress described in this essay, the progress of Rummelâs doing, was based on the opposite of realism on this point, namely, his insisting on the unity of the study of international and domestic politics, including an examination of the role of regime type in mass violenceâboth democide and the inter-democratic peace. When he took over from Singer as COW Director, Stuart Bremer convened a conference at Penn State University, on âFuture Wars and the Future Study of Warâ. Bremerâs keynote address (Bremer & Ghosn, 2003) focused on whether the COW deï¬nition of state was too restrictive, and proposed measuring two dimensions of statehood, autonomy (stamps, money, military forces, autonomous foreign policy, size of territory and of population) and recognition (treaties, diplomatic recognition, participation in international conferences and in IGOs)âmore as continuous variables than dichotomies. If done by COW, would this Herculean endeavor not make COW a âDONâ project? The non-state wars list of Sarkees & Wayman (2010) has hopefully been a helpful move in expanding our understanding of armed conflict beyond system members, but, just to take one example from that book, a list of all sovereign states"
231,161,0.347,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Merja Helena TÃ¶lle, Franciscus Colijn The semi-enclosed North Sea region is one of the biologically richest and most productive regions in the world (Emeis et al. 2015). Its ecosystem comprises a complex interplay between biological, chemical and physical compartments. Humans also play a major role in this system integrating social and economic activities (see Sect. 1.2). As is the case for most marine and coastal ecosystems the North Sea shows a high degree of natural variability, which hampers a distinction between human and natural causes of change. High nutrient loads from terrestrial and anthropogenic sources are one of the major contributors to the high levels of primary production in coastal waters. Fisheries and contaminant inputs constitute the main drivers of change in the North Sea biota. However, complex interactions within the food web make it difï¬cult to discriminate between the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors."
36,593,0.347,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"permit, and there are no seasons or limits to the numbers of permits that may be issued by a state in Peninsular Malaysia. In 1990, under the Protection of Wild Life Amendment Order, a bag limit was set that allowed 50 bats to be shot under a single permit and the time of hunting was limited to 0700â1200 h and 0500â 0700 h each day. Each licence costs MYR 25 (USD 8) (Teoh 2005). No other bats are listed. As in Australia, such a licensed hunting system is difficult to monitor and regulate. A study by Epstein et al. (2009) evaluated the abundance and roost distribution of P. vampyrus in Peninsular Malaysia, finding that the number of hunting licences issued had doubled since 1996, and concluded that current levels were unsustainable and likely to cause local extinction within 6â81 years. Further, these estimates of hunting pressure from licence data were likely to be an underestimate as they did not include illegal hunting, and there was also a provision in the 1972 Act that allowed killing, shooting or removal of an unspecified number of any wild animal that is âcausing damage or there is reason to believe that it is about to cause serious damage to crops, vegetables, fruit, growing timberâ¦if reasonable efforts to frighten away the wild animal have failedâ. The study by Epstein et al. (2009) was highlighted in the media (Burns 2009; Kandasamy 2009) and prompted a response from PERHILITAN that they would consider implementing a hunting ban as part of the then current review of the act. However, when the act was repealed in 2010 by the new Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 (Act 716), flying foxes had still not been moved from the âProtectedâ list to the âTotally Protectedâ list, meaning that licensed hunting is still permitted, and the provision for protecting crops (Part VI, sec 54) is also still permitted in the new legislation. In February 2012, following lobbying and recommendations from conservation research group Rimba, the Terengganu state government implemented a state-wide moratorium on hunting of flying foxes (Rimba 2012). Prior to this, the State of Johor had banned hunting of all wildlife when its Sultan issued a royal decree to this effect (Charles and Benjamin 2010). However, to date, no nation-wide hunting ban has been announced by PERHILITAN at the federal level, and other bat species remain unprotected. As in Peninsular Malaysia, in Sabah, the two flying fox species are currently listed under Schedule 3, sections 2, 25(2) as âProtected species of animals for which hunting licence is requiredâ under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment of 1997. However, there is no clear provision for shooting animals to protect crops without a licence, and no other bat species are legally protected. In Sarawak, research by Gumal et al. (1998) successfully resulted in all bat species in the state being listed as âProtectedâ in May 1998, under Part II of the Sarawak Wildlife Ordinance 1998 (with the exception of Cheiromeles torquatus that is listed in Part I, as âTotally Protectedâ). The Sarawak Forest Department does not allow legal bat hunting and has implemented some of the strictest policies in Malaysia to regulate guns and ammunition and decrease the extent of wildlife poaching."
151,175,0.347,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Three different United States Geological Survey (USGS) studies used the same pesticide concentration dataset (Martin and Eberle 2009) to examine trends in pesticide concentrations in corn-belt streams (Sullivan et al. 2009), urban streams (Ryberg et al. 2010), and streams of the western U.S. (Johnson et al. 2011).

255,100,0.347,Railway Ecology,"Physical barrier constraints mainly affect species of small size with reduced mobility, such as herptiles. For instance, Kornilev et al. (2006) reported that eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) in the USA enter a railway at crossings with roads (where surfaces are at the same level), but then become trapped between the rails as they are unable to climb over them, and ï¬nally die due to thermal stress. A study of Hermannâs tortoises (Testudo hermanni) in Romania found that the impossibility of overtaking obstacles (e.g., ditches with angles of over 60Â°) led to an increase in the distribution of railway-kills at the end of the ditches (Iosif 2012). Bumblebees (Bombus impatiens and B. afï¬nis) in the USA (Bhattacharya et al. 2003) provide an example of a species to which the railway is a behavioral barrier. These species are reluctant to cross railways (and roads) because of their high ï¬delity to their foraging site. In experiments, individuals of these species could come back to their patches of origin after being translocated, or could leave their patch when their food was removed, but these movements were rarely in-control (non-translocated) individuals (Bhattacharya et al. 2003). Bhattacharya et al. (2003) observed that foraging bees turned back when they reached the edge of a patch (i.e., bisected by a railway); thus, rather than physically impassable barriers to bumblebees, railways acted as barriers because they are likely to be strong landmarks. On the other hand, most of the translocated gatekeeper butterflies (Pyronia tithonus) crossed the French High Speed Rail (hereinafter âHSRâ) to return to their capture plot, as this species shows a strong homing behavior (Vandevelde et al. 2012; see also Chap. 16). Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) are able to cross fenced railways in Mongolia (Ito et al. 2008), but they usually do not do so (Ito et al. 2005, 2013, and see Chap. 14). Therefore, these fenced railways represented a barrier effect affecting population dynamics as it caused disruptions in long-distance gazelle migrations (Ito et al. 2005, 2008, 2013). Stopping migration routes prevents gazelles from reaching their traditional food-rich winter quarters, potentially increasing their winter mortality due to starvation (Ito et al. 2005, 2008, 2013). This conservation problem is compounded by the current climate change, as drought events reducing vegetation productivity could require gazelles to migrate longer distances, instead of the current average of 600 km (Olson et al. 2009). To date, railways do not seem to have been a barrier for gazelle gene flow, although this assertion should be explored with more suitable markers (Okada et al. 2012; see below). Although it has been less studied, the conservation threat of the critically endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) in Kazakhstanâas a consequence of migration disruption due to fenced railwaysâseems to be similar to that of Mongolian gazelles (Olson 2013; see also Olson and van der Ree 2015). In a study carried out in Sweden, Kammonen (2015) found that a motorway and a railway running in parallel acted as barriers for two bat species (whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus and Brandtâs bat M. brandtii) in a forest-dominated area. Although this author did not differentiate between these two infrastructures, she found that bats did not directly cross them; rather they used either the green bridge or the underpass both to cross it and to forage (Kammonen 2015)."

87,353,0.347,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","6.2.3.2 The Protective Role of Forests Forests fulfil important protective functions. In mountainous regions, they protect settlements, farms and infrastructure from avalanches and rockfalls. Due to the specific forest climate, which maintains soil humidity and thus enhances water infiltration rates, forests usually reduce surface runoff and erosion. The root network stabilizes the soil and acts as a buffer against landslides. Along streams, forests stabilize river banks and often serve as water (and sediment) retention areas during periods of flooding. In the tropics, mangroves have a protective role on shorelines, serving as wave breaks and also as spawning ground for fish, safeguarding the livelihood of fishermen. Forests are also crucial for the hydrological cycle and as water protection areas. In urban centres, forests play a considerable role as air filters and oxygen providers. On a global scale,"
180,151,0.346,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Preterm births, the leading cause of infant mortality, are increasing annually worldwide (World Health Organization 2012). The United States shares company with Nigeria, India, and Brazil among the top ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births and ranks 31st among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations in infant mortality (OECD 2010). Within the United States, racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality remain entrenched and have increased (MacDorman and Mathews 2009). U.S. health policy leaders have made the elimination of health disparities a top public health priority (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2011). Infant mortality is an important area of focus for eliminating disparities, both in its own right and because the rate of infant mortality serves as an indicator of the nationâs health due to its association with maternal health, social and economic conditions, racial discrimination, access to health care, and public health practices (MacDorman and Mathews 2009). During the twentieth century, U.S. infant mortality declined 93 % (MacDorman 2011). In 1900, about 100 infants died per 1000 live births. By 2000, that number fell to 6.89. During the last half of the twentieth century, the rate of black infant mortality dropped dramatically. In 1950, black infant mortality was 43.9 deaths per 1000 live births compared with 26.8 deaths per 1000 live births among whites (Mechanic 2002). But by 1998 black infant mortality fell to 13.8 deaths per 1000 live births compared with 6.0 deaths per 1000 live births among whites. As these numbers show, both groups made significant absolute gains, with blacks gaining more in absolute termsâa reduction of 30.1 for blacks and 20.8 for whites. Yet, black infant mortality still remained about twice that of whites."

The high Cs concentration for the initial 100 days was taken from the coastal monitoring data off Iwasawa, which is 16 km south of the FNPP (Tsumune et al. 2012; TEPCO 2014). As a proxy for moderately contaminated water, we used a value that was 1/10 of the high concentration (see Fig. 3 in Tateda et al. 2013). For the Cs concentrations in food consumed by fish â¥1 year old for six 6-month periods from March 2011 to February 2014, we used values of 80, 40, 10, 5, 2, and 1 Bq/kg-wet, which were based on monitoring data for Japanese sand lance and Japanese anchovy (bait fish) in the coastal waters off northern Fukushima Prefecture (northern half of area IV) (Fisheries Agency 2014) (Fig. 11.5b). For fish younger than 1 year old, we used food concentrations of 40, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 Bq/kg-wet for the same 6-month periods; these values were based on data for mysids in the same area (Sohtome et al. 2014). Fish in the 2009 year-class fed on bait fish throughout the simulation period; the fish in the 2010 year-class fed on mysids from March to August 2011 and then shifted to bait fish; and fish in the 2011 and 2012 year-classes fed on mysids during their first 12 months (Fig. 11.4). The coefficient for Cs intake from seawater (a) was set at 0.1 (approximately equal to the value of 0.11 reported by Tateda et al. 2013). DR and AR were set at 0.02 (Kurita et al., unpublished data) and 0.6 (between the value of 0.5 reported by Tateda et al. 2013 and the value of 0.78 reported by Kasamatsu et al. 2001), respectively. BHL was set at 104 days so that the saturated Cs concentration in the fish body was twice the Cs concentration in the food, which was the observed relationship between the concentrations in fish body and food in the equilibrium state before the accident (Kasamatsu and Ishikawa 1997). In the simulations, we focused on three issues: variation of the Cs concentrations among individuals, the influence of the contamination history during the initial 100 days, and differences in Cs concentrations among the year-classes. First, the effect of Cs concentration in the seawater was evaluated (Fig. 11.5câe). The Cs concentrations in the fish body were simulated for fish in the 2009 yearclass, which fed on bait fish and were exposed to seawater categories A, B, or C. Differences in the Cs intake levels from seawater during the initial 100 days after the accident produced large variations in the maximum Cs concentrations (Fig. 11.5c): 109 Bq/kg-wet (2.04 log transformed; sources of Cs were seawater C + food), 286 Bq/kg-wet (2.46 log transformed; seawater B + food), and 2,504 Bq/ kg-wet (3.40 log transformed; seawater A + food). For fish that were exposed to directly released water (seawater A or B), the body Cs concentration peaked shortly after the accident, at 43 days (23 April 2011) and at 50 days (30 April 2011) for seawaters A and B, respectively, and then decreased rapidly. Even if fish did not take up Cs from seawater during the initial 100 days (seawater C), the body Cs concentration increased to 109 Bq/kg-wet at 184 days (11 September 2011), which corresponds to the peak period of the lowest observed concentrations (as described in Sect. 11.2). High individual variation and a gradual increase in the lowest concentrations until September were observed in the monitored data (Figs. 11.1 and 11.2). Contamination from seawater A was greater than contamination from food during"

We also inspected the bibliographies of relevant publications. Each co-author focused on a specific geographic area (RA, assisted by Olivier Roth: Europe; BM: Australia and tropical Asia; EO: temperate North America; PT: sub-Saharan Africa; KWG: tropical Americas). Our searches were limited to publications with English language text or summaries. We focused on agriculture and animal husbandry for the production of calories for human or animal consumption, excluding forestry systems dedicated to timber or fiber production (see Law et al., Chap. 4), studies in which fallows or abandoned fields were the only agricultural systems investigated, as well as investigations that focused on fragmentation without explicit consideration of the effect of agricultural matrix (see Meyer et al., Chap. 3). We divided results from the literature search into two broad categories of investigations: (1) How agricultural practices affect bat assemblages, ecology, behavior, and/or physiology; and (2) how bats affect agriculture through the provision of ecosystem services such as pollination and pest suppression. Within the first category, most studies addressed effects of land conversion and agricultural management on bat assemblage structure, abundance, activity levels, and behavior. We further subdivided results to consider habitat conversion to agriculture and agricultural intensification. We define agricultural intensification as consisting of at least one of the following: decreased structural complexity of native vegetation (natural and seminatural elements structuring the landscapes such as woodland patches and hedges), increased application of agrochemicals (pesticides, fertilizer), increased crop plant density, increased mechanization, or increased reliance on GM plants. We reviewed results from searches to locate studies which contrasted aspects of bat assemblage structure, abundance, activity, ranging behavior, or diet in either natural and agricultural habitat, or different agricultural systems of contrasting management. To better quantify the responses of bats to habitat conversion and agricultural intensification across multiple disparate studies, we conducted a meta-analysis. We emphasize that this meta-analysis is based on correlational studies, rather than from controlled experiments; because assignment of treatment locations is not randomized in the majority of these studies, confounding factors could result in spurious effect sizes (Egger et al. 1998). We thus view our meta-analysis as a tool for exploring trends across a diverse suite of studies, with limited conclusive power."

Effects were detected for the in vivo species with EC50 values between 0.54 and 5.2 mg/L, whereas EC50 values for cytotoxicity were between ~60 and 87 mg/L. Besseling et al. (2014b) reported that 70 nm polystyrene particles reduced the growth of algae (Scenedesmus obliquus) at high particle concentrations, and malformed offspring of Daphnia at a concentration of 32 mg/L. The effects on Daphnia were studied with and without fish (Perca fluviatilis) kairomones in the water and the effect of the kairomones appeared to be stronger in the presence of 1.8 mg/L nanoplastic. This suggests that nanoplastics might interfere with the chemical communication among species, which would cause subtle behavioural disturbances in finding a mate or food, or in the avoidance of predators such as fish. Such effects may be taking place at low concentrations that are not easy to detect using standard toxicological tests but that may result in changes in the food web in exposed ecosystems over time. In summary, the limited literature provides some evidence of effects of NPs to marine and freshwater organisms, yet at relatively high concentrations, i.e. higher than ~0.5 mg/L NPs. There are currently no NP environmental concentrations to which this value can be compared, but the lowest NP effect concentration of 0.54 mg/L (Casado et al. 2013) is about four to six orders of magnitude higher than the 0.4â34 ng/L microplastic concentrations found in freshwaters in the USA (Eriksen et al. 2013) and Europe (Besseling et al. 2014c), but almost similar to the highest concentration estimated for marine water (i.e. 0.51 mg/L, see Besseling et al. 2014b; Lopez Lozano and Mouat 2009). However, because of the limited data, the uncertainties in these numbers and the absence of actual NP exposure data, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution."
273,47,0.345,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"Water is the source of life, and one of the indispensable physical resources for the survival and development of human society. Globally, the freshwater that can be utilized by humankind only accounts for 0.325 % of the total water volume on Earth. In company with the economic development and population growth, human demand for water resource is also increasing, followed by freshwater resource shortage because of water pollution problems. Discharge of household wastewater and industrial wastewater as well as surface runoff of agricultural pollutants like fertilizer and pesticide, is the leading cause for water pollution. According to the estimates of related international organizations, the population of countries with water resource shortage will increase from 132 million in 1990 to 653 million by 2025 (estimated as per low population growth) or 904 million (estimated as per high population growth); by 2050 the figure will further amount to something between 1.06 billion and 2.43 billion, accounting for about 13â20 % of the estimated world population.6 Lack of safe drinking water and sanitary facilities has resulted in hundred million cases of disease related to water and at least 5,000,000 deaths every year.7 WHOâs investigation also indicates that 80 % of human diseases are related to water pollution. Therefore, rational development and utilization of water resources and strengthening water resource conservation has become a priority."

255,232,0.344,Railway Ecology,"On the other hand, our analysis of the flight initiation distance of different groups of birds showed that they do not seem to respond to trains as if they were predators, but rather human-associated elements (MÃ¸ller et al. 2013; Neumann et al. 2013). Thus, species that are more tolerant of people or even anthropophilic (e.g., passerines and pigeons) show flight initiation distances that are signiï¬cantly shorter than those of crows and birds of prey, which are more predatory (Table 8.5). Some species that are frequently observed around railways (e.g., the crested lark, doves, and pigeons) do not take flight in response to incoming trains, putting themselves at risk of being hit or dragged by the turbulence of the passing train. In short, it is evident that at least some of the birds living in the surroundings of the HSR do not treat trains as a natural threat, and exhibit some habituation to HSR train circulation. However, HSR train speed often proves fatal when birds enter the collision risk area. Both factors could explain the high mortality rates near the HSR relative to rates near other linear infrastructures, though further research on other HSR stretches should be done to determine if this pattern of ï¬ndings is representative of broader HSR areas."

376,666,0.343,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Research on the effects of biodiversity on disease dynamics has been motivated, in part, by the example of Lyme disease (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000). The causative bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi is hosted by white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) that reach higher densities in less diverse ecosystems where mammalian mesopredators and avian raptors are rare or absent. An ensuing debate has concentrated on whether this represents a general relationship between higher biodiversity and lower disease or if this is idiosyncratic and system-specific (Lafferty 2012). Yet for parasites with complex lifestylesâsuch as trematodes, cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans, chytridiomycetes, oomycetes, and myxosporeans that move between multiple host species to complete their life cyclesâthere are multiple different mechanisms by which âdilutionâ or âdecoyâ effects could moderate disease prevalence (Johnson and Thieltges 2010). The debate over the impact of biodiversity on disease is similar to the debate over the mechanisms by which biodiversity may affect ecosystem processes (Loreau et al. 2001; Hooper et al. 2005). Traditionally parasites and pathogens were, and mostly still are, viewed as things to be controlled or eradicated where possible. More recently, however, researchers have been investigating the effects of parasites on ecosystem function and whether a stable and resilient ecosystem has a rich parasite assemblage (Hudson et al. 2006; Vannier-Santos and Lenzi 2011; Hatcher et al. 2012). Similarly, there is an explosion of research on the microbiome, or the microbial community within an individual, and how that community composition affects nutrition and obesity, immune function, disease risk, cancer, and so forth (Kau et al. 2011; Vannier-Santos and Lenzi 2011). Healthy wildlife populations are not necessarily devoid of pathogens (Stephen 2014) but have a mix they coevolved with and which protect them from invasions of novel types."
36,553,0.343,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Abstract Pteropodid bats damage a wide range of fruit crops, exacerbated by continuing loss of their natural food as forests are cleared. In some countries where such damage occurs, bats are not legally protected. In others, as a result of pressure from fruit growers, legal protection is either not implemented or overridden by legislation specifically allowing the killing of bats. Lethal control is generally ineffective and often carried out with shotguns making it an animal welfare issue, as many more animals are injured or orphaned than are killed. Here, we review the literature and current state of the conflict between fruit growers and pteropodids and describe a wide range of potential mitigation techniques. We compile an extensive list of bats and the fruit crops on which they feed where this has resulted in conflicts, or could lead to conflict, with fruit growers. We also discuss the legal status of bats in some countries where such conflicts occur. We found the most effective means of preventing bat damage to crops is the use of fixed nets (that generally prevent entanglement) covering a whole orchard. Netting individual trees, or fruit panicles, using small net bags, is also effective. Management methods that assist netting include pruning to maintain low stature of trees. These S.A.

230,545,0.342,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"13.4.2 Micro- and Nanoplastics and Human Health In terms of human health risks, microplastics as contaminants in the wider environment represent a concern because it has been shown that they can be ingested by a wide range of aquatic organisms, both marine and freshwater, and thus have the potential to accumulate through the food chain. Aquatic organisms for which ingestion of microplastics has been documented in the field include those from across the marine food web, including turtles, seabirds, fish, crustaceans and worms (reviewed by Wright et al. 2013). Laboratory studies have confirmed that many other organisms have the capacity to ingest microplastics including zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013; SetÃ¤lÃ¤ et al. 2012). The majority of studies have documented microplastics in the guts of organisms, an organ that is not generally consumed directly by humans."
167,192,0.342,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"The last section of this chapter deal with three infectious diseases that were all common in the past, and that are considered as minor threats today. Nevertheless, they all bear a potential risk for the future related to changes in the Arctic. Two hundred years ago infectious diseases dominated the high mortality in the Arctic countries. In Sweden smallpox killed more than 300,000 people between 1750 and 1800, in a country with only 2 million inhabitants. After the introduction of vaccine in the early 1800s smallpox mortality decreased rapidly, and in 1976 the World Health Organization declared the disease as totally eradicated from Earth. This was the first infectious disease that human health prevention actively got rid of (SkÃ¶ld 1996). 1918â1920 an influenza pandemic swept over the world, killing between 50 and 100 million people. The Arctic, and especially the Indigenous peoples, were heavily struck. In local communities in Alaska the disease killed up to 90% of the entire population (Mamelund et al. 2013). Anthrax is an infection by bacteria that was already mentioned in the bible as a disease of herbivores, it remained a major cause of death for animals all over the planet until the end of the nineteenth century, with occasional, sometimes extensive, contamination of human beings. Untreated the disease has a fatality rate higher than 90% (Schwartz 2009). What then do these three terrible diseases have in common for the future mortality risks in the Arctic? The answer is the consequences of melting permafrost. Smallpox, influenza and anthrax are relatively resistant to external factors and can survive for long, also in ice. When reports of an anthrax outbreak in Siberia came in 2016, it was stated that the bacteria originated from dead reindeer in 1941 (Nechepurenko 2016; Revitch et al. 2012). Severe epidemics with these diseases would have terrible results, not least since immunity status of the present-day populations is very low, in the case of smallpox non-existing. This is a somewhat neglected consequence of climate change that needs to be highlighted."
10,383,0.342,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"hardly conceivable that there are no impacts. The only regions where nature appears to be rather unthreatened by water scarcity are the two that have water reservoirs. In the Vilaine area, however, this has resulted in the reverse effect, namely that of flooding of wetlands in the dry season. This relates to a second issue, that of the degree of modiï¬cation of the water system. In all regions the water system has been modiï¬ed in the past, either for purposes of flood protection or agricultural efï¬ciency or both. All of these interventions had side effects on other services of the water system that were often not recognized when the interventions took place."

Finding a balance between the needs for bat conservation, sustainable harvesting and public health management is an important approach in the regions where regulated bat hunting is a goal (Halstead 1977). Change in perceptions and attitudes towards conservation and wildlife in general require an effective outreach approach. Thus, education and public awareness projects should be designed to engage the audience as has been demonstrated to be effective in Madagascar (Racey 2013) and Latin America (Navarro 2013). The involvement of all stakeholders and policy makers in conservation outreach projects is crucial to the effectiveness of education programs by facilitating the enactment and enforcement of protective legislation (Robinson et al. 2010)."

169,327,0.341,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"effects on ï¬shes that are likely to inï¬uence macroinvertebrates too: controlling (metabolic and developmental rates), limiting (affecting activity, movement, and distribution), directing (stimulating an orientation response), masking (blocking or affecting the expression to other environmental factors), and lethal effects that act either directly to kill the organism or indirectly as a stress effect. Thus, the responses of the aquatic fauna to water temperature changes might occur at various levels of organization from the molecular through organismal and population to the community level (McCullough et al. 2009; Woodward et al. 2010). Climate and thus climate change can affect almost every component of an individual ï¬shâs life including availability and suitability of habitats, survival, reproduction, and successful hatching, as well as metabolic demands. The temperature thresholds associated with these effects differ not only between species but also between different life stages. Besides the different organizational levels, the responses of aquatic fauna to climate change will be heterogeneous due to regional and taxonomic variations. In the following, the different organizational levels will be discussed and related to climate change impacts with a focus on the population (including species) and community level. At the molecular level, the thermal tolerance of an organism and its physiological limits are key determinants as to whether the organism is able to adapt to the thermal conditions due to its genetic constitution. Biological reactions to impacts on the molecular level include heat shocks, stress responses, and changes to enzyme function or to genetic structure. However, the physiological response of an organism is also linked to other parameters, such as sex, size, season, and water chemistry. Thus, the thermal preference of a species cannot adequately be described by a single temperature value, such as the mean. Several metrics can be used to quantitatively describe the thermal preference and tolerance of a species and its life stages: optimum growth temperature supporting the highest growth rate, ï¬nal temperature preference indicating the temperature toward which a ï¬sh tends to move when exposed to a temperature range, upper incipient lethal limit, the upper temperature value that 50% of ï¬sh survive in an experiment for an extended period, critical thermal maximum that describes the upper temperature in an experiment at which ï¬sh loses its ability to maintain the upright swimming position, optimum spawning temperature, and optimum egg development temperature. Actually, lethal temperatures relate not only to a ï¬xed maximum threshold. The maximum temperature a species or a speciï¬c life stadium withstands is also strongly related to the acclimation time, i.e., the time over which temperature changes. According to Magnuson et al. (1997), aquatic organisms can be classiï¬ed into three thermal guilds: (1) cold-water species with physiological optimums <20  C, (2) coolwater species having their physiological optimums between 20 and 28  C, and (3) warm-water species with an optimum temperature > 28  C. Even though it is possible to delineate thermal niches in the laboratory, evidence from ï¬eld data is much more heterogeneous (Magnuson et al. 1979) as in complex and dynamic river systems the interplay of several biotic and abiotic factors is relevant for the aquatic organisms. At the organismal level, ï¬sh are able to react behaviorally to stay within the range of their thermal tolerance and to avoid stress effects or sublethal effects. Even though ï¬sh, as exotherms, cannot physiologically regulate their body temperature, they are"
376,669,0.341,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","management approaches to control the spread of the disease in elk (Rhyan et al. 2013). Devising such approaches for any wildlife host of a livestock disease will depend upon studies at the landscape scale and population level to understand such issues as: seasonal movements between feeding areas; joining-and-leaving behavior of contagious individuals moving between social groups; use of habitats at key times for disease transmission; effects of climate on the dynamics of populations and the aggregation and dispersal of groups and individuals; and responses to fear induced by hunting and predation. In addition, there are calls for trade policy reforms to relax stringent veterinary regulations such as those responsible for veterinary cordon fences in southern Africa (Fynn and Bonyongo 2011; McGahey 2011; Thomson et al. 2013). There, the fences have decimated migratory wildlife populations that, in the longer term, could be more valuable to local communities than export-quality beef. At a minimum, certain wildlife species should be destigmatized as disease vectors, such as bison in North America and buffalo in South Africa, because disease-free herds can be established and used to restock areas where they can safely comingle with cattle."
102,301,0.34,Saving For Development : How Latin America and The Caribbean Can Save More and Better,"Mortality credits are a source of financing pensions, given the decreasing probability of living as a person ages. Those who survive longer benefit from the resources of those who passed away. This is basically risk pooling and taking advantage of the unknown event of who will survive longer. Figure B7.2 shows an annuity payment in Chile that starts at age 65, and the associated sources of financing over time. Mortality credits became the most significant source after age 85. In this example, the mortality credits from the 1,000 people alive at age 65 would finance the pensions of the 3 of them who survive to age 105 at the same level as they received at age 65, because they are using the resources of the ones who did not survive."
260,131,0.34,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"While LMBV grew slightly faster at 30 Â°C than 25 Â°C, it did not replicate past one day in cell culture when held at 35 Â°C, probably because largemouth bass typically inhabit aquatic systems that do not exceed 30 Â°C (Eaton and Scheller 1996; Grant et al. 2003). Thus, there is strong evidence that ranavirus replication is highly temperature- and host-dependent (Speare and Smith 1992; Grant et al. 2003; Rojas et al. 2005; Ariel et al. 2009b). To the extent that replication in vitro represents replication rates in vivo, we would expect that the rates of viral replication and host mortality would generally increase with temperature. Results from several studies are consistent with this hypothesis. In experimental water bath challenges of adult redfin perch, all of the fish held at water temperatures of 12â21 Â°C died, while those at 6â10 Â°C either did not become infected or quickly cleared the infection (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995). Experimental challenges of European stocks of redfin perch and rainbow trout with EHNV also found that mortality increased with temperature (from 15 to 20 Â°C), and significant mortality was not observed at 10 Â°C (Ariel and Jensen 2009). Similarly, Bayley et al. (2013) reported >96 % mortality of the common frog tadpoles exposed to ranaviruses (FV3 [Frog virus 3] or REV [Rana esculenta virus]) at 20 Â°C but <32 % when exposed to ranaviruses at 15 Â°C. A contrasting pattern was observed in a study conducted with larval tiger salamanders and ATV (Rojas et al. 2005). Larvae exposed to ATV and reared at 10 or 18 Â°C experienced >80 % mortality, while larvae reared at 26 Â°C experienced <38 % mortality. Viral titers were higher in salamanders that died at 10 Â°C than 18 Â°C, suggesting that colder temperature may have suppressed immune responses to ATV. There is also evidence in turtles that temperature influences the outcome of infection. Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) infected with FV3 experienced 100 % mortality at 22 Â°C but 50 % mortality at 28 Â°C (Allender et al. 2013b). Additionally, time to death was shorter and viral loads greater in turtles at 22 Â°C compared to those at 28 Â°C. Allender et al. (2013b) hypothesized that cell-mediated or humoral immune responses could be enabling turtles to clear infections at higher temperatures. Instead of focusing on the kinetics of viral replication and host immune responses, temperature could be a stressor in and of itself. Bayley et al. (2013) found greater mortality in R. temporaria tadpoles held at 20 Â°C than at 15 Â°C when exposed to FV3, PPIV (Pike perch iridovirus), and REV, but mortality was also greater at 20 Â°C in the unexposed control animals, suggesting that the higher temperature was generally stressful. Several fish challenges have shown increased mortality at temperatures near the fishesâ thermal limits (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995; Grant et al. 2003). Ariel and Jensen (2009) noted that mortality in rainbow trout exposed to EHNV was highest at 20 Â°C, which is beyond the natural temperature range for this species and likely stressful or immunosuppressive. The redfin perch in their study, however, experienced the greatest mortality at intermediate temperaturesâtwice as much at 15 Â°C than 20 Â°C, and very little at 10 Â°Câso temperature-induced stress appears not to be important in this species. Perhaps viral replication was favored at 15 Â°C more than the hostâs immune system, whereas the immune system was dominant at 20 Â°C (Ariel and Jensen 2009). Similarly, Echaubard et al. (2014) found that the rate of mortality in experimental epidemics with northern leopard frog and wood"
233,528,0.34,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"survey coverage, whether coastal or oceanic, is very limited (Jewell et al. 2012). Less than 25 % of the ocean surface has been surveyed and only 6 % has been covered frequently enough to allow estimations of population trends (Kaschner et al. 2012). In addition, spatial coverage is also signiï¬cantly biased towards some ocean basins. Karchner et al. (2012) reported that with the exception of Antarctic waters, survey coverage was biased toward the northern hemisphere, especially US and northern European waters, which may explain the consensus among methods identifying the Aleutian and Hawaiian Islands as CPAs. Nevertheless, despite this potential data bias most CPAs were found in the southern hemisphere, suggesting that phylogenetic conservation priority methods do not simply reï¬ect sampling effort, but identify areas that contain aquatic mammal communities including both evolutionarily unique species and those at risk. As we discussed in our methods, CPAs were the result from the cumulative values for each metric in each cell. Thus CPAs may reï¬ect a large number of species varying in conservation priority values or possibly only a few species with high values. The later seems to be the case for Hawaii, Nouadhibou, Madeira Island, Yangtze river, and Southern Brazil-Argentina where highly evolutionary unique species are endemic to those areas (Table 2). Other CPAs such as California, Southern Australia and New Zealand include many species, but only some of which are evolutionarily unique species. These areas are part of ranges of several species with very broad distribution ranges such as the sperm whale, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales, and blue whale. Interestingly, previous studies that have used species richness to identify âhotspotâ of aquatic mammal diversity (Pompa et al. 2011) and a combination of levels of imperilment with intrinsic and extrinsic factors to identify high risk areas for aquatic mammals (Davidson et al. 2011) agree with the CPAs identiï¬ed here. Davidson et al. (2011) identiï¬ed ï¬ve major global hotspots of marine mammal species at risk. Within these major hotpots several locations overlap with those found in this study: Aleutian Islands, Alaska, California, Galapagos, Patagonia, South Africa, Japan, Indonesia, South Australia, and New Zealand. Pompa et al. (2011) identiï¬ed nine âhotspotsâ based solely on species richness and 11 irreplaceable key conservation sites, based on the presence of endemic species, ï¬ve of these sites Hawaiian and Galapagos Islands, Mediterranean Sea, and the Yangtze river network were also identiï¬ed as CPAs. Finally, Kashner et al. (2011) using an environmental suitability model predicted highest marine mammal richness in New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, Galapagos, the Southeast Paciï¬c and Southern Ocean, all congruent with our study. Within the CPAs identiï¬ed here we highlight the presence of several top ranking conservation priority species among those are the extant monk seals (see Table 2). The UICN has estimated a 68 % reduction of Hawaiian monk seal abundance in the past 49 years, and projects an 86 % reduction in the next 15 years. The future for the Mediterranean monk seal seems bleak, current population estimates are about 350â 450 individuals (IUCN 2013). The Cap Blanc population in Nouadhibou is probably the most threatened, with less than 220 individuals. This is the last population with colonial structure, so its loss would also lead to the loss of a peculiar behavior amongst monk seals (e.g., Gonzalez 2006; Martinez-Jauregui et al. 2012; Gonzalez"

In recent years however, despite several cold winters, cod have suffered very poor recruitment in the North Sea, although it is unclear whether this is a direct consequence of changed climatic conditions, reduced availability of planktonic prey items for larval ï¬sh or over-ï¬shing of the parental stock (i.e. some sort of âAllee effectâ) (Mieszkowska et al. 2009), or more intensive predation of cod larvae by pelagic ï¬sh stocks which have increased, such as herring and sprat (Engelhard et al. 2014a). A clear seasonal shift to earlier appearance ofï¬sh larvae has been described for several species at Helgoland Roads in the southern North Sea (Greve et al. 2005), and this has been linked to marked changes in zooplankton composition and sea surface temperature in this region (Beaugrand et al. 2002). In particular, there has been a decline in the abundance of the copepod Calanus ï¬nmarchicus but an increase in the closely related but smaller species C. helgolandicus. Calanus ï¬nmarchicus is a key prey item for cod larvae in the northern North Sea, and the loss of this species has been correlated with recent failures in cod recruitment and an apparent increase in flatï¬sh recruitment (Reid et al. 2001, 2003; Beaugrand et al. 2003). Calanus helgolandicus occur at the wrong time of the year to be of use to emerging cod larvae. Greve et al.

In general, commercial landings of most primary species appear to be stable and cases of instability, where observed, tend to be tied to regulations created to manage fish stocks. However, the largest component of the commercial fishing sectorâthe shrimp fisheryâis confronted with obstacles to long-run viability, with the primary obstacle being increasing imports. Increasing imports have led to a decline in dockside price and a concomitant downsizing of the industry. In the recreational sector, the number of Gulf angler trips (excluding Texas) increased from an estimated 17 million annually during the decade of the 1990s to 23 million annually during the most recent decade. About 70 % of total Gulf recreational trips were based in Florida (west coast); Louisiana accounted for 17 % of total recreational fishing activity. An estimated 92 thousand jobs (including Texas) were generated as a result of Gulf recreational fishing in 2009, with generated income totaling about $5.1 billion."
246,305,0.339,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Danube Delta: Europeâs Unrivalled Wetland The Danube Delta on the border between Romania and Ukraine is outstanding in Europeâdue to its size (over 600,000 ha), intact river dynamics, unexploited coastline (shaped by the Danube River and the Black Sea together), wide horizons and large-scale landscapes without significant infrastructure (Fig. 9.7). It also has the largest reed beds in the world, in addition to millions of nesting and migrating birds, many of them rare and some even globally endangered. However, some of the key wildlife species are still missing, such as wolf, red deer and beaver. Due to poisoning, numbers of species like black kites ( Milvus migrans), golden jackals ( Canis aureus) or vultures are extremely low. Apart from legal enforcement, giving value to these species as part of the wildlife watching economy should stimulate social control to avoid these illegal practices."
246,173,0.339,Rewilding European Landscapes,"sanitary regulations impose the efficient elimination of livestock remains, and modern societies require that industrial activities are performed in a way that minimizes their ecological footprint, these services have acquired a new dimension: vultures can remove carcasses at zero cost whereas the elimination of livestock carcasses by means of industrial procedures entails high expenditures (transport: 20 â¬/animal; destruction: 96 â¬/t; see DonÃ¡zar et al. 2009a, b). Moreover, the CO2 emissions derived from the transport and burning of carcasses are not negligible. Consequently, modern farming economies may still find vultures to be useful allies in sustaining traditional uses of Mediterranean landscapes (Deygout et al. 2009). In modern societies, vultures, like other large birds, are highly attractive wildlife, providing several recreational services: the delight experienced from the beauty of a vulture in flight or soaring in large groups, or the observation of feeding behaviour and interactions, among other, bring great value to the environment (Fig. 5.6). These services may be translated into significant incomes derived from âecotourismâ (see Chap. 3). For instance, it is estimated that visitors for griffon vulture watching in Israel provides around US$ 1.1â1.2 million per year (Becker et al. 2005) and the park âLa falaise aux vautoursâ in the French Pyrenees receives 15,000â20,000 visitors per year whose primary motivation is wildlife viewing activities. Overall, the observation of scavenger breeding areas and vulture restaurants is an increasingly common activity within specialized touristic tours. This can improve the income of those southern European rural societies subject to profound environmental and socioeconomic changes. To summarize, we can conclude that scavenging directly contributes to human well-being. Avian scavengers provide regulation/maintenance and cultural services due to their valuable role in the decomposition of carcasses, pest control, biodiversity maintenance, and tourism attraction (Haines-Young and Potschin 2013; Maes et al. 2013)"

Species that are unable to adapt their phenology or track climate through space will be most vulnerable to extinction. In data from Thoreauâs woods in Concord, MA, spanning 100 years, it is already possible to detect declines in populations among species that have failed to shift their phenologies to match recent climate change (Willis et al. 2008, 2010). These data also revealed phylogenetic structure in species responses, suggesting evolutionary conservatism not only in ï¬owering times, but also plasticity in ï¬owering times (see also Davies et al. 2013). As for animals, there has been much work aimed at identifying intrinsic lifehistory traits that predispose some plant species towards extinction (Sodhi et al. 2008). However, investigating the correlates of extinction risk within the plant kingdom has proven somewhat more challenging, as key traits frequently differ between studies (Walker and Preston 2006; Sodhi et al. 2008). In addition, traits explain only a small proportion of the variation in extinction risk and, with the exception of geographic range size, we have yet to reveal any single strong correlate equivalent to, for example, body size in mammals. Life-history traits that have been found to correlate with plant extinction include pollination syndrome (e.g. wind or animal mediated), sexual system, habit, height, and dispersal mode (Sodhi et al. 2008). For tropical angiosperms, these traits can explain ~10 % of extinction risk (Sodhi et al. 2008), whereas equivalent models of intrinsic drivers for mammals can explain up to 30 % of the variation in extinction risk (Cardillo et al. 2008). However, even for mammals, explanatory power tends to be lower when exploring predictors across disparate clades (Cardillo et al. 2008), reï¬ecting clade speciï¬c sensitivities to different drivers. Perhaps, therefore, it is unsurprising that in ï¬owering plants, a group containing up to 500,000 species, predictive models are often poor. An alternative avenue of exploration has considered the importance of evolutionary history in models of extinction risk (Sodhi et al. 2008; Davies et al. 2011). In plants, there is increasing evidence that a species evolutionary history might be more important than its life history in explaining extinction risk. As mentioned above, threatened terrestrial plants generally fall within species-rich clades (Schwartz and Simberloff 2001; Pilgrim et al. 2004) that represent recent radiations (Davies et al. 2011). However, when we look at the distribution of extinction risks across plant families, species-poor and especially monotypic families also appear to contain species at higher risk of extinction (Vamosi and Wilson 2008). It is therefore possible that mechanistic explanations for variation in extinction risk differ between old and young clades. Old and species-poor families may represent remnants of once more diverse clades, with species vulnerabilities associated with intrinsic life history traits and long generation times, as in mammals. In contrast, extinction risk in younger, still diversifying clades, may be more closely linked to the speciation process, with high extinction risk more closely associated with traits driving speciation, such as small geographic range size and short generation times."
113,345,0.339,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"As the sermon continued, I found myself remembering what I had learned of traditional Fore and Gimi cosmology from reading ethnographies of the region: how human life force (auma or auna) had to be recycled into the forest to regenerate plants, animals, and people through song, weeping, and proper disposal of the corpse (Gillison 1993; West 2005; Whitfield 2008). The anthropologists who had documented these beliefs emphasized that the period immediately after a death was a dangerous time, when the personâs homeless, wandering souls could lash out in anger and harm the living. If a person was not properly mourned, its life force would âcling to the body or hamlet foreverâ (West 2005: 636), causing sickness and death in the living. The Bible verses attested to a different view of death: the body was now an âevil thing of the earth,â its loss a cause for rejoicing, not weeping. But if anything of traditional cosmology had survived Christian conversion, it was the danger associated with the liminal time before burial, and the atmosphere of blame and anger surrounding death. Teachersâ fears about exposing students to village conflicts meant that they would only work with particular types of rural peopleâthose who were pastors, who lived in nuclear family households, and who lived inside the mission compound. It seemed ironic to me: the people who benefited from the labor and teachings of the nursing students were those who already lived in relatively safe circumstances and who had the advantages that came with being inside the mission fence. The hamlet was âtoo dangerous,â its people too overwhelmed by anger and grief, too bound to pasin; the families inside the mission fence would be better equipped to daunim bel (suppress their anger) and cooperate with us. While the leaderâs death created a particularly tense atmosphere, the idea that the hauslain was an intrinsically risky place because âthe pasin is strongâ was not unique to this occasion. I had accompanied the first year class a few weeks previously on their rural experience in a different district, and students had been vigilant about not transgressing local customs. Female students had kept a particularly close eye on their clothing, food scraps, and sugarcane skins, emphasizing that all of these could be"

36,456,0.337,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"11.7 Mitigating Bat Mortality As reported previously, most bat fatalities occur during relatively low-wind conditions over a relatively short period of time in late summer (Arnett et al. 2008) and operational adjustments under these conditions and during this time could reduce impacts on bats (Arnett 2005; Arnett et al. 2008; Kunz et al. 2007a). Behr and von Helversen (2006) were the first to examine operational mitigation in Germany, documenting around 50 % fewer bats killed at turbines having their cut-in speed (wind speed at which turbines begin producing electricity into the power grid) raised above the set manufactureâs cut-in speed of 4.0 m/s. In the synthesis of operational mitigation studies in the USA and Canada, Arnett et al. (2013a) reported that most studies documented at least a 50 % reduction in bat fatalities when turbine cutin speed was increased by 1.5 m/s above the manufacturerâs cut-in speed, with up to a 93 % reduction in bat fatalities in one study (Arnett et al. 2011). Baerwald et al. (2009) demonstrated beneficial reductions (~60 %) with a low-speed idling approach. Young et al. (2011) discovered that feathering turbine blades (pitched 90Â° and parallel to the wind) at or below the manufacturerâs cut-in speed resulted in up to 72 % fewer bats killed when turbines produced no electricity into the power grid. Arnett et al. (2013a) noted that studies failing to demonstrate statistically significant effects could be explained by lack of treatments being implemented during the study (i.e., winds were either too low or high to enable comparison of treatments). In Portugal, a mitigation study found that estimated mortality at turbine with raised cut-in speed was 0.3 bats/turbine compared to 1.6 bats/turbine at turbines operating normally, which resulted in a 78.5 % reduction in bat fatalities assuming all turbines at the facilities had raised cut-in speed (LEA 2010). More recently, situation-dependent operation protocols, so-called algorithms, were developed for the operation of wind turbines. These algorithms consider a"

We consider three categories of risksâpredisposing, inciting, and contributing. Predisposing factors are current and antecedent stresses that increase an ecosystemâs susceptibility to short-duration stresses, such as drought (inciting factor), or to longer term change in climate (contributing factor). Predisposing factors include stresses related to current states or values of variables that are internal to ecosystems and dynamic over ecological timescales (current regional climate, soil resources, biota, and disturbance regime; lower panel). In the upper panel, we illustrate a case in which climate change (contributing factor) exacerbates negative effects of a recent stress, such as drought (inciting factor), for a rangeland on which processes already are limited by a warm/dry climate, overgrazing, or a sparse, species-poor plant canopy (predisposing factors) to increase process variability sufficiently to change average process levels"

260,72,0.337,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ranavirus infections in amphibians, fish, and reptiles are widespread and affect a diverse suite of species within these vertebrate classes (Table 1, Fig. 6). The species affected include some that are economically important (e.g., rainbow trout, softshelled turtle, bullfrogs), but also several that are of conservation concern (e.g., Chinese giant salamander, gopher tortoise, dusky gopher frog, pallid sturgeon). The economic and conservation risk of these multispecies pathogens is dependent upon many factors, including characteristics of the host species. One thing is certain â some host species are highly susceptible to ranavirus, and these species are most likely to be affected during outbreaks. Thus, understanding host susceptibility to different ranaviruses is key to quantifying risk. Hostâpathogen interactions between ranaviruses and amphibians are the best characterized. Research in this area needs to continue, but there also needs to be greater attention on the role of reptiles and fish in ranavirus epizootic events."
291,50,0.337,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"4.1 From Death Counts to Death Rates The basic units of any mortality analysis are death counts. In most scientific disciplines those counts are expressed as rates by dividing them by a unit of time. Examples are heart rates counting beats per minute or becquerel measuring the radioactive decay of nuclei per second. Things are more complicated when death counts are analyzed: For instance, 30,140 people died at age 80 in Germany in 2000. The corresponding number of Austria is 2,765 (HMD, 2017). Inferring that the risk of dying is more than ten-fold higher in Germany than in Austria is obviously wrong. Death rates areâas all demographic ratesâtherefore standardized dividing the counts by the corresponding number of life-years lived (see, for example Chap. 1.4 in Preston et al. 2001). The latter are often called âexposuresâ and are typically approximated by an estimate of the mid-year population. In the example above, the death rates at age x D 80 in year t D 2000, usually denoted as m.x; t/ would correspond to: Austria W"
222,87,0.336,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This research dynamically analyses the two most important ecosystem services in terms of livelihoods in the delta: agriculture (including aquaculture where appropriate Chap. 24) and fisheries (focusing on offshore capture fisheries Chap. 25) under future environmental change and management scenarios. The area and species distribution of the Sundarbans mangrove forest are also modelled with a preliminary assessment of ecosystem services including protection against storm surges (Chap. 26). These three key provisioning services were operationalised using seven social-ecological systems, defined as freshwater and brackish aquaculture, irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, riverine and char environments, the coastal zone and the Sundarbans dependent zone (see Chap. 22, Adams et al. 2013, 2016). The social-ecological system classification recognises that although in certain regions a specific type of service may dominate livelihoods, households usually have more than one type of income source and that these sources may change through the year depending on the character of the ecosystem (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 2010). Households select different ecosystem services from within the bundle at different times of the year. Social-ecological systems are thus the result of human activities to mediate the negative impacts of environmental variability and to manage bundles of ecosystem services (MartÃ­n-LÃ³pez et al. 2012). Social systems dictate the rules of access to resources and influence the winners and losers of trade-offs between different benefits (Walker et al. 2004), ultimately affecting the relationship between ecosystem service dependence and poverty outcomes. The relationship between ecosystem services and poverty changes because social mechanisms and other factors co-vary with bundles of ecosystem services. For example, the presence of opportunities for supplementing incomes with open access resources (e.g. fisheries, forest products), land ownership, opportunities for sharecropping and leasing land, agricultural labour, access to off-farm income opportunities, the level of exposure to extreme events, the impacts of cyclones and storm"

Subsequent research has highlighted the potential threat posed by drifting litter transporting organisms outside their native ranges (Barnes 2002; Barnes and Milner 2005; Gregory 2009). This is a serious problem, especially in remote regions, and can result in the transfer of potentially harmful organisms (MasÃ³ et al. 2003). However, it probably pales into insignificance in most regions compared to the transport by shipping and other human-mediated vectors (Bax et al. 2003), which in extreme cases can transfer entire communities across ocean basins (Wanless et al. 2010)."
4,56,0.336,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"After birth, the most obvious measure of child welfare is also a tragic one: whether a child dies early on. The âinfant mortality rateâ is defined as the number of children who die before their first birthday, per 1,000 live births. Figure 2.1 summarizes changes in infant mortality between 1960 and 2010 for six countries that are broadly representative of what has occurred in the region: Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica, and Panama. Each panel corresponds to a different country. Each bar in a panel represents the infant mortality rate of that country in a given year. As with many social outcomes, it is useful to benchmark a countryâs performance relative to other countries with similar income levels. For example, was infant mortality in Brazil in 2010 higher, lower, or roughly the same as that of other countries with comparable income levels? To get a sense of this, next to each bar, a circle that represents the average infant mortality rate of all countries with a similar per capita GDP in that year is included (see Box 2.3 for methodological details).3"

Hence, reductions in bat populations as a result of hunting could have expensive ramifications on local communitiesâ water supplies, agriculture, and eco-tourism industries. Finally, the hunting of bats may also expose human communities to potentially zoonotic pathogens (Leroy et al. 2005). In the past decade, considerable attention has been paid to bats as natural reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases (Calisher et al. 2006). Studies that link infectious disease outbreaks to bats demonstrate the spillover potential through contact with bats or exposure to faeces and urine in bat habitats (reviewed by Plowright et al. 2015). Most notable are the Ebola virus outbreaks, which have attracted international attention. Leroy et al. (2009) suggest that the 2007 emergence of Ebola virus in the Occidental Kasai province of DRC could be attributable to the consumption of freshly killed bats. The authors trace the virus spread from a first patient with bat bushmeat contact to an outbreak of the disease in 260 persons resulting in 186 deaths in 2007. The re-emergence of the disease in 2014 may also have arisen from contact with bats (SaÃ©z et al. 2015) and has proven far more deadly."

The importance of taxonomy in protecting species is most immediately visible under the Convention for International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) agreement. With 179 Parties having now joined the Convention, to which they agree to voluntarily adhere, CITES provides a rank system with varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 plant and animal species. Under CITES, all Acerodon and Pteropus species, or flying foxes, are listed as Appendix I or II. Appendix I species are deemed as threatened by extinction and all international trade is prohibited except for non-commercial purposes (e.g., scientific research). Appendix II affords protection to species that are not currently threatened, but may become threatened without controlled trade. Appendix II also protects similar-looking species in order to discourage illegal wildlife trafficking. All members of Acerodon and Pteropus are listed at both the genus and species level because many species have very restricted ranges and some are endangered, but species identificationâespecially by non-expertsâis extremely difficult. The only nonpteropodid currently listed by CITES is the Uruguay population of the whitelined broad-nosed bat (Platyrrhinus lineatus), which is listed under Appendix III. Appendix III species are protected within a signatory country, but that signatory country has indicated it requires extended cooperation from other countries to prevent exploitation. The importance of taxonomy in international agreements is also evident in the Convention on Migratory Speciesâ (CMS) EUROBATS Agreement, which originally recognized 37 species, but now includes all 52 bat species (both migratory and non-migratory) in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. EUROBATS sets legal protection standards and develops and promotes management and conservation strategies across international borders, with 35 of 63 states within the targeted range as signatories. Revisions to the number of species listed, with an increase of 7 new species since 1995, are due to continuing taxonomic work in the region (CMS 2013)."

For this purpose, we would like to use a description-oriented method. Through descriptions of damaged sites, we will know the complexity of damages brought by the earthquake, tsunami, and the NPP accident. For the horrible triple disasters, there were over 20,000 deaths and missing persons. Approximately 170,000 people evacuated from their homes in Japan. Three prefectures in particularâMiyagi, Iwate, and Fukushimaâwere the most affected (for example, deaths in the Miyagi prefecture reached over 10,000). We summarize the number of victims, focusing on these three prefectures, in Table 1.1 The tsunami wiped out several hundred kilometers of coastline in towns. Concerning causes of death, drowning was responsible for over 90% of lost victims, and about 65% of the victims were over the age of 60 [3]. Looking at the press release by the national government on June 24, 2011, it was estimated that total losses for the building, life-line, social infrastructure, agriculture, and others reached approximately 16.9 trillion yen. Over 25 million tons of rubble and general waste were generated. Of course, there continues to be other serious problems, such as the stress of disaster victims, discrimination, etc. In addition, the social conditions were different between damaged areas. Previous studies showed that local towns that were seriously injured were considered to be an aging society, farming and ï¬sheries society, and generally poorer than when compared to metropolitan society [1, 2]. And of course, such negative conditions compound upon each other. Generally speaking, the municipalities that were seriously injured faced deeply-indented coastlines; this geographical disadvantage is not only vulnerable to tsunamis but also reinforced aging and economically vulnerable society. Furthermore, these vulnerabilities (such as an aging"

169,270,0.335,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Rivers belong to the most diverse ecosystems on earth (Bosshard 2015) but are highly threatened by habitat fragmentation (Dynesius and Nilsson 1994; Nilsson et al. 2005). On a global scale, there are currently more than 58,400 large dams (i.e. >15 m in height) which mainly serve the purpose of irrigation, hydropower production, water supply and ï¬ood control (ICOLD 2016). These dams fragment more than 60% of all large rivers (i.e. >1000 km in length) with even higher fragmentation rates in Europe where only 28% of large rivers remain free ï¬owing (WWF 2006). Due to limited migration opportunities in stream networks, disconnections are particularly damaging, making it more difï¬cult or even impossible for ï¬sh to avoid barriers (Fagan 2002; Fullerton et al. 2010). Therefore, the dramatic loss in global aquatic biodiversity is not surprising (Pringle et al. 2000; Rosenberg et al. 2000). With 37% of Europeâs freshwater ï¬shes threatened and another 4% near-threatened with extinction, they show one of the highest threat levels of any major taxonomic group (Freyhof and Brooks 2011). As it is assumed that 10,000â20,000 freshwater species are already extinct or at risk of extinction (VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty et al. 2010), the current rates are more than 1000 times the normal background rate (Master 1990). This may explain the steep decline in abundance since the mid-1980s (Latham et al. 2008) for migratory ï¬sh species, which are particularly susceptible to fragmentation (Lucas and Baras 2001; Pringle 2006; Ovidio and Philippart 2008). Examples include endangered medium-distance migrants (e.g. Acipenser ruthenus, Hucho hucho) and large-distance migratory species (e.g. Acipenser stellatus, Huso huso) which became extinct in the upper Danube catchment as a consequence of the closure of the Iron Gate dams (Spindler et al. 1997; Jungwirth et al. 2003)."

260,142,0.334,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Given this interspecific variation in susceptibility (and, presumably, differences in shedding rates and behavior), community composition is likely to influence the likelihood, dynamics, and outcome of ranavirus outbreaks. Species that amplify pathogen transmission increase the likelihood of an outbreak occurring (Paull et al. 2012). Moreover, the order in which host species are exposed to the pathogen may change outcomes. Brenes (2013) demonstrated in aquatic mesocosms that, if wood frog tadpoles were exposed to ranavirus first, community-level mortality was greater than if upland chorus frog (P. feriarum) or spotted salamander (A. maculatum) larvae were exposed first. Additionally, if the community was composed of three highly susceptible species, community-level morality was greater than if it was composed of only one highly susceptible species (Brenes 2013). The second general pattern of susceptibility is that, despite their generally broad host ranges, ranaviruses appear to be better at infecting animals in the taxonomic class from which they were isolated. In particular, it appears that fish and at least some reptiles are less susceptible to ATV and FV3-like ranaviruses than amphibians (Jancovich et al. 2001; Picco et al. 2010; Allender et al. 2013b; Brenes et al. 2014a). Several studies have demonstrated little or no transmission of ATV (Jancovich et al. 2001; Picco et al. 2010) and FV3 to fish (Ariel et al. 2010; Gobbo et al. 2010; Bang Jensen et al. 2011a; but see Bang Jensen et al. 2011b). Similarly, amphibians may be less susceptible to fish ranaviruses. Bayley et al. (2013) found that the European common frog could be infected with FV3 and REV as tadpoles and adults (and with PPIV as tadpoles), but not with several other fish viruses (doctorfish virus, European sheetfish virus, guppy virus 6, EHNV, and SERV). Distinctions in host range may be found even within species of ranavirus. For example, the turtles in Brenes et al. (2014b) developed subclinical infections with FV3-like viruses isolated from a fish and turtle, but none were infected by the frog isolate. We caution against extrapolating these patterns too broadly, however. Researchers have only begun to sketch the host ranges of ranaviruses, so it remains an open question whether the patterns described above are general, and if so, why."

126,305,0.334,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"The pastoral economy in transboundary Turkana lands has drastically declined in recent decades, largely due to the effects of colonial and post-colonial policies. Faced with radical herd losses, thousands of Turkana households have moved to Lake Turkanaâs western shoreline for ï¬shing and/or herding. This populationâlargely uncountedâis extremely vulnerable to loss of accessible Lake Turkana water, ï¬sheries resources, and lakeside grazing. The Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural plantations along the Omo would cause major shoreline retreat and eliminate the Omo Riverâs annual flood âpulseâ of fresh-water and nutrients into the lake. Major loss of ï¬sh reproductive habitat and ï¬sh stocks as well as potable water, along with desiccation of lakeside environments essential to livestock and people would result. As conditions worsen, a general movement of ï¬shing and ï¬shing/pastoral villages southward toward Fergusonâs Gulfâitself drying outâand around towns, in search of relief aid or survival opportunities, is likely. With no practical means of continued livelihood, hundreds of thousands of Turkana ï¬shers and pastoralists would face region wide hunger and conditions for disease epidemics. Cross-border conflict between these Turkana and their northern neighbors would sharply escalate, especially in the face of regional arms trafï¬cking. Northern and central Turkana protests and pleas for help have so far been ignored by the Kenyan government which continues to militarize the region."
179,1041,0.334,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 1: Water Quality, Sediments, Sediment Contaminants, Oil and Gas Seeps, Coastal Habitats, Offshore Plankton and Benthos, and Shellfish","Coastal habitats, such as beaches, salt marshes, and mangroves, can experience severe alteration from hurricanes and other tropical storms. Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall in Florida and Louisiana in late August 1992, removed sections of salt marsh and deposited them in shallow ponds and bays (Cahoon 2006). Hurricane Katrina similarly impacted brackish marshes east of the Mississippi River resulting in more than 80 ha (200 acres) of land loss (Morton and Barras 2011). Sediment and wrack deposition during hurricanes can bury marsh vegetation and result in plant mortality (Guntenspergen et al. 1995; Valiela and Rietsma 1995). Also, saltwater intrusion in lower salinity coastal marshes disrupts system ecology, resulting in short-term vegetation dieback (Cahoon 2006). In contrast to the negative effects of hurricanes and storms, hurricane-generated sediment input can counterbalance relative sea-level rise and promote wetland sustainability (McKee and Cherry 2009). In addition, bare patches resulting from wrack deposition allow for the recruitment of other plant species, generating habitat heterogeneity and increasing plant diversity (Guntenspergen et al. 1995). Mangrove forests in Florida have been periodically disturbed by hurricanes, such as Hurricane Donna in 1960 (Craighead and Gilbert 1962), Hurricane Andrew in 1992 (Smith et al. 1994; Baldwin et al. 1995), and Hurricane Wilma in 2006 (Whelan et al. 2009). These and other studies have documented the impacts of such storms on subsequent structure and function of mangrove forests, including defoliation and losses of branches or entire trees (Davis 1995; Baldwin et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2004; Milbrandt et al. 2006; Profitt et al. 2006; Ward et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009; Whelan et al. 2009; Castaneda-Moya et al. 2010; Harris et al. 2010). Recovery of mangroves after hurricane disturbance is a function of a complex interaction of factors, including seedling recruitment and survival, resprouting capability, and colonization by herbaceous vegetation (Baldwin et al. 2001). Post-disturbance site productivity (Ross et al. 2006) and spatial variation in hurricane impact (Thaxton et al. 2007) further influence regeneration success. Recovery of ecological structure generally occurs, but it is a relatively slow process compared to herbaceous systems. Hurricane damage to seagrass beds can be highly variable and depends on location as well as hurricane characteristics (Smith et al. 1994; Courtemanche et al. 1999; Paerl et al. 2001; Coles and Brown 2007; CebriaÌn et al. 2008; Anton et al. 2009). Hurricanes have been observed to cause widespread damage to seagrasses, but also to pass with little or no damage (Poiner et al. 1989; Hemminga and Duarte 2000). For example, a cyclone and its associated rainfall caused a loss of approximately 1,000 km2 (247,000 ac) of seagrass in Hervey Bay, Australia (Preen et al. 1995). Other reports have shown hurricanes having only small impacts on seagrass beds and associated macrophytes (Fourqurean and Rutten 2004; Tilmant et al. 1994). Hurricane Katrina was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history, with winds over 264 km/h (164 mi/h) and a storm surge of 7.8 to 8.5 m (25.6 to 27.9 ft) in the western coast of Mississippi (Hsu et al. 2005). Anton et al. (2009) showed that this powerful hurricane had no major impact on seagrass density, biomass, or community structure (abundance of producers and consumers) in a seagrass bed located approximately 100 km (62 mi) to the east of the hurricaneâs landfall. Overall, this research showed that natural temporal changes in seagrass metabolism, recorded before the hurricane, were larger than any post-storm changes. Conversely, a combination of tropical storm activity and higher-than-average watershed discharge in the Big Bend area of Florida is believed to have caused severe reductions in seagrass distribution and abundance up to 2005; absence of storm activity and relatively low river"
36,328,0.334,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Several species of bats have been found to roost close to bodies of water to minimize the energy expenditure required to reach important drinking or foraging sites (Racey 1998; Korine et al. 2013). The need to drink directly after emerging from the roosts may be the main factor determining the proximity of roosts to water, especially for maternity colonies (Racey 1998). M. daubentonii, whose foraging strictly depends on water habitat, often uses bridges over rivers, as well as buildings or cavity-bearing trees in the immediate surroundings of riparian biotopes (Racey 1998; Parsons and Jones 2003; LuÄan and Radil 2010; EncarnaÃ§Ã£o 2012). Several other species, such as Nattererâs bat (Myotis nattereri), pipistrelles (Pipistrellus spp.) and brown long-eared bat, also tend to roost in landscapes comprising bodies of water that provide drinking and foraging opportunities (Racey 1998; Entwistle et al. 1997; Oakeley and Jones 1998). Floodplain forests of central Europe host important reproductive colonies of tree-roosting noctule bat Nyctalus noctula (GÃ¶rfÃ¶l et al. 2009). Myotis macropus, an Australian species, has a variable roosting behaviour but the primary force behind roost selection is proximity to waterways (Campbell 2009)."
230,212,0.334,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011; Tanaka et al. 2013; Lavers et al. 2014) and/or using experimental techniques to measure the bioaccumulation of chemicals from plastic in laboratory animals (Gaylor et al. 2012; Besseling et al. 2013; Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013b; Chua et al. 2014). Modeling approaches are useful for interpreting experimental and observation data, as well as for risk assessment of the hazards caused by plastic ingestion in wildlife (Koelmans 2015). Because this is discussed in detail by Koelmans (2015), the discussion here will be limited to observational data in the field and experimental data in the laboratory. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that chemical contaminants do transfer from plastic debris to marine animals. Correlative evidence in the field and laboratory shows that the concentrations of PCBs (Ryan et al. 1988; Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011) and trace metals (Lavers et al. 2014) in seabirds are positively correlated with the mass of ingested plastic. Moreover, seabirds collected from the North Pacific were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the ingested plastic in their gut content (Tanaka et al. 2013) and myctophid fish collected from the South Atlantic were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the plastic debris in the region (Rochman et al. 2014b). These observational data suggest that plastic-associated chemicals from plastic do transfer to wildlife upon ingestion. This hypothesis has been further investigated in controlled laboratory studies, providing a stronger weight of evidence. Two studies demonstrated the bioaccumulation of additive PBDEs in crickets (Acheta domesticus; Gaylor et al. 2012) and amphipods (Allorchestes compressa; Chua et al. 2014) as a result of the ingestion of plastic. Another study showed greater concentrations of PCBs in lugworms exposed to contaminated sediment with polystyrene as opposed to contaminated sediment without plastic, suggesting that the existence of the plastic in the experiment facilitated the transfer of chemicals to lugworms (Arenicola marina; Besseling et al. 2013). Another laboratory study demonstrated that both additive chemicals and chemicals that accumulate in nature (nonylphenol, phenanthrene, PBDE-47 and triclosan) desorb from PVC and can transfer into the tissues of lugworms upon ingestion (A. marina; Browne et al. 2013). Lastly, a study measuring the bioaccumulation of POPs sorbed to plastics demonstrated the transfer of chrysene, PCB 28 and several congeners of PBDEs to fish from the ingestion of polyethylene pellets (Rochman et al. 2013b). Thus, there is strong evidence showing that chemical contaminants can bioaccumulate in marine life when plastic debris is ingested. What remains less understood, is whether these plastic-associated contaminants biomagnify in higher trophic level animals as a direct result of plastic ingestion (potentially leading to bioaccumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in seafood; Fig. 5.3) and how important bioaccumulation from plastic is relative to bioaccumulation from other sources of chemical contamination in the environment (e.g. chemical contamination that is ubiquitous in water, sediments and food webs globally; Ross and Birnbaum 2010). Still, the fact that chemicals from plastic debris can transfer to marine animals begs the question, how do these chemicals associated with plastic debris impact marine organisms?"
260,276,0.334,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"these concerns, ranaviruses that infect amphibians and Epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) are listed as notifiable agents by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE, Schloegel et al. 2010). Despite the global awareness of ranaviruses, the distribution of ranaviruses and their effects on host populations and international commerce remain poorly understood. Further, there is limited information on the mechanisms that affect hostâ ranavirus interactions and factors that lead to mortality events (Gray et al. 2009). Various field studies and controlled experiments are expanding our knowledge of ranaviruses (Duffus et al. 2015; Brunner et al. 2015; Jancovich et al. 2015b); however, more research is needed. Properly designed studies (Gray et al. 2015) are a first step to investigating hypotheses associated with ranavirus emergence. Use of appropriate diagnostic techniques is key to identifying ranavirus infections and determining the effects of infection on host species. Understanding the differential diagnoses for ranaviral disease is important, and combining infection data with pathological and environmental information is essential to confirm that ranavirus is the etiologic disease agent. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of the gross and microscopic lesions associated with ranaviral disease followed by a discussion of the current diagnostic tests in use by research and veterinary diagnostic laboratories worldwide. We point out the limitations of certain diagnostic techniques, and identify needed areas of improvement. Finally, we briefly discuss research into treatment and vaccine development for ranaviruses."

All species are known to vary widely or fluctuate in population levels in accordance with varying environmental conditions from year to year. In addition to these natural fluctuations, shrimp harvests also have been affected by exogenous factors, such as rising fuel costs, market competition from imported shrimp, and fleet damage from hurricanes. Overall, the shrimp populationsâthe most valuable of all Gulf shellfish speciesâseem to be flourishing, while the shrimp fishery is in decline due to these and other factors (Figure 1.10). Oysters show the same annual environmental fluctuations, but the fishery appears to be fairly stable overall, except for hurricane damage in some places and a decadal decline in stock assessment in Louisiana (Figure 1.11).

The majority of citizen science studies (68 %) examined the spatial distribution and composition of marine litter (Table 16.1). In these cases, citizens participated in beach cleanup activities or beach surveys of marine litter (e.g. Gregory 1991; Storrier et al. 2007), plastic beverage containers (JÃ³zwiak 2005) and small plastic debris (Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2013). Apart from one study conducted by divers in subtidal environments (Smith and Edgar 2014), the intertidal zone was the only sampling zone. One citizen-science study also covered the open ocean via a drifter experiment to investigate the pathways of litter from island areas in Hawaii; citizen scientists reported drifters that had stranded on local shores (Carson et al. 2013). In most cases, data were registered on datasheets provided by an organization, but one study also created a smartphone application, which was used by personal phones and iPods (Martin 2013). Interaction of marine litter with biota was the second most common topic addressed by citizen science studies, but given the overwhelming proportion of studies on the distribution and composition of litter (68 %), this topic represented only 18 % of all studies (Table 16.1).

As is typical of risk assessments of pesticides, this exercise required a range of expertise. The panel consisted of seven scientists with experience in environmental fate of organic molecules and associated simulation modeling, toxicity of pesticides to aquatic and terrestrial organisms, environmental chemodynamics, and ecological risk assessment. The panel developed conceptual models and an analysis plan that addressed the issues identified by the registrant, the panel, and in the problem formulation process developed by the USEPA. All panel members participated in all aspects of the problem formulation and goal-setting for the assessment. Individual experts took the lead in conducting various portions of the assessment. The assessment built upon the findings of the previous assessments, updated the data sets available, and applied the most current methods and models for assessing risks. The panel met several times over the period 2011â2013, discussed the findings of the various teams, and then prepared a series of peer-reviewed manuscripts, which are published together as a series in this volume of RECT.

169,791,0.333,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Global standards in statistical modeling were applied to rigorously establish bioindicators as management tools that link sets of species (ï¬sh and benthic invertebrates) with water quality parameters (Fig. 27.1), implemented by stakeholders involved in the SUSFISH project. However, these sustainability challenges are wider than ecology. For example, artiï¬cial aquatic ecosystems like reservoirs are novel landscape elements that alter the social, cultural, and economic features of local communities and their approaches to natural resources management. In Burkina resource users pursue ï¬sh conservation with little governmental support (Butterworth et al. 2010), but little is known as to how far local people can assume responsibility to manage waters and ï¬sh (Ouedraogo 2010). Fishing communities remain poor despite the emergence of ï¬shing income to complement their many other economic activities. Furthermore, despite research over the past decade, e.g., the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme in West Africa (FAO IDAF; e.g., Fabio et al. 2003), much research remains to understand their livelihoods and food security strategies as professional groups, households, and individuals. In addition, development research in Africa has a tragic history of narrowly focusing on technical methods whose use terminates with the end of each project and never become integrated into the policy and practice of society (Raynaut 1997; Batterbury and Warren 2001). Even if the capacity to monitor ï¬sheries does become established, the"

389,85,0.333,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"The 137Cs aCR in zooplankton collected off the JobanâSanriku coast varied from 5 to 276, and the median value increased with time from 12, measured in July 2011, to 29, measured in August 2011, and to 115, measured in August 2012 (Fig. 3.2c). In Sendai Bay, the aCR varied between 5 and 1,280 throughout the study period. Because of the large variation in 137Cs concentrations among zooplankton samples, aCR also varied within each sampling period in Sendai Bay. The aCR monthly median value increased from 16, measured in June 2011, to 335 in December 2011 and fluctuated by more than 80, up to 854 in August 2012 and 730 in September 2012. The 137Cs aCR of zooplankton increased over time, although it varied significantly between months (Fig. 3.2c). In NovemberâDecember 2013, the median aCR value (262) was more than one order of magnitude higher than CR values obtained before the FNPP accident, which ranged from 6 to 14 (Kaeriyama et al. 2008a). The increase in aCR was mainly associated with differences in the rate of decrease of Cs in seawater and zooplankton, as was clearly observed in Sendai Bay. The continuous uptake of 137Cs by zooplankton may lead to a slow rate of decrease of 137Cs in zooplankton. Figure 3.4a conceptually shows the temporal change in 137Cs expected in seawater and zooplankton following a release of large quantities of 137Cs, similar to the FNPP accident. The concentration of 137Cs in seawater is expected to increase soon after the release, and the increase in 137Cs in zooplankton is observed after that (phase I). A sharp peak of 137Cs is observed in seawater samples, followed by an exponential decrease with time (phase II). On the other hand, the maximum concentration of 137Cs in zooplankton is expected to be delayed from the peak of 137Cs concentration in seawater and to gradually decrease with time (phase III). A time lag in the 137Cs concentration between seawater and zooplankton leads to temporal changes in aCR observed in zooplankton (Fig. 3.4b). Eventually, the rate of decrease of 137Cs in seawater and zooplankton equalizes, and the zooplankton aCR reaches the same level as the CR before the release of 137Cs to the environment (phase IV). The dynamic equilibrium of 137Cs between zooplankton and the surrounding seawater is attained during phase IV. Figure 3.4c shows the relationship between seawater Cs and aCR in zooplankton resulting from the temporal changes shown in Fig. 3.4a, b. The relationship between seawater 137Cs concentration and 137Cs zooplankton aCR in this study along with those obtained from previous studies con-"

232,51,0.333,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"3 Loss, Damage and Victims The term âlossâ is used to designate the consequences of degradation. In some areas, these consequences can be anticipated, while in others they cannot. For example, in an armed conflict the intentional bombing of a military building can lead to its destruction. While this may have been the intention of those who undertook the action, it can also destroy buildings or injure people who were not the target. This is referred to as âcollateral damageâ.5 In this case âdamageâ is most meaningful when injury has been caused to a person or group, their property, or an environment (if there is an interest in claiming compensation). Losses can be immediate or longer term. When it concerns a person, group, non-human living species, or an environment the term âvictimâ must take on a broader meaning. Not only can it be used to designate people, but also living or non-living entities that have representatives who are able to speak on their behalf. For example, the quality of a coastline is said to be degraded following an oil spill and the media do not hesitate to describe the shoreline as a âvictimâ. Bees are another example. This living species is the victim of agricultural chemicals, or, as described in a French newspaper, the âvictim of the lack of biodiversityâ.6 Finally, before work-related accident legislation was implemented, there were no ofï¬cial victims of occupational accidents or illnesses. They could not be acknowledged until dangerous working conditions or hazardous machinery was recognised. Similarly, an analysis of breakdowns due to human factors can be seen as the clumsy (or even malicious) use of machines by operators. In general terms, there are no non-human victims. Instead, they are represented by individuals or groups who speak on their behalf and defend their interests before an authority that is responsible for estimating the loss they have suffered."
133,124,0.333,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Tobacco and Alcohol Consumption Tobacco is still known as âthe single largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United Statesâ (CDC 2012). This is the case in EU countries as well, where smoking has been described as âthe most important cause of gender differences in mortality across Europeâ (McCartney et al. 2011). Levels of alcohol consumption are more heterogeneous across countries (La Vecchia et al. 2014). The contribution of alcohol consumption to mortality is between 3 and 8% in EU countries (Rehm et al. 2009), and is up to 10% at working ages in the United States (Stahre et al. 2014). There is compelling evidence that there are gender differences in both the prevalence and the levels of alcohol consumption. Across all western countries, more men than women consume tobacco and alcohol (Costanza et al. 2006; Robinson and Harris 2011), and the consumption of these substances has greater effects on health and survival among men than among women at the aggregated level (Mucha et al. 2006; Stahre et al. 2014). Men have been shown to have a greater propensity than women to engage in risky behaviors, and the link between risky behaviors and the social concept of masculinity appears to underlie the sex differences in the consumption of both alcohol and tobacco. For instance, in a qualitative study of young men in London alcohol consumption was described as a marker of masculinity (De Visser and Smith 2007). As gender-based double"
337,75,0.332,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"uses including logging is detailed and is enforced in Oregon leading to intensive management of forestry ecosystems (Boyle et al. 1997), compared to rampant unregulated and highly destructive deforestation in Papua New Guinea (Bryan et al. 2010). These examples illustrate a remarkable contrast. The threats to humanityâs future are often clear from the scientific evidence. Environment and sustainability problems can be solved and have been solved in some locations. Other locations do not apply the available knowledge for action while some new problems continue to emerge. Overall, the conclusion is that society has been unable or unwilling to take comprehensive steps to address the well-documented and continuing environmental and sustainability challenges, including with respect to resource management. One difficulty in making sense of the scientific evidence and applying it for concerted action is the large degree of disciplinary silos. Plenty is published on, for instance, factors influencing pollutant transport to the Arctic (e.g. Downie and Fenge 2003; Eckhardt et al. 2003), but the work has varying levels of engagement with different disciplines and varying levels of resultant action from the knowledge. Sometimes, publications provide only a physical or chemical description without connection to any form of social science or policy. That is not inherently detrimental, since the physical science is a needed input and deserves publication in its own right. Nevertheless, much more than physical science is needed to understand societyâs interaction with resources and the environmentâand how to inspire and formulate action addressing the problems identified. Often, caught in their disciplinary silos, physical scientists will aim for full and comprehensive knowledge of a problem before being willing to recommend any form of action. Social science indicates that is not necessary, since techniques for decisionmaking under uncertainty exist alongside approaches for selecting action pathways which are likely to be beneficial over the long-term irrespective of the uncertainties and irrespective of what is not known. In fact, many positive examples exist of tackling sustainability problems without full physical science knowledge. These examples emerge from recent history, such as cleaning up Lake Erie and The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer mentioned above. Current initiatives exist as well. As a prominent example, little scientific doubt exists regarding observations about contemporary climate change and the human influences on it (IPCC 2007). Much work remains to be completed regarding, amongst other physical science challenges, feedback mechanisms from clouds (Dessler 2010) and the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones (Knutson et al. 2010). Supporting such physical science research would not only better understand the ultimate consequences of climate change, but would also highlight the importance of supporting curiosity-driven research with its unknown, and often spectacular, gains for humanity. While that research is ongoing, many communities are nonetheless taking action on their own, based on what is known, irrespective of the uncertainties and any knowledge limits. Despite, or perhaps because of, any scientific uncertainties regarding climate change, Transition Towns (Barry and Quilley 2009) and relocalization movements (Kelman 2008) aim to transform entire cities toward pathways that are sustainable, irrespective of the climate pathway which emerges.

260,39,0.332,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ambystoma tigrinum virus was first described in larval Sonora tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi) collected from the San Rafael Valley in Arizona, USA in 1995 (Jancovich et al. 1997). This virus was isolated from a population that had both apparently healthy and visibly diseased salamander larvae (Jancovich et al. 1997). The virus that was later isolated was successfully transmitted to healthy individuals via the water, as well as through the feeding of body parts of infected animals to healthy individuals in the laboratory (Jancovich et al. 1997). After fulfilling Kochâs Postulates, it was determined that ATV was the causative agent of the disease found in the tiger salamander larvae and the likely cause of recurrent epizootics first described in 1985 (Collins et al. 1988). Ambystoma tigrinum virus in the wild appears to be restricted to western North America (Jancovich et al. 2005; Ridenhour and Storfer 2008). Phylogeographic studies of ATV strains suggest local range expansion and long-distance colonization events, which may be attributed to anthropogenic spread (Jancovich et al. 2005). ATV is found in tiger salamander larvae sold commercially as fish bait (Picco and Collins 2008), providing an anthropogenic explanation for range expansion. Because of the potential for introduction, ATV may be a threat to naÃ¯ve urodeles of conservation concern. In the lab, the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) is susceptible to ATV and experienced mortality associated with infection (Picco et al. 2007). There have been no reports of ATV infections or associated mortality in wild California tiger salamanders, probably due in part to the ban on importation of non-native Ambystomatidae into the state. Patterns of ATV infection are more similar among ponds in the same year, rather than between years (Greer et al. 2009). In natural populations of tiger salamanders located on the Kaibab Plateau in the Northern Kaibab National Forest in Arizona, outbreaks of ATV appear to be synchronous (Greer et al. 2009). Interestingly, despite four years of observation, no visible signs of disease were seen, even in cases where the infection rate in the pond was greater than 50 % (Greer et al. 2009). It is thought that the lack of observed morbidity and mortality in these populations is due to coevolution between ATV and the host (Greer et al. 2009). This may be the case as there is evidence of local adaptation in ATV strains isolated from the western USA (Ridenhour and Storfer 2008)."

169,807,0.332,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"27.5.2 Socioeconomic Factors Inï¬uencing Fishery Sustainability As previously noted, SUSFISH was founded in recognition of the history of failure of development projects grounded only on technical and/or scientiï¬c advances. In BF alone we found examples of failure to adopt modernizing technology in the form of abandoned equipment and infrastructure (ï¬sh ponds, refrigerators, ï¬sh weighing scales, ï¬sh shops). For that reason SUSFISH sponsored research into the social, economic, and political barriers and bridges the gap to sustainable ï¬sheries. Our research indicates that, while some encouraging examples exist, there are abundant barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries provided by challenges of governance at multiple levels in BF. Our results conï¬rm that ï¬sh size and ï¬sh community diversity are associated with the degree and quality of management, both of ï¬sheries directly and of the habitat surrounding the ï¬shery. For example, the Nazinga site has relatively unimpacted habitat (land management) and has a closed ï¬shing season that is well-regulated (ï¬sheries management), and it has signiï¬cantly larger ï¬sh and a higher share in adult ï¬sh than any other sampling site. Furthermore, both ï¬sh and BMI diversity are higher in protected areas, e.g., Nazinga, Mare aux Hippo than in others. Just as important to biodiversity conservation as the legal content of policy is its execution at the appropriate level (subsidiarity) by well-organized and led local actors. For example, in Moussodougou the ï¬sheries are directly controlled by a local association that effectively enforces rules. Situations with effective management are associated with an increased biomasses and abundance with large ï¬sh specimens. A prominent overarching challenge is that it appears that ï¬sheries management is not equally applied all over BF but is concentrated in a few large reservoirs of ânational economic interest,â e.g., Ziga, Bagre, Kompienga, and Sourou. Fishing in these large water bodies is dominated by commercial ï¬shermen, who are regulated and in good communication with government ofï¬cers. However, elsewhere in BF communication is not so good for management organs devoted to smaller reservoirs, except for four ï¬shing concessions given to the associations of the local ï¬shermen (Bapla, Moussodougou, Tandjari, and Lera). Aside from these few examples of successful organization of local management capacity, for the most part, there are gaps between national and lower levels of governance. Brieï¬y, a governance system that effectively functions from the central, national level out to the regional and local levels has yet to be established. Often the link between law and practices to monitor ï¬sheries is missing (law is not adopted in practice). Therefore there is little effective police monitoring or enforcement of ï¬shing practices at the lower levels, e.g., smaller-scale ï¬sheries. While efforts to decentralize management authority have been underway for years, the failure to comprehensively bridge institutions from national to local levels is hampered by the frequency of shifts of governance responsibilities (institutional nomadism) for ï¬sheries management at the national level. One salient example of the poor communication that results from such âadministrative ï¬uxâ is the general"

Lastly, as noted above, ranaviruses may persist in the environment long enough to be transmitted to naÃ¯ve hosts. Perhaps more importantly, fish, amphibians and reptiles often overlap with other, less susceptible or more abundant species that act as biotic reservoirs for the species of interest. Collectively, there is good reason to think that ranaviruses can lead to host extinction (Miller et al. 2011). In spite of this potential for ranaviruses to cause host extinctions, it is difficult to find specific examples of ranavirus leading to regional or global extinctions or, until recently, declines. Few long-term datasets exist that have followed wild populations of ectothermic vertebrates with reoccurring die-offs from ranavirus, and at least for amphibians, long datasets are often required to be certain of declines (Alford and Richards 1999). To some degree this may be explained by the fact that ranaviruses often affect the larval or juvenile stages (see Sects. 2.1 and 3.3) and for many taxa these stages can be less important demographically than adults (Biek et al. 2002). We would thus expect populations or species where the adults were most affected by ranaviruses to display the greatest declines (but see Earl and Gray 2014). Indeed, Teacher et al. (2010) reported an 81 % median reduction in population abundance of common frog (Rana temporaria) adults at ponds in the UK with known reoccurring die-offs from ranaviral disease. Again, ranaviruses in the UK appear to primarily affect adults (Cunningham et al. 1993; Teacher et al. 2010; Duffus et al. 2013). Similarly, the significant ranavirus mortality observed in adult turtles presumably puts these populations at increased risk of extinction as well (Belzer and Seibert 2011; Farnsworth and Seigel 2013). Repeated ranavirus epidemics in larval amphibians may also lead to declines and local extinctions. Petranka et al. (2003, 2007), for instance, reported minimal recruitment of wood frogs at several newly constructed wetlands over an 8-year period due to annual die-offs from ranaviral disease. Recently, Earl and Gray (2014) used a matrix population-projection model to demonstrate that local extirpation of a closed wood frog population was likely if larvae or metamorphs were exposed to ranavirus once every 5 years. For populations that were exposed every year, time to extinction could be as rapid as 5 years (Earl and Gray 2014). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that survival of the pre-metamorphic stages was more important than post-metamorphic stages for the wood frog, providing initial evidence that significant mortality of larvae due to ranavirus could lead to population extinction (Earl and Gray 2014). Susceptible species in fragmented landscapes with limited dispersal may be at greater risk of extinction than has been previously recognized (Collins and Crump 2009). The most compelling example of recurring ranavirus epidemics leading to amphibian declines comes from the Picos de Europa National park in Spain (Price et al. 2014). These communities were monitored for six years, during which ranaviruses were apparently introduced, leading to significant declines over the following years. What makes these virus-host community interactions different from others that have not suffered declines remains unknown. Clearly, there is a need for more studies of the population-level effects of ranavirus outbreaks, particularly long-term studies of sites with reoccurring ranavirus die-offs (Gray et al. 2015)."

364,246,0.332,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"The incidence of food insecurity can be viewed as the ultimate effect of several inter-related biophysical and socio-economic factors that comprise the main hazards and risks. Environmental degradation, for example, may be caused by a combination of manâs interaction with physical resources and naturally occurring hazards. It is evident in all the sites that the declining land resource base is adversely affecting farm and fishery householdsâ incomes and livelihoods, resulting in the threat of food insufficiency for the poorest. Across sites, households perceive that continued occurrence of climatic and other natural events in the years to come will have a major impact on their incomes, family health, food security, and the circumstances of the community as a whole. With these issues in mind, the following technical and policy concerns should be taken into consideration to develop a research agenda that would facilitate the creation of a plan for managing watersheds and implementing related strategies. 1. Developing an integrated approach to watershed management that covers both land and water resources entails convening the major stakeholders to: (1) develop and agree on a common vision, goals, and objectives for managing the watershed and lake resources (e.g., improved water quality for a given period of time); (2) identify issues and problems that may hinder the fulfilment of the vision, goals, and objectives; and (3) prioritize and develop an agreed action plan for dealing with the identified problems and/or constraints. 2. In trying to address issues relating to soil and land degradation, it is important to determine whether the causes are anthropogenic or geogenic, since the potential solutions would be different. For example, many problems related to soil and land degradation can be traced to watershed management practices that are dictated by stakeholdersâ socio-economic circumstances. Of research interest, therefore, are studies on the appropriateness of different technologies given different physical and biological conditions of the soil. Technologies that address different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions among farmers might include re-vegetation, erosion control measures, water conservation, agroforestry systems, organic farming, and use of organic pesticides. 3. When developing plans for the watershed areas, addressing poverty and providing the means to make a living at the household level should be a major consideration, given our understanding of the relationships between land and water resources"

36,175,0.332,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"and high densities of dead trees appear to be strongly correlated with the presence of roosts of bark and cavity-roosting bats in forested ecosystems across North America (Mattson et al. 1996; Sasse and Pekins 1996; Rabe et al. 1998; Waldien et al. 2000; Cryan et al. 2001; Bernardos et al. 2004; Broders and Forbes 2004; Miles et al. 2006; Perry and Thill 2007b; Arnett and Hayes 2009). The importance of high roost density has also been reported in Australia. In dry Jarrah forest of Western Australia, both Gouldâs long-eared bat, Nyctophilus gouldi, and the southern forest bat, Vespadelus regulus, preferred roosting in older forest that contained a much higher density of trees with hollows (16â32 trees haâ1) than shelterwood creation and gap release sites (8â12 trees haâ1) (Webala et al. 2010). These mature forest hollow tree densities are comparable to average densities of live and dead hollow trees in roost areas used by Gouldâs wattled bat, Chalinolobus gouldii, (17 haâ1) and the lesser long-eared bat, N. geoffroyi, (18 haâ1) in a fragmented landscape in south-eastern Australia (Lumsden et al. 2002). Greater densities of hollow trees likely facilitate roost switching in bark and cavityroosting bats or fissionâfusion behaviours (Kerth and KÃ¶nig 1999; Willis and Brigham 2004). These behaviours lead to complex patterns of use and movement among available roost trees by colonies of forest bats. The variation in numbers of roosts between core and peripheral areas of roost networks is further influenced by the density and spatial distribution of available roost trees, as demonstrated for Rafinesqueâs big-eared bat, Corynorhinus rafinesquii, in south-eastern bottomland hardwood forests of North America (Johnson et al. 2012b). Roost networks of northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, in actively managed forests were scale-free and connected to a single central-node roost tree (Johnson et al. 2012a). A similar pattern was observed for the open-space foraging white-striped free-tail bat, Tadarida australis, in south-east Queensland (Rhodes et al. 2006). Given these patterns, we postulate that implementation of silvicultural systems, which promote retention of higher densities of dead and old living trees across forested ecosystems, should benefit bark- and cavity-roosting bats and facilitate ânatural patternsâ in colony behaviours, social interactions, and the use of roost networks."

Increases in Excoecaria and Bruguiera might also be beneficial for ecosystem services such as soil formation and retention along with organic matter and nutrient enrichment in the forest floor. However, on the whole since the forest extent is predicted to decline by the end of 2100, the magnitude of ecosystem services is expected to decline, especially from those species which are less salt tolerant."

376,345,0.331,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","A reduction in access to key resource areas would cause livestock numbers to decline over the course of several years, especially during drought periods. In contrast, an abundance of non-key resources is likely to occur during the wet season, because animal numbers have been reduced by a scarcity of, and competition for, high-quality forage during the dry season. This interpretation establishes that livestock are closely coupled to forage resources, for at least part of the year, to meet their energy and nutrient requirements for survival, growth, and reproduction. This interpretation has been experimentally corroborated in a pastoral system located in an arid and highly stochastic environment (Hempson et al. 2015). In this investigation, livestock body condition followed density-dependent depletion of the limited dry-season riverine vegetation (key resources), and annual demographic parameters of animal populations tracked dry-season conditions. Dry-season length and previous population size were the main determinants of the animal population trajectory, with no clear evidence for an effect of growing season conditions over the vast area accessible to them. Therefore, wet-season rangeland can be categorized as nonequilibrium, because animal populations are only loosely coupled with it, but livestock do exist in equilibrium with dry-season resources. Implications to Grazing Management. Reinterpretation of the NEP model has several important implications for management of livestock grazing. It indicates that the potential for grazing to modify vegetation and potentially degrade rangeland resources during the wet season increases as the proportion of key dryseason resource areas increases because it is these resources that establish the maximum number of livestock supported over the long term. Consequently, a high ratio of key dry:wet-season resources could support livestock numbers which are sufficient to produce high grazing intensities on wet-season resources, even though they may not be in equilibrium with them. Key resource areas themselves are obviously of considerable importance, and since they represent an equilibrial part of the grazed ecosystem they generally respond to increasing grazing intensity through reduced productivity and altered species composition (von Wehrden et al. 2012; Muthoni et al. 2014). These negative vegetation impacts will likely have direct, negative feedbacks on animal populations as described by traditional grazing management. Commercial ranching represents a situation where livestock are often provided with supplemental feed during the dry or winter season to minimize animal mortality and weight loss. In these cases, livestock numbers would become uncoupled from both wet- and dry-season resources because grazing intensity is determined by animal numbers maintained by supplemental feeding. The maintenance of high livestock numbers during these periods increases the potential to adversely impact vegetation during the growing season and it reduces the opportunity for vegetation recovery following drought compared with less intensively managed systems. In principle, this interpretation would also apply to wild herbivores that migrate from wet-season (summer) resources to dry-season resources during the winter and then return to wet-season resources. Vegetation on summer range would be impacted to the extent that resource availability in winter range can support total animal numbers."

255,271,0.331,Railway Ecology,"Abstract The extensive network of the Indian Railways cuts through several forested landscapes, resulting in collisions of trains with a variety of wildlife species, including the largest land mammalâthe elephant. In India, railway lines cross elephant habitats in several states, with accidents that resulted in more than 200 elephant deaths between 1987 and 2015. As the 161-km SiliguriâAlipurduar track in the northern West Bengal state witnesses trainâelephant collisions frequently, we developed a case study there with the objectives of mapping locations of collisions and generating a susceptibility map showing locations prone to accidents. We mapped elephant crossing points and movement paths along this railway track, as well as accident locations. Between 1974 and 2015, collisions occurred throughout the line, although there were several hotspots where elephant deaths were concentrated. A disproportionate number of accidents occurred during the night. Crop raiding in villages and train elephant accidents seem to be closely related, probably due to an increased frequency of elephant movement near or across this railway track during the cultivation season. Male elephants were much more prone to accidents, possibly because of behavioural characteristics that make them cross railway tracks more frequently. To reduce the frequency of accidents in this region, we recommend reducing the speed of trains, limiting the operation of trains during at night, provisioning overpasses and underpasses, using communications technology, realigning a portion of the track, and fencing the track except for corridor areas."

376,779,0.331,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Antagonistic interactions, or trade-offs, indicate that management practices or events that increase one type of ecosystem service may negatively affect other ecosystem services (OÃ±atibia et al. 2015). For example, land management practices that lead to increases in the provisioning of food may result in a reduction of clean water purification, creating trade-offs in the provisioning of ecosystem services (RaudseppHearne et al. 2010). Planting trees to increase carbon sequestration or timber production may decrease stream flow in arid areas and represents a trade-off (Nosetto et al. 2008). In summary, ecosystem service research has advanced to identify nature as a complex provider of human benefits (MA 2005). The rangelands of Patagonia provide an example of trade-offs and winâwin relationships among ecosystem services depending on management. An example of winâ win is the maximization of carbon, nitrogen, and forage availability at intermediate grazing intensities (Fig. 14.4). A critical provision service, such as forage biomass, is"

182,99,0.33,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"research and practice. This, in turn, prompted wider transformationsâ in the zoosâ physical structures as post-mortem rooms and more sanitary animal enclosures were built; in their ânaturalâ landscapes as unhealthy swamps were drained; and in their social organization, as new staff were employed to manage health and investigate disease. The health of zoo animals therefore provides a unique perspective on the history of the zoo and its animal inhabitants. In health, disease and death, zoo animals inspired medical men to engage with them, both directly within the zoo, and remotely via the traces they left on the medical record. This chapter has revealed how both humans and animals were produced through these relationships. Animals were transformed into patients, victims of their environments, pathological material, and points of comparison across species, while human doctors became healers and investigators of animals. In the process, perceptions of what it meant to be human or animal changed. âIn-houseâ efforts to improve animal health proceeded on the basis that animals were sufficiently close to humans to permit the application, by doctors, of ideas and practices drawn from human medical contexts. In practice, however, animalsâ resistance to handling and their unusual anatomiesâwhich attracted medical attention independently of the pathologies they displayedâplaced limits on the wholesale importation of human medicine into the zoo. Likewise, while investigations into comparative pathology reinforced notions that humans and animals (particularly monkeys) were sufficiently similar to allow deductions about the former to be drawn from the latter, they also highlighted key differences that were attributed to, and served to consolidate ideas about, their evolutionary relationships. In these ways, the practice of medicine within the zoo simultaneously brought humans and animals closer together, and demarcated the distances between them. Medical interventions in the zoo also had implications for animal, and to a lesser extent, human health. Some of the zoosâ more valuable mammalian inhabitants probably did benefit from zoological society efforts, especially those directed towards environmental improvements. Mortality statistics are not particularly useful in revealing such benefits because they refer to all species. Also, it should be noted that without medical interventions, mortality rates may have been even higher. Rickets provides the best example of a disease whose management in humans was advanced through investigations performed on zoo animals. However, this chapter has provided many other examples of doctors"

169,854,0.33,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"speciï¬c restoration strategies, and, lastly, integrating those again into effective management programs are a challenging task. Legacy effects have to be considered as human interventions may go back for several 100 years (see Chap. 2). Humans have polluted rivers since the ï¬rst larger population agglomerations were established. Sewage treatment plants are known to combat pollution efï¬ciently. However, diffuse inputs from agriculture require alternative land management strategies and protection of riparian vegetation and ï¬oodplains (see Chaps. 10 and 13). Toxicants still represent a relevant stressor in river ecosystems, despite major improvements of the situation over the last decades, at least in regions with a strong governmental regulation. Intelligent strategies are required to deal with how exposure to toxicants is complicated by mixtures, multiple stressors, and other features of the environmental context that all inï¬uence the magnitude of potential negative effects (see Chap. 12). Scale dependencies and upstream/downstream effects are evident in all riverine ecosystem elements. Long-term ï¬ow alterations may be as critical as short-term alterations (see Chaps. 4 and 5). Sediment seems to be as important as ï¬ow, but understanding of sediment processes lags behind, making it difï¬cult to identify effective and sustainable mitigation measures (see Chap. 8). While building ï¬sh passes is supposed to be an adequate mitigation measure for continuity disruptions, their efï¬ciency, in particular, for downstream migration, is still questionable. Furthermore, the overall response of ï¬sh communities to multiple stressors in the context of multi-fragmented, river systems has to be explored in more detail (see Chap. 9). By restoring habitats, providing environmental ï¬ow, and building ï¬sh passes, we can improve habitat quality and connectivity. However, some impacts are not reversible or are hard to mitigate. Large dams cause such altered ecosystems since dams fundamentally change former riverine ecosystems into lake-type or hybrid systems, and restoration measures are, in general, limited here (see Chaps. 6 and 24). In addition to the challenges described above, our current understanding of causal relationships underpinning ecological processes becomes increasingly obsolete over time and needs revision, as the environmental conditions drift away from ânaturalâ conditions due to climate change (see Chap. 11). Many methods and successful applications of river restoration at local scales are presented in this book. However, comprehensive restoration of running water is lacking in most of the rivers worldwide. We are increasingly running the risk of losing the necessary free space to experimentally explore alternative restoration interventions. For example, river widening, as one of the favorite morphological restoration measures, requires space that is increasingly becoming the limiting factor, particularly in areas with natural constraints and high levels of development, such as the Alps. But even if land is available, land owners have to be convinced, subsidies provided, and implementation procedures developed to be successful. Strategic planning at catchment and even larger scales is necessary to cope with conï¬icting interests and new infrastructure development. However, even with best intensions and maximal support, we might not be able to signiï¬cantly restore heavily impacted rivers in all cases due to how society (acceptance of existing land uses) and ecosystems have shifted over time and become irreversibly locked into a new regime. Accepting this fact may redirect our"

Subrahmanyam et al. (1976) sampled infauna and epifauna in two Florida black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) marshes, at Wakulla and St. Marks. Four major groups comprised the invertebrate community, including crustaceans (44 %), mollusks (31 %), annelids (24 %), and insect larvae (1 %). Numerically dominant taxa included the marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata), the isopod Cyathura polita, and the polychaete Scoloplos fragilis. Pure stands of black needlerush, intertidal smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), and salt grass (Distichlis spicata) were sampled by Ivester (1978) for invertebrate community comparisons along a salt flat in Alabama. A total of 19 taxa were identified, along with unidentified oligochaetes and insects. Six species represented over 90 % of total numbers of the community in each zone. Marsh periwinkle (L. irrorata) and the mussel, Guekensia demissa, were important only in smooth cordgrass. Marsh periwinkle was replaced by the gastropod Melampus bidentatus and increased numbers of the gastropod Neritina reclivata in black needlerush and salt grass stands. The bivalve Polymesoda caroliniana was prevalent in needlerush, as seen in both north Florida (Subrahmanyam et al. 1976) and Mississippi (Humphrey 1979). Oligochaetes dominated each of the three plant community types, ranging in relative abundance from 80 % in smooth cordgrass to 53 % in salt grass. Epifauna utilize salt marsh tidal creeks in addition to the vegetated marsh surface, often entering vegetated areas after inundation by tides. Nektonic epifauna typically include grass shrimp (Palaemontes spp.), white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus), brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus), and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). These important decapod fishery species are seasonally abundant in salt marshes of the northern GoM coast (Zimmerman and Minello 1984; Thomas et al. 1990; Peterson and Turner 1994). Remarkably similar nekton assemblages occur in the tidal channels and ponds of Spartina-dominated marshes of Louisiana and Texas and the Juncus-dominated marshes in the northeastern GoM (Subrahmanyam and Drake 1975; Subrahmanyam and Coultas 1980). Most nekton studies conducted in marshes of the GoM have emphasized samples collected from the interface (edge, with 5 to 10 m) between vegetated marsh and adjacent open water habitats and usually used drop samplers deployed from the bow of a boat (Baltz et al. 1993; Minello et al. 1994; Minello 1999; Minello and Rozas 2002; Zeug et al. 2007). Nekton samples collected at or near the marsh edge included species that use the flooded interior marsh surface as well as those that tend to be associated with nearshore shallow water. Thus, samples collected only from the marsh edge may not distinguish among assemblages of nekton that actually make"

Biology. Fiji sago palm does not produce suckers and reproduces only through a single fruiting before it dies. It may also have the longest period of growth â germinating seed to mature fruit of 25 years or more. Such a life history renders it vulnerable to catastrophic events â cyclones, new pests, new human uses, etc. Vulnerability increases as the stand size decreases. 2. Drainage for agriculture and land use needs. Ongoing, presumably since the first arrival of humans to Fiji, but recently subject to increased agricultural land needs, as well as residential subdivisions in key sago habitats, such as Pacific Harbour (Fig. 10.2)."

The efforts invested in freshwater biodiversity observations and the evaluation of monitoring data must take into account the need to achieve a balance between information needed on individual species of concern with information on other components of biodiversity (such as community composition; Box 7.3, Fig. 7.3a). In prioritising species for monitoring or for repeated or long-term observations, some of the major factors to consider are the level of threat (IUCN Red List status; local classiï¬cations of species at risk or the relevant protected-species legislation); regional freshwater conservation targets; community interest in iconic species or those otherwise of particular concern to humans; and species that are essential as sources of food or habitat for threatened species. Actions that can address the threats to freshwater ecosystems across drainage basins or in broader regions are especially important for conserving biodiversity, but these actions must be prioritised so that resources are spent where greatest beneï¬ts can be achieved. Freshwater conservation planning tools can help this prioritisation (Box 7.3 Fig. 7.3b; also see Linke et al. 2011). Such tools require data"

211,81,0.329,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"opportunities to preserve natural and communal environments to avoid harm to others in the society and the next generation. Finally, changes to natural and communal environments could also put individualsâ needs for autonomy at risk. In order to experience autonomy, individuals need to have a set of available options (Ryan and Deci 2000). However, with deteriorating environmental conditions, peopleâs options usually decrease. For instance, global warming has killed (or is killing) coral reefs (Tourtellot 2007), and climate change has also hindered the growth of crops and other nutritious plants in many areas, thus limiting the amount and diversity of food available throughout the world. Furthermore, when social groups are disturbed, peopleâs options for developing social ties with other individuals, especially other group members, are decreased. Thus, as these examples illustrate, the more natural and communal environmental changes lessen the options individuals have, the more their need for autonomy will remain unmet, and the more they will be inspired to focus on opportunities that preserve the environment. Peopleâs motivation to act on sustainable opportunities seems to increase as their physical and psychological health becomes progressively threatened. That is, the more threatened people feel, the more they tend to direct their attention toward the causes of that threat, and the less attention they tend to direct toward non-threat-related information (McMullen et al. 2009). Thus, when the threat to natural and communal environments is high, individuals are highly likely to act on opportunities to preserve those environments. The threat individuals sense from declining natural and communal environments likely affects the degree to which they combine their knowledge about entrepreneurship and their environmental knowledge to identify a sustainability opportunity. Generally, after individuals perceive a threat and overcome their initial fear response, they thoughtfully search for opportunities to deal with the threat (Beck and Clark 1997). While âelaborative strategic processing of threat,â people process information slowly and a âsecondary appraisal process occurs in which anxious individuals evaluate the availability and effectiveness of their coping resources to deal with the perceived threatâ (Beck and Clark 1997: 53). In other words, individuals whose psychological and physical health is endangered by environmental (natural or communal) deterioration will seek and assess opportunities to handle that threat and, in doing so, will be driven to utilize their prior environmental/communal knowledge as well as their entrepreneurial knowledge. As an individual undertakes assessment activities to deal with a threat, it becomes increasingly"

222,57,0.328,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"It is well established that ecosystem services provide benefits to society in terms of well-being, but less clear how those benefits are distributed in society. A key issue, not least in delta settings, is whether ecosystem services have greater importance for populations with low levels of wellbeing, and whether ecosystem services and their provision can represent a pathway out of poverty. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment proposed that ecosystems bring benefits through maintaining and enhancing the health of people, through life-sustaining goods and services, and through options for use that represent opportunities for development in material and non-material ways. Beyond direct economic use of ecosystem services, benefits include impacts on health through pathways such as nutrition, clean air and clean water, but also psychological well-being. Further elements of well-being can include positive associations with place and identity in constructing meaning and purpose in life and how ecosystems ameliorate risk, providing a safety net and refuge."
222,72,0.328,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This book builds on insights from a multidisciplinary perspective on ecosystem services and their importance to human well-being and applies these ideas in deltas in an integrated manner to inform decision-making for poverty alleviation. There is, of course, a wide variety of approaches and unresolved questions and relationships between elements of wellbeing and the underlying ecosystem processes (Norgaard 2010; Pascual et al. 2017; Suich et al. 2015). But at their core, the key scientific issues relate to how ecosystems bring multiple benefits to society, both in material terms and through other pathways. The benefits from ecosystem services include those associated with direct economic use, with protecting health and mitigation of hazards. The book explores the issues outlined in this chapter in detail for delta environments in order to give context to the broad assessment of the sustainability of a range of possible future trajectories within deltas, focusing on both the biophysical processes of their productivity and the prospects for securing ecosystem services for poverty alleviation objectives. The following chapters also, for the first time, explore in a systematic manner how social processes such as migration, access and property rights, and social relations interact with ecosystem services to result in the distribution of well-being in deltas. The book highlights the leverage points for action on these mechanisms that have been uncovered through integrated modelling and an increased understanding of delta socialecological systems. Integration across diverse knowledge domains and model simulation is a key and novel aspect of the research, and as such the findings in this book, linking biophysical changes to human wellbeing within a coupled model framework. This allows the exploration of possible futures in a participatory and policy-relevant manner that can engage with national stakeholders."

Fruit bats were thus considered to be serious pests and were subsequently killed regularly. According to Spitzenberger (1979), in the past, this involved fumigating roost caves or walling up their entrances. Harrison and Bates (1991) reported that farmers caged their commercial fruit trees in order to protect them from R. aegyptiacus. However, a more recent study in 2012 found that local people in Turkey did not consider bats to be as much of a problem as birds (E. Coraman, pers. comm.). In Cyprus, only anecdotal reports were previously available for the diet of R. aegyptiacus. A preliminary assessment of its diet was carried out by Del Vaglio et al. (2011) from droppings, in order to determine the batsâ real impact on crops. The diet consisted mostly of fruits, several species of which were the same as those reported by Korine et al. (1999) for Israel and Albayrak et al. (2008) for Turkey. The species is an opportunistic forager, with non-native plants forming an important component of its diet, yet Del Vaglio et al. (2011) concluded that its damage to economically important plants in Cyprus is negligible. Their study found that the bat fed mainly on wild fruits and escaped ornamental plants and that only five out of the 11 plant species it consumedâcitrus, fig, loquat, mulberry and plumâwere grown as commercial fruit crops in Cyprus."

This leads to lack of recruitment for riverine ï¬sh populations downstream of the dams. Reservoirs themselves often provide unsuitable habitats for juvenile ï¬sh and ï¬nally represent ecological traps. Four conditions are required to characterize a ï¬sh passage/reservoir system as an ecological trap (Pelicice and Agostinho 2008): (1) attractive forces leading ï¬sh to ascend the passage; (2) unidirectional migratory movements (upstream); (3) the environment above the passage has poor conditions for ï¬sh recruitment, e.g., the absence of spawning grounds and nursery areas; and (4) the environment below the passage has a proper structure for recruitment. When these conditions exist, individuals move to poor-quality habitats, ï¬tness is reduced, and populations are threatened. Based on current and proposed river regulation scenarios, it is concluded that conservation of migratory ï¬sh will be much more complicated than previously believed (Pelicice et al. 2015)."

230,574,0.327,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"of marine ecosystem services, which are estimated at â¬16.5 trillion in one study (Costanza et al. 1997), suggest that even fractional deterioration in provision would represent a significant cost (Beaumont et al. 2007; Galparsoro et al. 2014). Thus far, studies undertaken to estimate the economic impacts of marine litter have generally focused on the direct losses borne by economic activities adversely affected by the presence of marine litter in the environment, within which they operate and rely upon (see Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; MacFayden 2009; McIlgorm et al. 2011). Largely, such studies have not taken into account the often intangible costs of any social and ecological impacts. Some early studies allude to the need for research to explore these costs. For instance, Kirkley and McConnell (1997, p. 185) call for strategies, which account for the economics related to lost ecological functions driven by marine litter. The intricacy of developing such strategies can be illustrated with the example of alien invasive species. Marine litter provides additional opportunities for marine organisms to travel (including alien invasive species) up to threefold (Barnes 2002). Given that the introduction of alien invasive species can have a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems and biodiversity (Kiessling et al. 2015) and can result in serious economic losses to many marine industries, any estimates, which exclude such ecological impacts, will inevitably fall seriously short of the true cost of the marine litter problem. For example, the introduction of the carpet sea squirt (Didemnum vexillum) in Holyhead Harbour (Wales, U.K.) resulted in an eradication and monitoring program over a decade starting in 2009, which was expected to cost â¬670,000. This expenditure was economically justified as allowing the species to spread unpredated and smother organisms and marine habitats would have cost the local mussel fisheries up to â¬8.6 million alone over 10 years (Holt 2009). Goldstein et al. (2014) recorded the ciliate pathogen Halofolliculina (known to cause skeletal eroding band disease in corals) on floating plastic debris in the western Pacific and suggested that the spread of the disease to Caribbean and Hawaiian corals may be due to rafting on the enormous quantities of litter reported from the area. Increased coral mortality or the introduction of other pathogens via floating marine debris may lead to economic costs, for example through decreased revenues due to falling numbers of visiting tourists. Despite their partial coverage, the studies that are available provide sufficient information to draw a number of important conclusions. The main economic sectors, which have been identified from the literature as being affected by marine litter are agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, commercial shipping and recreational boating, coastal municipalities, coastal tourism sector and the emergency rescue services (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010). The economic impacts affecting these sectors are described and quantified where possible (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; McIlgorm et al. 2011; Jang et al., 2014; Antonelis 2011). They also make attempts at aggregating economic impacts across sectors to provide regional cost estimates. Mouat et al. (2010) provide an estimate of marine litter costs for the Shetland (U.K.) economy, of â¬1â1.1 million on average per year, an estimate, which consists of actual expenditures and, in some cases, estimated lost income. This is only a single case study, and the sectors affected on Shetland would be affected to"

Ichthyoplankton cruises were conducted in continental shelf waters off west Louisiana from December 1981 through April 1982 to determine the distribution and abundance of larval drums and croakers (Cowan and Shaw 1988). The total sciaenid larval density was highest in April, and the high densities were associated with the coastal boundary layer, a horizontal density front caused by an intrusion of freshwater from the Atchafalaya River east of the study area. Sand seatrout larvae were the most abundant, followed by Atlantic croaker, spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), and banded drum (Larimus fasciatus). Spawning by sand seatrout began in January. Both sand seatrout and Atlantic croaker larvae were captured at higher rates at night than during the day (Cowan and Shaw 1988). Sand seatrout larvae appeared to be somewhat surface oriented, while spot may undergo a vertical migration. Sogard et al. (1987) collected ichthyoplankton at three inshoreâoffshore transects off Southwest Pass, Louisiana, Cape Sand Blas, Florida, and Galveston, Texas, from 1979 through 1981 to determine densities of larval Gulf menhaden, Atlantic croaker, and spot in the northern Gulf of Mexico. All species were more abundant at inshore than offshore stations. Gulf menhaden and Atlantic croaker were most abundant off Southwest Pass, Louisiana, a major outlet of the Mississippi River. Of the three species, only the Gulf menhaden demonstrated any consistent vertical distribution pattern. At inshore stations Gulf menhaden were concentrated near the surface at midday, while offshore and present at 70 m (229.7 ft), most were also caught near the surface (Sogard et al. 1987).

According to the UNâs own evaluation and despite considerable progress in some areas, high levels of hunger were still found in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, with moderate level of hunger persisting in Western, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, in Oceania, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and in Latin America and the Caribbean. The MDGs also sought to halve the proportion of the worldâs population without improved drinking water but, by 2015, âlow coverageâ was still recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, with only âmoderate coverageâ reported in the Caucasus and Central Asia.

246,43,0.326,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Likewise, rural abandonment makes the land suitable for a comeback of large mammals (Supplementary Table 1.C). Large grazers are benefiting from the lower hunting pressures that usually accompany abandonment (Breitenmoser 1998; GortÃ¡zar et al. 2000). European carnivore species have been increasing since the 1960s in abundance and distribution, as stable populations of Eastern Europe are naturally recolonizing abandoned landscapes of Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, and the Alps (Enserink and Vogel 2006; Boitani 2000; Stoate et al. 2009). It is also important to consider the trophic interactions between species and the cascading effects driven by rewilding. For example, amphibians and otter ( Lutra lutra) populations are known to benefit from the restoration of ditches by beavers ( Castor fiber) in abandoned areas of Eastern Europe (Kull et al. 2004). The presence of lynx in some parts of Switzerland reduced the roe deer and chamois browsing impact by regulating both populations (Breitenmoser 1998)."
73,768,0.326,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Economic growth is considered to be essential to modern societies. Its imperatives permeate political debate, economic development, public and social media, and commerce. Greater wealth drives more resource consumption. This is reï¬ected in the demand for technology, urban water, meat, or exotic plant-based food, all of which have a substantial footprint (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2014), along with food waste and or the expansion of urban areas. Whilst it is argued that with dematerialisation of the economy less natural resources can create greater wealth, the degree to which this is possible is uncertain (Weizsacker et al. 1998). The natural resource governance system drives resource consumption more effectively than it supports conservation and restoration. Nowhere is this more obvious than with the conversion of farmland and undeveloped green spaces into peri-urban uses. Harmful invasive species include plants (âweedsâ), animals, insects, diseases and other living beings that harm human and ecological interests. They invade ecosystem types from oceans to mountains (Global Invasive Species Database, http:// issg.org/database/species/search.asp). Weeds invade domestic gardens and farmlands, and can trigger dangerous allergies. Rodents destroy standing or stored produce, contaminate products or spread disease; wild dogs, feral pigs and other pest animals spread human or animal diseases; marine invasive species contaminate water and damage ï¬sheries; mosquitos spread serious disease â the list of economic, social and environmental impacts of invasive species is daunting. Particularly in urban and peri-urban environments the role of pest animals as vectors of disease adds a health risk to this problem. Adding biodiversity loss caused by pest species to this list, and the problem of harmful invasive species in peri-urban areas comes into focus as signiï¬cant in many parts of the world. Australia reports 166 agricultural invasive species from a total of 409 invasive species. For urban invasive pests, Australia reports 154 with many of these occurring in urban, rural and peri-urban settings. Riverine and marine invasive species also impact on urban interests, such as water quality, marine foods and recreational use. Insects impact upon lifestyle and spread disease. Invasive vertebrate pests, particularly foxes, wild dogs, feral cats, rabbits and feral pigs cause much economic damage. Feral pigs cause losses to sugar cane and bananas in north Queensland while rabbits ring-bark trees and shrubs and prevent regeneration, contributing to poor land condition. These invasive vertebrates collectively generate an agricultural cost exceeding $A1b per year: Rabbits cost $206 million per year, wild dogs, $48.5 million per year, foxes, $21.2 million per year, and feral pigs, $100 million per year (Gong et al. 2008). Invasive animals also have a substantial ecological impact (Roberts et al. 2013). In New South Wales they are implicated in 40 % of the threatened biodiversity, threatening 388 native species that constitute 83 % of endangered animal populations and 38 % of endangered ecological communities. Rabbits impact 156 threatened species, wild dogs and foxes impact 76 threatened species and feral pigs more than 20 threatened species. Feral pigs prey on as much as 70 % of sea turtle nests in north Queensland, foxes are signiï¬cant predators of a wide range of native fauna"

All of these types can be found in Florida, and each is characterized by certain tidal characteristics, hydroperiod, and forest structure. Riverine forests, which occur along tidal rivers and creeks with high input of freshwater, sediment, and nutrients, exhibit the highest productivity of all six types (see below). The high productivity and dynamic hydrology lead to high rates of organic matter export. Forest stands found along portions of the Shark River in Florida fall into the riverine category. The fringe forest type develops along the seaward edge of protected shorelines, has an open exchange with the sea and is well flushed by the tides. Fringe forests experience sea-strength salinity and receive fewer nutrients than riverine forests. Consequently, their productivity is somewhat lower. Overwash islands, which are sometimes considered to be a special case of fringe forest, experience higher tidal velocities that âoverwashâ the island and flush out accumulated litter. The overwash island type is found throughout the Ten Thousand Island region of Florida. Basin mangrove forests develop in topographic depressions, typically inland of fringing or riverine forests. Water movement is less, with tidal inundation occurring seasonally or with spring or storm tides. Once inundated by tides or freshwater, basin forests"
365,684,0.326,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Interventions that target improved feed resources can result in faster animal growth rates, higher milk production, earlier age at first calving, and increased incomes. Better nutrition can also increase fertility rates and reduce mortality rates of calves and mature animals, thus improving animal and herd performance and system resilience to climatic shocks. For cattle, such interventions may include the use of improved pasture and agroforestry species and the use of nutritious diet supplements. Feed availability for ruminants can be a major constraint in the mixed systems of the tropics during the dry season. The options available to smallholders include higherdigestibility crop residues, diet supplementation with grain, small areas of planted legumes (âfodder banksâ), the leaves of certain agroforestry species, and grass species that can be planted on field boundaries or in rehabilitated gullies (with added erosion control benefits). These kinds of supplements can substantially increase productivity per animal while also increasing resilience by making substantial impacts on income. For example, the feeding of 1 kg of Leucaena leucocephala leaves per animal per day can nearly triple milk yields and live-weight gains (Thornton and Herrero 2010). At the same time, because these supplements improve the diet of ruminant livestock, the amount of methane produced by the animal per kilogram of meat and milk produced is substantially reduced (Bryan et al. 2013). There may also be soil carbon sequestration benefits from planting trees and deep-rooted pasture species. For example, planting Leucaena trees on farms increases carbon sequestration in the soil, possibly by up to 38 tonnes of carbon per ha (Albrecht and Kandji 2003). In many regions, crop residues (stover) are a critical feed resource; increases in stover digestibility of 10 percentage points are well within the range of variation in digestibility that has been observed in sorghum, for example (BlÃ¼mmel and Reddy 2006). Such genetically improved dual-purpose crops (food and feed), both cereals and legumes, are widely grown in some parts of the tropics. Improving the diets of ruminants is one of the most direct and effective ways of increasing productivity and incomes, while mitigating GHGs at the same time. Mixed crop-livestock system diets are often complex and amenable to modification. Widespread application of the different options above is plausible in many situations. Adoption rates of up to 43% for genetically improved dual-purpose crops have been observed in some parts of West Africa, though lower adoption rates are more usual (Kristjanson et al. 2002). There may be constraints at the local level, however: diet intensification may require additional household labour, and the availability of appropriate planting material may be inadequate, for example. In addition, some of these alternatives require appropriate technical capacity to manage them as well as some cash investment. Some also require land, although sometimes competition for land can be avoided: in an example from Ethiopia, degraded land is given to female headed households or landless youth, who thus get a chance to produce small stock for sale. Overall, the above constraints may not pose insuperable barriers to the continuing uptake of climate-smarter feeding practices in the future."

169,853,0.325,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"As described by a number of river concepts (see above), essential elements of riverine ecosystems are river morphology hydrology, sediment, continuity, water quality, and biota. Understanding the interrelation between abiotic system elements and biota and food webs is vital for assessing human impacts and developing effective restoration and mitigation strategies. Although treated in separate chapters in this book for practical purposes (see Chaps. 2â13), it is evident that the linkages among system elements are as important as processes within each system element. It is likely that while human stressors may alter each system element individually, interactions among stressors strongly affect overall system behavior and response (Fig. 29.3). Finally, managers are facing a very complex system of natural and humaninduced processes making it impossible to ï¬nd simple solutions for restoring degraded rivers.

However, historically the lower saltmarsh has been favoured for its proximity to the feeding grounds and for its low vegetation, aiding predator detection. Van de Pol et al. (2010) concluded that it is more difï¬cult for birds to infer that habitat quality has decreased from changes in the frequency of rare and unpredictable extreme events than from trends in climatic means. The result is, at present, that the lower parts of the saltmarsh may function as an ecological trap."

302,386,0.325,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"to which a problem or a risk can be structured depends on consensus, values, views, and secured evidence, which includes knowledge of causes and effects. The continuum ranges from structured problems with common values and consensus on strategies and on the evidence, which comprises secured knowledge including clear causes and effects, to unstructured problems with competing values and no consensus on strategies and on the scientific evidence due to ambiguity and uncertainty [58]. In the case of the adoption of the Microbead-Free Waters Act, different actors were involved in âstructuring the problemâ [58]. Scientific evidence on the pathways into and the abundance in the environment was provided in strong collaboration with activists. For example, the NGO 5 Gyres Institute published the first microplastic pollution survey of the Great Lakes region in collaboration with the State University of New York in 2013. The concentration of microplastics found in the Great Lakes was higher than that of most samples collected in the oceans [59]. The studies were covered by the media, and the argumentation chain presented was quite clear: the microbeads threaten our lakes and rivers, stem from our cosmetic products, and slip through the sewage plants [60â62]. A clear scientific narrative was established and presented by scientists and activists to big personal care companies. The short âviewpointâ paper by Rochman et al. titled âScientific Evidence Supports a Ban on Microbeadsâ [63], comprising a simple calculation of the number of microbeads and their route into the environment, was clearly aimed at strengthening this scientific narrative. At the same time, environmental and ocean-protection NGOs campaigned for a ban on microplastics in cosmetics. Their campaigning methods included shopping guides that listed all producers using microplastics in their products and the app âBeat the Microbeadâ which could be used to check whether a product contains plastics. This app was launched by two Dutch NGOs in 2012 and further developed for international use by UNEP and another environmental NGO in 2013 [64]. With the guide and the app, tools were provided which enabled consumers to reduce their use of cosmetic products containing microplastics and to become more aware of the issue. In the cosmetics industry, the evidence presented by the coalition between scientists and activists was not seriously contested. Global players like Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, and other multinationals announced that their products would be plastic-free within the next few years and that they would use natural substitutes instead. Since then, many more companies have pledged to phase out microplastics, motivated by reputational or environmental concerns. With the detection of high amounts of microplastics in the Great Lakes, on the doorstep of the USA, the campaign against microplastics was boosted and entered the governmental arena, with several US states passing laws banning microbeads in cosmetics in 2014 and 2015 (e.g., New York, Illinois, California). In March 2015, legislation to ban microplastics in cosmetics was introduced in the US Congress. How well the problem was structured by then is reflected in the speed with which the bill was passed: In March, it was introduced in the House of Representatives; in December, it was reported on and amended by the Committee"

73,149,0.324,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Nutrients When added to an aquatic environment can quickly cause excessive algae growth consuming available (dissolved) oxygen previously available for other aquatic ï¬ora and fauna. Then as algae die, decomposition further reduces available oxygen, which can only be replenished by a signiï¬cant change to the water body, such as aeration or a complete water change. Isolated water bodies can suffer longterm loss of bio-diversity if the condition is allowed to continue. This is known as eutrophication and is harmful to ï¬sh and other aquatic organisms. Certain strains of algae are sufï¬ciently toxic to be harmful to livestock and humans. Oil and Grease These in stormwater introduce toxicants and coat plants and the gills of ï¬sh with a ï¬lm preventing the exchange of oxygen and nutrients. Some of these compounds are dangerous even at low concentrations, include Chlorobenzenes and Surfactants, which as a generic group, impact on the health and population of benthic organisms. Heavy Metals These are transported by urban run-off mostly bonded to particles as noted earlier. These are of concern due to their potential toxicity and ability to bio-accumulate. There is also growing evidence that these heavy metals are ï¬nding their way into the food chain, with many harbour based ï¬sheries being closed. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations have noted in part that many harbours world wide are adversely impacted by the heavy metals (Sciorintino and Ravikumar 1999). Chlorine, Acid Wash and Erosion from the maintenance of pools, spas, and fountains can pose a major risk to stormwater through erosion, increase in sediments and the addition of pollutants such as chlorine and acid wash. Bacteria and viruses are pathogens present in faecal matter which can be present in stormwater runoff as pet and wildlife waste, leaky septic systems, runoff from agriculture, broken sanitary sewers, and cross connections.

On the other hand, other regions will continue the intensive occupation and use of land, which may impose potentially greater impacts on natural systems (e.g., agricultural intensification, growth of urban areas) (Deinet et al. 2013). In this chapter, our goal is to explore, on the basis of existing information, how top scavengers fit into a wilder Europe. To do this, we first examine the role of availability of carrion resources in the maintenance of ecosystem functioning. Then, we examine the implications of the creation of supplementary feeding stations (socalled vulture restaurants). In addition, we will describe how the relationship between humans and vultures has evolved, identifying ecosystem services provided by these charismatic species from the past to the current date. Finally, we propose that the conservation of top scavenger species and the maintenance of natural complex ecological process linked to the exploitation of unpredictable carrion resources in rewilding the European landscapes should rely on favouring wild ungulates expansion, the recovery of predator populations and the promotion of traditional extensive grazing practices."

291,127,0.324,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The goal of this monograph was to show a variety of possibilities to visualize mortality dynamics on the Lexis plane. While we provided examples of raw and smoothed mortality surfaces, our focus was on visualizing rates of mortality improvement (âROMIsâ), i.e., the derivative of age-specific death rates with respect to time. We provided ROMI examples for national populations covered by the Human Mortality Database as well as for selected causes of death in the United States. These âROMI-plotsâ were quite instructive to detect period and cohort effects. We also illustrated how changes in age-specific mortality contribute to a gain (or loss) in life expectancy. In Chap. 9 we decomposed seasonal data for causes of death to investigate whether the seasonal pattern, measured via the amplitude and the peak moment (âphaseâ), has changed over or age. The previous chapter dealt with survival chances of persons who were diagnosed with cancer. Despite the large number of figures, our list is obviously not exhaustive; here we want to provide a few more two ideas how the Lexis diagram can be used to illustrate not only mortality dynamics. Figure 11.1 adapts our ROMI approach to fertility. The top panel contains a surface map of age-specific fertility rates in the eastern part of Germany. Birth counts and corresponding exposures by single year of age and calendar time were downloaded from the Human Fertility Database (2017). The estimates were (again) generated with Camardaâs R package for smoothing surfaces with P-splines"
230,143,0.324,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"concluded, that pursuit-diving birds have the highest frequency of plastic uptake, followed by surface-seizing and dipping seabirds. Provencher et al. (2010) reported that marine birds, feeding on crustaceans and cephalopods had ingested more plastic than piscivorous seabirds, and those omnivores are most likely to confuse prey and plastic. Seabirds with specialized diets are less likely to misidentify plastic, unless a particular type resembles their prey (Ryan 1987). Many gull species frequent rubbish bins and landfill areas, in addition to foraging in marine habitats and seem prone to ingest debris. However, ingested debris does not often show up in their stomachs during dissections because they clear them daily by regurgitating hard prey remains (Hays and Cormons 1974; Ryan and Fraser 1988; Lindborg et al. 2012). As regurgitation takes place regularly, plastics quantified from boluses reflect the ingestion of the very last period, rather than accumulated debris (Camphuysen et al. 2008; Ceccarelli 2009; Codina-GarcÃ­a et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2013). Tubenosed seabirds mostly retain plastic and hard prey items (Mallory 2006) because they possess two stomachs with a constriction (Isthmus gastris) between the glandular proventriculus and the muscular gizzard (Furness 1985; Ryan and Jackson 1986). Even when spitting stomach oil to defend themselves or when feeding their chicks, only plastics from the proventriculus are regurgitated but items from the gizzard are retained (Rothstein 1973). Marine turtles frequently ingest plastic bags as they may mistake them for jellyfish, a common component of their diet (Carr 1987; Lutz 1990; Mrosovsky et al. 2009; Tourinho et al. 2010; Townsend 2011; Campani et al. 2013; Schuyler et al. 2014). While accidental plastic ingestion by filter-feeding baleen whales (Mysticeti) might be assumed to be common, Walker and Coe (1990) expected that toothed whales (Odontoceti) would have a low rate of plastic ingestion because they use echolocation or visual cues to locate their prey. However, Laist (1997), Simmonds (2012) and Baulch and Perry (2014) all made extensive descriptions of toothed whales that had ingested plastic. Indeed, our updated literature search showed that 54 and 62 % of the baleen and toothed whales, respectively, ingest plastics. It has also been suggested, that marine mammals could see plastic as a curiosity and while investigating it, they swallow it or become entrapped (Mattlin and Cawthorn 1986; Laist 1987). Large predatory fishes and birds are known to frequently inspect plastic debris and take bites out of larger plastic items. CadÃ©e (2002) observed that 80 % of foamed plastic debris on the Dutch coast showed peckmarks of birds and suggested that the birds mistake polystyrene foam for cuttlebones or other food. Carson et al. (2013) observed bite marks of sharks or large predatory fishes on 16 % of plastic debris beached on Hawaii indicating âtestingâ of materials. Choy and Drazen (2013) showed that among 595 individuals of seven such large predatory fish species, 19 % of individuals (range per species <1â58 %) had actually ingested plastic. Foraging strategies may vary under different conditions of food availability. Duguy et al. (2000) considered that decreased availability of jellyfish during winter could be the reason for the higher incidence of plastic bags during these months in the diet of turtles. In conclusion it seems that although indiscriminate omnivorous predators or filter feeders appear most prone to plastic ingestion, there are many examples of"

182,12,0.324,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Expanding beyond much-studied laboratory contexts to explore the medical history of animals in zoos, on farms, in hospitals, post-mortem rooms and international policy arenas, it illuminates the diverse species that have participated in medicine, the many roles they have played in it, and how their bodies and habits have both shaped and been shaped by its ideas, practices and institutions. Crucially, the volume highlights how these diverse species forged multispecies networks, thereby extending animal historyâs typical focus on the dyadic relationships between humans and another species of animal. The third objective of this volume is to speak to the twenty-first-century initiative known as One Health (OH). featuring prominently in medical, veterinary and scientific publications, and in national and international health policy and position statements, OH pursues an expansive vision of improving health and wellbeing through the multidisciplinary study of problems at the interface of humans, animals and their environments. for its proponents, OH represents a necessary response to a host of shared threats to human and animal health, such as emerging diseases that transmit between animals and humans, antimicrobial resistance, food insecurity, food safety and climate change. They argue that such issues cannot be tackled effectively within the traditional disciplinary compartments of human medicine, veterinary medicine and the life sciences. Rather, integrated, coordinated approaches are required, in which the health of animals is considered in relation to the health of humans and the environment.6 This volume situates OH within a longer historical context by illuminating certain precedents to this way of working. It also offers a critical, empirically grounded perspective on its operation today by exploring the circumstances that gave rise to its emergence as a self-conscious movement, and how its proponents conceptualize the roles of animals within it. In addressing these three objectives, the volume also addresses three distinct audiences: historians of animals, historians of science and medicine, and health professionals concerned with OH today. The remainder of this chapter introduces the history of animals as a field of enquiry, and situates this study in relation to it. While historians of animals will be familiar with its discussion of the methodological and conceptual issues"

97,533,0.323,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","With regard to disaster risk reduction, Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson also highlight the need for a long-term resilience thinking to tackle impacts from climate change and urbanisation. Reviewing the potentials but also the limitations of green and grey infrastructure for disaster risk reduction in urban areas, they suggest that intermediate âhybridâ approaches, combining both green and grey approaches, may be the most effective strategy for reducing risk from environmental hazards. This is especially the case when NBS approaches may be insufficient to meet the rising impacts of climate change, in case of space limitation or when resource limitations require cost effectiveness in the context of both climatic and economic uncertainty. A particular part of green infrastructure in cities â riparian forests and wetlands â are highlighted as NBS with particular benefits for dense urban areas. Dagmar Haase introduces the management of these habitats as a NBS with multiple benefits that include risk mitigation and adaptation concerning both climate extremes as well as enhanced flood and drought probabilities, while providing co-benefits such as a buffer against high air temperatures, water availability during heatwaves and recreation potential. The author presents several options that show wetland and riparian forestsâ functionality as NBS to better face the consequences of climate change in cities and urban regions and stresses that urban riparian forest and wetlands need to not only be conserved but also be restored in case of degradation. In line with the previous authors, Dagmar Haase also promotes a hybrid approach of combining natural remnants of wetlands and floodplain forests with technical solutions. To realise âmini-wetlandsâ and âriparian trenchesâ in areas disconnected from the river may also create new jobs. Following also suggestions by Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson, the complementarity of both NBS and technology may be a clever, pragmatic and at the same time innovative solution to complex socio-ecological problems. In addition, potential disservices from urban riparian forests and wetlands, including vector-borne diseases, e.g. transported via mosquitoes, may need to be considered as well with potential negative effects to human health. Careful consideration including such trade-offs can lead to more informed decision-making. Complementing the contributions by Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson as well as Dagmar Haase, in their chapter McKenna Davis and Sandra Naumann also focus on disaster risk reduction and introduce sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) as a NBS to flood risk management. Based on their case study analysis, including cost-benefit calculations in comparison with conventional piped drainage systems, the authors conclude that SUDS have a high potential as sustainable, costeffective approaches, which can complement pure âgreyâ infrastructure and can be applied within new developments or used to retrofit existing systems. Nevertheless, uncertainties about long-term maintenance, performance and cost (-effectiveness) are main barriers that limit the implementation of SUDS. Authors highlight that making lessons learned and data gathered from existing projects more widely available will support a larger uptake. Maybe most important to support the uptake of SUDS is the fact that NBS such as SUDS can provide multifunctionality, while purely grey and engineered solutions cannot."

36,522,0.322,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.7 Recommendations for Conservation of Hunted Bats 12.7.1 More Research is Needed to Understand Hunting Impacts One of the major challenges to bat conservation is lack of knowledge of how hunting affects bats, their population size, and distribution. Collecting these data requires trained biologists, sociologists, statisticians, and well-planned survey techniques and questionnaires that can address sensitive questions. For many regions and species, there is little or no population information on bats, so that population trends are unknown. Managers are therefore encouraged to start monitoring programs by which hunting impacts on population size can be tracked over time. Some bat conservation initiatives provide useful models for population size assessment and monitoring (e.g. Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Research Unit, Filipinos for Flying Foxes, WCS Malaysia, United States Department of Defense in the Mariana Islands, FFI Cambodia). Using the population size estimation and monitoring described, more studies are also needed that investigate the direct and indirect impacts of hunting on bat populations. For example, long term monitoring projects of both people and bats, could show trends in the correlations between number of hunted bats and bat population responses. Finally, more needs to be learned about the people hunting bats and the conditions that lead to increased hunting (Cawthorn and Hoff 2015). If it is understood why people hunt (e.g. for protein? for livelihoods? to vary their diet? for"

389,346,0.322,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) is a herbivorous fish that is distributed throughout the Japanese Archipelago (Iguchi et al. 1999) (Fig. 17.1). The species exhibits an amphidromous and annual life cycle. After the winter juvenile stage in the sea, young ayu migrate into rivers and graze on benthic microalgae attached to the riverbed (Iguchi and Hino 1996). Ayu are also an important resource for humans and for avian species, such as the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo (Takahashi et al. 2006); therefore, the radionuclide contamination of ayu may have a significant effect on both humans and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In Fukushima Prefecture, Iguchi et al. (2013) reported high levels of radionuclide contamination in the riverbed sediments. Ayu ingest silt while grazing on benthic microalgae, exposing themselves to the radiation from the contaminated sediments, including the silt component."

For example, rotenone in aqueous solution, as it is commonly used in marine sampling programs in coral reef and mangrove habitats, is strongly selective in affecting fishes, but has little or no effect on most natant decapod crustaceans or other types of nekton (Robertson and Smith-Vaniz 2008). Consequently, nekton-sampling programs relying on rotenone are biased toward fishes, even if they may not be the most abundant nektonic organisms in the assemblage. Table 6.17 compares the nekton assemblage from a mangrove habitat in Florida Bay using a combination of nets and rotenone poisoning with results from visual censusing and video recording. Only half of the top ten most abundant fish families appear in all three lists, and these were represented by species considered as resident nekton (families Gerridae, Cyprinodontidae, Fundulidae, Poecilidae, and Gobidae). However, there are also some striking differences in the importance of dominant groups. Engraulids (anchovies) were the top-ranked family captured in nets but accounted for only 1.4 % of fishes in the video recording and do not even rank in the top ten families in the visual census. Also, in the visual census, the atherinids (silversides) comprised nearly 84 % of the fishes, but were not detected in the video recording data. Species diversity and evenness were greater in the net sample than in either the visual census or the video recording collections. For example, only two families represented by six species accounted for nearly 88 % of all nekton in the visual census, but five families and 15 species were required to account for a similar percentage of nekton in the net samples. The video recording samples were intermediate in this regard, requiring seven families and 11 species to account for 88 % of the individuals. The video data also included a high percentage (9.6 %) of juvenile individuals that could not be identified to either species or family. The three methods clearly paint a very different picture of the nekton assemblage in this single mangrove system. The enclosure nets with rotenone likely represented the species found among the mangrove prop roots while the visual census may have better represented the nekton assemblage immediately adjacent to the mangrove forest per se. There is considerable debate over the relative contribution of mangrove habitat in supporting estuarine nekton assemblages. While some studies have suggested a positive relationship between the areal extent of fringing mangrove forests and regional fisheries production (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008), others have questioned the importance of mangroves as nursery habitat for nekton (Sheridan and Hays 2003; Faunce and Serafy 2006). Unlike other coastal wetland habitats in which production by the dominant plant species tends to support a trophic structure on which nekton assemblages derive considerable nutrition, mangroves generally do not directly contribute much trophic support for nekton (Stoner and Zimmerman 1988; Sheridan and Hays 2003). Alternative sources of trophic support from nearby habitats such as seagrasses may contribute more to the diets of nekton found in mangroves (Nagelkerken and van der Velde 2004). Nonetheless, mangrove habitats seem to provide at least some nursery functions for both recreationally and commercially important fishery organisms and their food resources (Odum et al. 1982)."

302,202,0.322,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The role of the general public through awareness and active involvement (i.e., citizen science) is discussed in detail elsewhere in this book, both with an historical overview and specifics related to MP pollution (see Syberg et al. this volume [62]). Briefly it could be suggested that in comparison to other environmental issues, the public has been invaluable in assessing the magnitude of plastics and MP pollution through volunteer beach cleanups and surveys that provide data for monitoring programmers, as well as carrying out the practical task of removing beach litter. In the USA most information regarding the abundance and distribution of beach debris has been derived from volunteer beach cleaning efforts [63], and such public involvement is also occurring elsewhere. Public collaboration with scientific research has taken place in a number of locations worldwide, for instance, the collection of marine litter in the Firth of Forth, Scotland [64], collection of beach debris along the coast of southeast Chile [65], and many volunteers mobilized for beach surveys in South Africa [66]. However, to the best of our knowledge, such public-involving initiatives have not been attempted in areas surrounding African freshwaters. Part of this problem may be, as has been discussed, a scarcity of information regarding the scale of potential MP pollution, which results in a lack of funding and a lack of awareness. As discussed, funding for environmental issues may not be the highest priority in most African countries, but NGOs which could collaboratively work with various public sectors have paid little or no attention in raising public awareness in the issue of plastic waste management [67]. Similarly, the opportunities for 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) are not well explored and advocated in developing countries [68]. It has been suggested that improved education on the issues of waste management in developing countries, and the preparation and training of environmental professionals and technicians, could be the way forward. Some developing countries have reported positive effects from investing in education, such as citizens assuming responsibility and higher status of waste workers, which have resulted in cleaner cities [68]. Such programs would potentially have similar results in urbanized regions around African freshwaters, and the downstream effect of cleaner cities would be less urban waste from which to produce MPs. But as mentioned earlier in this section, the increase of awareness and education of the population must be coupled with an increase in effective waste management and ultimately coherent regional political action."

The role of the Dutch Wadden Sea as a nursery area seems to have changed considerably, a pattern which is most prominent in plaice but also apparent in some other flatï¬sh species. The densities of 0-year old plaice have strongly reduced since the mid-1980s to a stable and low level that has not changed since 2000. The period in which they use the area has also changed: instead of staying from early spring until October, they now tend to disappear in July/August. The 1- and 2-year olds have disappeared completely since the end of the 20th century. Although several mechanisms may be operating, climate change is a likely cause of these alterations. Using dynamic energy budgets, Teal et al. (2012) showed that the most likely explanation for the recent loss of the nursery function, especially for plaice, is that increased temperatures make coastal areas unsuitable for growth. Growth rate data for 0-year old plaice showed that recent higher summer temperatures result in metabolic activity raised to levels at which food becomes limiting (Teal et al. 2008). In contrast to the decline observed in overall biomass, dominated by marine juveniles, the resident species show an increase followed by a stable period in the coastal area. However, understanding of the mechanisms acting on the different resident species is still very limited. One exception is the discovery that the decline observed in eelpout Zoarces vivparus in the Wadden Sea since 1985 is due to an increase in temperature above the thermal maximum of the species, causing thermally limited oxygen delivery (PÃ¶rtner and Knust 2007). Thus, the mechanisms underlying the large changes observed in the ï¬sh fauna of the Wadden Sea are still largely unknown. They are certainly partly climate related, but the impacts of changes in food, predators and abiotic factors acting on the different life stages are still poorly understood (Rijnsdorp et al. 2009)."
218,89,0.322,Sustainable Development in The Jordan Valley : Final Report of The Regional Ngo Master Plan,"factor for enabling macro-invertebrates. Less water in the LJR caused changes to the stream channel, resulting in a narrower and more canalized river ecosystem. Less water has also resulted in much slower velocities, reducing the number of habitats dependent on high flows, such as falls, cascades and rapids. Less water in the river also means less dilution of inflowing polluted water, such as brackish (ground) water or wastewater. This leads to higher pollution concentrations in the river stream. As a result, the ecology of the river is now reduced to pockets of high resistant and medium-to-slow velocity habitats. Reduction in water flows, and damming of the river and its tributaries resulted in smaller river sediment loads. Slower velocities carry far less sediment with smaller grain sizes. The formation of streamside water bodies, such as deserted meanders, stopped, and related habitats disappeared from the riverâs ecosystem, resulting in the loss of unique community compositions of both plant and animal species speciï¬cally adapted to these habitats. If healthy freshwater ecosystems are to be restored, it is important to address the natural flows around which flora and fauna can develop. Critical parameters in this respect are the quality of"

Without radio-tracking on fields between-time steps variability in data, however, it was not possible to quantify between-individual and between-time steps variability proportion of time birds forage on for any of the focal species. Given the state of knowledge for between-individuals variability, treated fields. Also assumed that the uncertainty was maximized by parameterizing the within-field PT distributions to range from 0 to 1, proportion of time birds spend on with the best estimate being the randomly chosen most likely PT from the between-fields distribution. treated fields equates to the proportion No variation was assumed between time steps, a reasonable assumption for nesting birds, but not of their diet that comes from treated pre-migratory or migratory birds. No data exist to determine whether proportion of time birds spend on fields. treated fields equates to the proportion of their diet that comes from treated fields. The various shortcomings with the PT variable could ultimately lead to under- or over-estimation of risk. The results of the evaluation of model performance and the flowable CPY field studies suggest that the risk estimates produced by LiquidPARAM are reasonable or over-estimated.

231,171,0.321,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Annual production of secondary producers (formation of heterotrophic biomass) is estimated at 2â20 g C mâ2, with higher production in the northern North Sea than the Southern Bight (Fransz et al. 1991). This gradient may be because large amounts of primary production in the shallow southern areas are transferred to benthic communities and so are unavailable for consumption by zooplankton. De Wilde et al. (1992) reported a signiï¬cant decline in zooplankton abundance across the North Sea between 1960 and 1980. As shown in Fig. 1.36 this decline was followed by a subsequent recovery and then a new and ongoing decline. The long-term trend in zooplankton biomass for the North Sea as a whole is well documented through the variability observed in its sub-areas. Estimates of annual secondary and higher production for the North Sea are given in Table 1.5. The benthic fauna production estimate for Oyster Ground (36 g C mâ2 yearâ1) includes 21 g C mâ2 yearâ1 for macrofauna and 6 g C mâ2 yearâ1 for meiofauna (De Wilde et al. 1984). Biomass of brown and green algae increased in the Wadden Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat area between 1960 and 1990 (Beukema 1989; Josefson et al. 1993). KrÃ¶ncke and Knust (1995) found a decrease in total benthic biomass at the Dogger Bank between 1950 and the 1980s."

Commonly associated risk factors include smoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, and low physical activity. Tobacco smoking alone produces 12 % of the global disease burden in the European Region (ranges from 3 to 27 % for the individual countries) and it causes 2â21 % of all deaths. For Bulgaria, these rates are 13.5 % and 12.4 %, respectively (Vassilevsky et al. 2009). Annually, more than four billion people die worldwide from diseases related to tobacco products. By 2030, this number is expected to reach ten million, which will turn tobacco smoking into the biggest single cause of death (World Bank 1999).

Among several important publications, Thompson et al. [26] published a famous paper in science entitled âLost at sea: Where is all the plastic?â which is being recognized as a major driver for the elevated scientific interest [17]. The significant increase in scientific publications on the topic was followed with increased international media attention and political measures being enforced. Reports about the plastic pollution problem have thus been broadcasted in international media such as Reuters [27], and political measures have been taken in different regions of the world.

StÃ©phenne and Lambin (2001) also show that feed requirement per TLU in the Sahelian region is 4.6 tons of dry matter (DM) per year. This translates to a carrying capacity of 7.25 ha per TLU. Based on this, we overlaid the grazing biomass productivity and livestock density and determined that more than 75 % of the grazing lands are experiencing overgrazing. This partly explains the low livestock productivity in the countryâan aspect that leads to high cost of land degradation. Only about 4 % of the households with livestock practice improved pasture management (Table 17.8). The improved pasture management include different forms of rotational grazing and restricted movement of livestock. Based on EPIC simulation discussed earlier, the cost of land degradation due to loss of milk and beef offtake is US$152 million, which is about 2.2 % of the GDP. Loss of milk production accounts for 88 % of total on-farm loss. Loss of beef offtake is small due to the small offtake rate and the small gain in weight due to rotational grazing (Table 17.9)."

CGIAR itself has long recognized these weaknesses and embarked on a far-reaching reform process in 2010. The challenges of demonstrating wide-reaching impact through R4D are compounded by a rapidly growing human population, climate change and other complexities of our time. The human population has almost doubled from 3.8 billion in 1971 to 7.3 billion in 2014 (UN 2015b). With an expected extra two to three billion people to feed over the next 40 years, this will require targeted research efforts to achieve not just growing 70 % more food but making 70 % more food available on the plate to keep up with rapidly rising demand (WWAP 2012). Climate change is already affecting agriculture in many developing countries, and the effects will become increasingly challenging in the future. Higher temperatures, shifting disease and pest pressures, and more frequent and severe droughts and flooding will affect agricultural production and place increasing pressure on water and other natural resources (IPCC 2013). Climate change impacts are increasing the vulnerabilities of populations that are already struggling with food insecurity and poverty, even in the relatively conservative scenario of a global 2-degree temperature rise (Thornton et al. 2014a)."

These images can also tell us how OH advocates understand relationships between humans, animals and environmentsâas they are and how OH believes they should be. Humans appear regularly, talking to each other, caring for animals, working in laboratories, or as human hands. OH depicts itself as a form of care of animals, environments and the planet. Implicitly or explicitly, this imagery shares the assumption that humans must care via forms of custodianship where only human agency is made visible. In first world contexts we see familial or clinical scenes, most often with pets; in images of the global South and East we see small-scale, direct agricultural care and veterinary care of wildlife. In this way, OH indicates its globalizing ambition alongside its awareness of key differences in humanâanimal relationships in different parts of the world. Care and risk are held in balance, particularly in the context of zoonotic diseases, which by implication come from less appealing wildlife species and from modes of humanâanimal interactions that occur in traditional food and farming systems. This narrative casts animals and certain kinds of human as âguilty victimsâ, geographically far away from the global North, or socially excluded, who must be kept out at all costs.99 It is also at odds with emerging OH research which suggests that pandemic disease risks may be accentuated not by traditional but by modern intensive farming systems and the global distribution of their products.100 finally, it is worth observing that as time goes on, the imagery of OH has become more and more abstracted: following John Berger, the animals are literally disappearing from a movement primarily led by people concerned with animal health.101"

In Cuba and Chile, about 1 in 20 babies is born with low birth weight; in Colombia and Mexico, this proportion is about 1 in 10; and in Haiti, almost 1 in 4. For the region as a whole, 9 percent of babies are born with low birth weight, substantially below the level for countries in Africa (11â14 percent) and, especially, South Asia (28 percent). In some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the proportion of low birth weight babies has been increasing, especially among women with higher education levels. This result, which at first blush appears to be paradoxical, is a consequence of the fact that more premature babies who would have died in earlier years now survive (see Box 2.2 for evidence from Colombia).

Similarly, the three LC/EC50 values for aquatic mollusks ranged from 154 to >806 Î¼g CPY Lâ1, which also is consistent with general lack of sensitivity of this taxon to insecticides (Brock et al. 2000). Because of general lack of sensitivity, these taxa were not considered further in the ERA. Toxicity of CPY to benthos. There were few acute toxicity data for benthic organisms. Data from two species met the QC criteria (Table 3). LC50s for Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus were 399 and 377 Î¼g CPY kgâ1 (dwt), respectively, or expressed in terms of organic carbon content of the sediment 2,122 and 4,815 ng gâ1 organic carbon (OC), respectively. There were too few data to derive an SSD. Given that the concentration measured in the pore-water at the LC50 was close to the water-only LC50 (Ankley et al. 1994), it was previously concluded (Giesy et al. 1999) that the risk assessment for aquatic organisms could be applied to benthos on the basis of equilibrium partitioning and that risk of CPY to benthos could be extrapolated from organisms in the water column. Toxicity of CPYO. Insufficient toxicity data on the biologically active metabolite, CPYO, were available (Table 4) to construct an SSD. The LC50 values relevant to risks to surface-water organisms were a 48-h LC50 for D. magna of 1.9 Î¼g CPYO Lâ1 and 96-h LC50 of 1.1 Î¼g CPYO Lâ1 in the bluegill sunfish L. macrochirus. The only toxicity value reported for amphibians was in larval Rana boylii, but the reported LC50 value of >5 Î¼g CPYO Lâ1 was from a study that did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the ERA. The LC50 value for CPYO in D. magna was larger than CPY"
302,207,0.32,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The question then becomes, not if MPs are present, but where and how to sample them. The marine and estuarine research conducted in South Africa provides a potential guide via beach combing, water and sediment collection, and biological sampling. However, such efforts may be difficult in the absence of personnel, apparatus, and, of course, funding. Thus, the study of Biginagwa et al. [16], exemplified in Case Study II, in which MPs were extracted and identified from suitable biological indicators that inhabit the urbanized catchment area is offered as a model for research in other areas that can be conducted in a cost- and timeeffective manner. The confirmation of MPs is only the first step, albeit necessary for further understanding of sources and fate. Mitigating the effects of MPs requires the coming together of numerous interested stakeholders, not least the local populations. In the place where our species first evolved, it now falls on the current generation to preserve Africaâs freshwaters for the future."

151,345,0.32,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"There are a number of bird species that frequent agroecosystems besides those included as focal species in this assessment (see Best and Murray 2003). The USEPA (USEPA 2005) used estimates of mortality for the combination of focal species and bird sensitivities in each modeled exposure scenario to approximate the cumulative distribution of outcomes for the complex of species using treated fields. The approach assumes that the focal species included in the modeling exercise are representative of the birds and their exposures occurring in the fields (USEPA 2005). This assumption is supported by the selection of focal species known to occur on the treated crops by actual survey (e.g., Best and Murray 2003). According to the USEPA (2005), the outcomes of the three modeled sensitivity assumptions (low, median and high sensitivity) âcan be viewed as a stratified sample from the population which estimates the limits and mid points of the cumulative risk distribution and therefore provides a reasonable approximation of the distribution.â The resulting cumulative distribution of acute risk for banded application on corn at the maximum application rate of 1.12 kg haâ1 (1 lb ai Aâ1) is shown in Fig. 8. Results of simulations using LiquidPARAM indicate that several species of birds, if highly sensitive, would experience up to approximately 30% mortality. Similar results were predicted for alfalfa, almond, apple/cherry, grape, grapefruit and soybean (Table 5). For orange, somewhat greater risk is expected in the bird community because this crop has the greatest application rate allowed on the Lorsban Advanced label (i.e., 6.27 kg haâ1 (5.6 lb ai Aâ1)) (Fig. 9). Although the results of the LiquidPARAM modeling indicated some acute risk to the most sensitive species for several crops listed on the Lorsban Advanced label (Table 5), the evidence from field studies that used the corresponding application rates (i.e., corn, grapefruit, and orange) indicate that flowable CPY poses little risk to birds (Dittrich and Staedtler 2010; Frey et al. 1994; Gallagher et al. 1994; Selbach and Wilkens 2008b; Wolf et al. 2010). Thus, it would appear that LiquidPARAM"
347,100,0.319,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The starting point of giving good scientific advice to the policy sector is the data collection process. Good data collection depends on the robustness of data collection procedures. National Fisheries Institutes (NFIs) collect data through survey vessels with high costs attached to the process (Wilson 2009: 96). Besides fisheriesindependent data, fisheries-dependent data are also gathered, mainly through sampling of landings. Inconsistencies between data collection across countries result in controversies about data gathered. This has been especially true with regard to discards of fish in relation to stocks. The heterogeneity of national authorities responsible for enforcement and inspection, as well as different scientific methodologies in relation to calculating the length or ageing of landings, also complicates comparisons. As Wilson (2009) describes, data from fisheries is often not regarded as reliable and conflicts around data sources seen to be politically laden. An example of the problems with unreliability highlights this. In 2004 it was estimated that landings of cod were under-reported by 35 % (Wilson 2009: 99). However, scientists were heavily dependent on this data. Consequently, unreliable data have negative effects on ICESâ analyses later on in the process which could result in unreliable assessments of fish stocks and then possibly poorly formulated recommendations. The system of data gathering for fisheries has improved through means like video surveillance on trawlers and sophisticated enforcement procedures that help especially with discard data. This applies particularly in relation to the discard ban, which was first implemented in January 2015 in the Baltic Sea. The advice process has a very formalised procedure. First, the client asks for advice. Then expert groups (coordinated by ICES) have to collect data which is used to draft a technical scientific report. The draft report is then peer-reviewed by independent experts,9 and the review as well as the draft report is used by the advice drafting group to give advice. This final âICES adviceâ is then agreed upon in the Advisory Committee (ACOM)."

36,247,0.319,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"populations and provide a valuable ecosystem service for agricultural production. Until recently, surprisingly little work had quantified the impact of bat predation on insect biomass (Maas et al. 2015). Exclosure studies have long been a mainstay for studying the impacts of bird predation; however, it was widely assumed that such methods would not be suitable to measure the impact of bat insectivory, due to the misconception that all insect eating bats take highly mobile, flying prey. However, bats capable of gleaning insect prey from substrates exist throughout the world, and their impacts could be monitored via exclosure studies and disentangled from those of birds. This approach has been used fruitfully in the past five years, demonstrating significant increases in arthropod density when bats are absent, in agroecosystems (Williams-GuillÃ©n et al. 2008; Maas et al. 2013), reforestation (Morrison and Lindell 2012), and natural forests (Kalka et al. 2008). In Mexican polycultural shade coffee, arthropod densities on coffee plants during the rainy season nearly doubled in the absence of bats, with marked increases in densities of hoppers, katydids, cockroaches, and beetles (Williams-GuillÃ©n et al. 2008). However, no effects on plant damage were observed in that study, perhaps as a result of the short duration of the study or release of spiders and other arthropod predators. In Indonesian shade cacao, excluding bats resulted in a 29 % increase in arthropod numbers (Maas et al. 2013). Although herbivory did not differ significantly between cacao plantations with different levels of shade or proximities to primary habitats within the landscape, exclosure of bats resulted in a significant decrease in yields, with the effects of bird and bat predation together valued at an astonishing US $730 per ha and year (bat predation was valued at US $520 per ha and year). However, the effects of bat predation on crop pests are not universal: An exclosure study in Costa Rican coffee found that excluding bats alone had virtually no effect on the density or damage caused to beans by the devastating coffee berry borer (Karp et al. 2013). Exclosure studies are not suitable to measure the impact of high-flying insectivores, such as molossids. However, careful extrapolations taking into account bat feeding rates, population sizes, pest reproduction, and survivorship, and the costs of inputs allow for estimation of the economic impact of predation for other bats, particularly molossids forming large colonies. Cleveland et al. (2006) estimate that Mexican free-tailed bats (T. brasiliensis) feeding on the cotton bollworm moth in Texas provide pest limitation services worth roughly US $183 per ha and year to cotton growers. Extending these estimates to agricultural areas throughout the USA suggests that bat predation could have a value of nearly US $23 billion annually (Boyles et al. 2011). These benefits hold for both conventional and transgenic cotton (Federico et al. 2008), although the introduction of Bt cotton (a genetically modified organism whose tissues produce an insecticide derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis), coupled with reduced area in cotton cultivation, has led to a decline in the overall value of this pest limitation service (Lopez-Hoffman et al. 2014)."

IAEA, 2005). In addition, in the report of Cardis in 2006, it is said that the number of deaths is expected to be 16,000 people (CRIEPI, health effects of Chernobyl Research Center for Radiation Safety Accident http://criepi.denken. or.jp/jp/ldrc/study/topics/20060904.html). The Fukushima nuclear accident was evaluated to be INES level 7. Therefore, calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective dose is unavoidable. If someone calculates the number of deaths based on radiation by this accident as a few hundred people, how is this to be explained to the public, especially the people of Fukushima? At this time, we have no answer to the question: âHow do I know if my child will be one of the few hundred victims?â. Nowadays, we cannot identify whether this cancer is due to radiation. In the future, some cancer patients will likely go to court about the Fukushima nuclear accident. If the court decides to accept a causal connection between low dose and cancer, I am concerned that all cancer will be viewed as radiation. This situation is like the atomic bomb case. In my opinion, it is against humanism to calculate the number of deaths. We should rethink the meaning of low dose radiation risk. I propose to develop two things. One is a total health risk evaluation. The other is a minus-dose evaluation. The total health risk evaluation is to be considered with radiation, ultra-violet ray, chemical material, mental stress, etc., to evaluate human health risk. Nowadays, only the radiation risk is evaluated quantitatively and gives some cause for anxiety. Therefore, it is important to know that radiation is not a special cancer risk compared with other risks even if this evaluation has a huge uncertainty. Moreover, minus-dose evaluation is more important. Today, Linear Non-Threshold model (LNT model) can evaluate the cumulative radiation risk forever. Therefore, people have no way to escape radiation to reduce risk. On the other hand, we can find protection functions in our body, for example DNA repair, apoptosis, radioadaptive response, and immunity. This means radiation damage in our body is continually being repaired by these functions. To make quantity evaluations of these functions we can calculate that the dose was canceled by these minusdoses. For example, to increase our immunity function to reduce cancer risks quantitatively, we use methods of ordinary health promotion (for example, spas) so that our radiation risk will be canceled and our health will actually become better."

38,17,0.319,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"remains inadequate to address the emerging challenges to biodiversity, human development and planetary management (Costello et al. 2013d). It is well known that biodiversity is in world-wide decline (Butchart et al. 2010 summarises recent evidence). This impoverishment takes the form of local and global extinctions, but also more pervasive and subtle simpliï¬cation, hollowing-out and dominance by a few species of formerly complex, abundant and equitable ecosystems (e.g., see Pereira et al. 2012). The resources of the Earthâland, oceans, water, primary productivity and nutrientsâare increasingly appropriated by humans and their client species (Haberl et al. 2007). The process of human domination has been underway for nearly ten thousand years, ever since the domestication of crops and livestock, but has accelerated over the past century or two. It has reached such proportions that we have entered the âAnthropoceneââthe era when human actions are the dominant Earth-shaping force (Crutzen 2002). There is little doubt that the current and projected rate of biodiversity loss exceeds its rate of generation. As a result, the world is getting poorer in terms of the biological variation it supports. The loss of biodiversity has well-established immediate causes: the loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat needed for the completion of life histories; over-harvesting of organisms which have commercial value (and the collateral damage to other organisms and ecosystems in the process); pollution of the environment by biocides and the waste products of human activity; and competition, predation or infection by invasive alien species deliberately or inadvertently introduced from other parts of the world are the leading causes (SCBD 2010). Climate change during the 21st century is projected to be high up on this list of the causes for biodiversity loss. The contemporary decline in diversity is not entirely without precedent. On at least ï¬ve previous occasions in the approximately ï¬ve billion year history of this living planet, biodiversity has undergone relatively abrupt decreases (Leakey and Lewin 1995). In some cases, this has been the result of the rise to dominance of a new group of organisms, such as the evolution of oxygen-generating algae three billion years ago, which conï¬ned the previously dominant anaerobic bacteria to low-oxygen niches. In other cases, it is attributed to cataclysmic events such as the impact of an asteroid. Although previous episodes of biodiversity loss have left a lasting imprint on the biota of the world, biodiversity overall has always recovered, often in different forms. Disruption of the old order may even have been the stimulus for biological innovation. For instance, the end of domination by dinosaurs may have allowed a relatively obscure group of proto-mammals to evolve, ultimately, into our own species. Why then are we concerned about the current loss of diversity? First, the current loss of biodiversity is just one element of an interconnected syndrome known as âGlobal Changeâ. Another element is climate change, mostly driven by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and release of other waste gases. A key driver of both climate change and biodiversity loss is the ongoing transformation of the surface of the planet due to human activities, including agriculture, deforestation, settlements, transport infrastructure, ï¬shing and"

230,6,0.318,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"The accumulation of litter at sea and along coastlines worldwide and the many open questions concerning the amount, distribution and fate of marine litter and potential implications for marine wildlife and humans have raised public awareness, stimulated scientific research and initiated political action to tackle this environmental problem (UNEP 2014). Identification, quantification and sampling of marine litter do not necessarily require professional scientific skills so that NGOs as well as committed citizens and other stakeholders have contributed substantially to the collection of data on marine litter pollution and to the global perception of the problem (Rosevelt et al. 2013; Anderson and Alford 2014; Smith and Edgar 2014). Scientists, politicians, authorities, NGOs and industries have started to share knowledge at international conferences aimed at developing managerial solutions. These joint activities, public awareness and, finally, the scientific curiosity of numerous committed researchers have stimulated a rapidly increasing number of publications from various scientific disciplines in dedicated volumes (Coe and Rogers 1997; Thompson et al. 2009). This latest volume on Marine Anthropogenic Litter was inspired by the remarkable recent progress in marine litter research. A large proportion of the references reviewed in this book was published in the last three years demonstrating the topicality of this book and the issue as a whole. Because of the high dynamics in this field of research, this volume may already be outdated when published. This book consists of five major sections. In the first section, Peter Ryan gives a historical synopsis of marine litter research starting from the first mention of floating debris in the famous novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in 1870 but with a focus on the past 50 years, which have seen a strong increase in the production of plastics. The reader will learn about the rapid development of this research field, and a series of international key conferences such as the âHonolulu Conferencesâ, which brought together scientists, environmentalists, industry, NGOs and policy makers and fuelled numerous publications and new research and management schemes. The second section of the book addresses abiotic aspects of marine litter pollution. FranÃ§ois Galgani, Georg Hanke and Thomas Maes portray the abundance, global distribution and composition of marine litter, which illustrates the ubiquity of litter in the oceans from the urban centres of human activity to the Earthâs remotest sites. Anthony L. Andrady describes the physical and chemical processes involved in the degradation of plastics in the marine environment. The third section of the book covers the biological and ecological implications of marine litter. Susanne KÃ¼hn, Elisa L. Bravo Rebolledo and Jan A. van Franeker summarize the deleterious effects of litter on marine wildlife. The authors compiled an extensive list of 580 species, ranging from invertebrates to fish, turtles, birds and mammals that have been shown to suffer from the effects of marine litter. Toxicity of contaminants associated with marine plastic debris as well as health implications is described by Chelsea Rochman who demonstrates that plastics are more than a mechanic threat to marine biota. Tim Kiessling, Lars Gutow and Martin Thiel show how marine litter facilitates the dispersal of marine organisms, which are capable of colonizing litter items floating at the sea surface. The authors compiled a list of 387 taxa that have been found rafting on floating litter,"
169,253,0.318,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Sediments play a crucial role in the life cycles of many riverine ï¬sh species. This is not surprising since ï¬sh fauna had to evolve within the frame of habitat conditions governed by sediment dynamics. Fishes developed strategies or adaptions to cope with dynamic and often stochastically changing sediment conditions. Extensive sediment transport and related relocation are generally destructive events decreasing the survival of incubated egg and juvenile stages of salmonids (e.g., CattanÃ©o et al. 2002; LobÃ³n-CerviÃ¡ and RincÃ³n 2004; Unfer et al. 2011). While the older life stages can actively search for cover, early juvenile stages are exposed to erosive forces that result in high mortality rates. On the other hand, ï¬ood events and related sediment relocation reshape the riverbed and reï¬ne potential spawning ground for the upcoming spawning period (Poff et al. 1997; Unfer et al. 2011). For gravel-spawning ï¬sh species (lithophilic, most rheophilic species in Europe, such as salmonids and many cyprinids, Fig. 8.4), suitable spawning sediment (bed material composition) and further abiotic components such as water temperature,"

The situation is direr in Haiti, where fully twothirds of all children in this age group did not eat animal products. In some countries, there are also clear socioeconomic gradients. In Bolivia, for example, the probability that a child has been given animal products is 16 percentage points lower amongst the poorest households in the survey than among the richest ones.3 Figure 3.2 Percent of Children 6â24 Months Whose Parents Gave Them Animal Products in the Past 24 Hours, by Wealth Quintile a.

97,168,0.318,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Cities, if exposed to hazards, are hotspots of vulnerability due to the concentration of people and infrastructures. It is increasingly acknowledged that the human vulnerability to natural hazards is the result of the socio-economic, physical and environmental processes that characterise a social-ecological system and is thus socially constructed (Oliver-Smith 1999). This view of hazards is even more relevant in urban areas where the environment is highly modified by physical infrastructures and socio-economic activities. Cities are centres of interchange of knowledge, cultures, innovations and goods. To facilitate exchanges, these are often located in the proximity of rivers and seas making them exposed to a number of hazards such as storms, flooding, cyclones, coastal erosion and sea level rise (Sherbinin et al. 2007). Urban sprawl can exacerbate impacts of hazards through âpoor urban management, inadequate planning, high population density, inappropriate construction, ecological imbalances and infrastructure dependencyâ (Jacobs 2005). As a result, cities of developed countries may face the highest impacts in terms damages assets and economic losses (Dickson et al. 2012). In the US, catastrophic events have increased in the last 35 years according to MunichRe NatCatService.1 In healthy environments, ecosystems do not strictly experience disaster in the same way that we consider disaster in the human context. When discussing risks to ecosystems, ecologists tend to discuss this in terms of disturbance (e.g. Attiwill 1994; Swetnam and Betancourt 2010). In fact, variation and extremes in weather and climate and other disturbances have always been part of the functioning of natural ecosystems and provide a wide range of benefits such as soil fertilization in floodplains in the case of floods or groundwater recharge in the case of intense precipitation events associated, for instance, with typhoons. However, major impacts on the ecosystem might occur if hazards affect a degraded and less diverse ecosystems, as is often the case in and around cities (Alberti 2005). This could translate to a temporary or even permanent decline or impairment in supplying necessary ecosystem services to urban and peri-urban areas. Mitigating and adapting to climate change in and around cities thus needs to take into account the interacting effects of the built infrastructure and climate change on the ecological or biophysical components of local and regional ecosystems. If we are to utilize nature-based solutions (NBS) for CCA and DRR, then the health and function of urban ecosystems is of primary importance for providing effective climate regulating services. https://www.munichre.com/en/reinsurance/business/non-life/natcatservice/index.html (Retrieved on 13th of October 2016)."

233,495,0.318,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Conservation Cost The cost for each PU was obtained from WWF (Soares et al. 2012). The database was built by the Conservation Science Team based on potential future deforestation, using Land Change Modeler module of Idrisi Selva. Distance to roads, to cities, to infrastructure and to previously deforested areas were included as driver to changes in land cover from 2002 to 2010, and then applied to 2010 natural vegetation map to predict which areas are more likely to be deforested in the next 10 years. Focal Species Eighty-two out of 209 amphibian species known to occur in the Cerrado (Valdujo et al. 2012) were selected as focal species. The criteria were based on endemism, range size (both obtained from Valdujo et al. 2012) and level of tolerance to anthropogenic alterations in habitat quality (two classes: tolerant and nottolerant; species were classiï¬ed based in our ï¬eld experience, so that species commonly seen in disturbed areas were considered as tolerant). We used both endemism and extent of distribution as independent criteria because some species are endemic to the Cerrado but have a wide range within this biome, whereas some other species are range restricted (e.g. <60,000 km2) but occur in a transition zone between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, and so they are not endemic to the Cerrado (Valdujo et al. 2012). Since we were prioritizing among natural areas within the Cerrado, widespread species do not add to the ï¬nal solution, and neither do species that can tolerate habitat degradation. Species Distribution Models We prepared geographic distribution maps for all 82 species, using distribution models constructed through the Maximum Entropy algorithm â MAXENT (Elith et al. 2006; Phillips and Dudik 2008). We included as predictors elevation and all 19 bioclimatic variables with a 10 arc-min spatial resolution provided by Worldclim (Hijmans et al. 2005). For each species we used the mean model of 20 runs and converted probabilistic models to binary models using the 10 percentile training presence logistic threshold. Distribution maps were lately validated by a group of experts during a workshop organized by the Ministry of Environment and WWF aiming to identify priority areas for biodiversity conservation in the Cerrado, in 2011, following the procedure recommended by Graham and Hijmans (2006). The distribution map for each species was superimposed onto the PUsâ map in order to calculate how much of its distribution area is contained in each PU. All distribution maps were overlaid to obtain the richness surface of endemic species of amphibians in the Cerrado. Evolutionary History Prioritization In some cases the outcome of area prioritization through SCP analyses fails to meet all targets. To ensure that at least the most important species meet their targets, it is possible to set a penalty factor (SPF) for each species that penalizes solutions more heavily when not achieving these targets. We assigned SPF based on both threat and phylogeny, using ED scores (Evolutionarily Distinctiveness) obtained from Isaac et al. (2012), ranging from 4669 to 17,903. Mapping Total Evolutionary Distinctiveness We calculate the total ED of each PU by summing the value of all species occurring in it. As ED is highly correlated with richness, here we used a weighted value, obtained by dividing summed ED by richness in each PU."

70,605,0.317,Optics in Our Time,"We all need medical care, from the day we are born, until the day we die. However, this need for medical care has now been affected and accentuated by a convergence of social, demographic, economic, environmental, and political global trends that have been developing over the last few decades. It is a world full of challenges that impact how to effective deliver healthcare in an effective, affordable, and sustainable fashion. On one hand, average lifestyles have changed drastically in the past century resulting in a more sedentary lifestyle with lack of exercise, poor diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption that have resulted in a growing number of chronic diseases such as obesity, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer that have become leading causes of death and disability. On the other hand, the entire global population keeps growing. According to a recent United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) report the worldâs population is estimated to be in excess of 7.3 billion and growing at ~1.1 % annual rate, and expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100 [2]. As illustrated in . Fig. 13.1 , the world population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death back in 1350, when the total population stood at merely 370 million. Nowadays, total annual births are approximately 135 million/year, while deaths are around 56 million/year, but expected to increase to 80 million/year by 2040. Add to this the fact that in certain parts of the world the population is aging, including the USA, Japan, and parts of Europe. Globally, the number of persons aged 65 or older is expected to reach to nearly 1.5 billion by 2050. An aging population puts additional demands on healthcare since older people are more vulnerable to illness and chronic diseases. Furthermore, life expectancy at birth has increased signiï¬cantly. The UN DESA estimates a 6-year average gain in life expectancy among the poorest countries, from 56 years in 2000â2005 to 62 years in 2010â2015, which is roughly double the increase recorded for the rest of the world. Another key trend and global challenge is the expected shortage of medical doctors and physicians available to meet the healthcare needs of a growing world population."

38,178,0.317,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"cultural services include, among others, charismatic species (e.g., monarch butterflies, primates, orchids) and species inspiring technology (e.g., Morpho butterflies, lotus plants). Therefore, a decrease in the species abundance or species range of a game bird or a primate species corresponds to a decrease in the supply of the associated provisioning or cultural service. In other situations, species do not constitute ï¬nal services or goods, but are known to play a facilitator or intermediary role in the ecosystem processes underpinning the services. This is particularly true for regulating services (i.e., non-material ecosystem outputs not directly used by people but that affect human well-being) such as water run-off regulation or pollination, but also for some provisioning or cultural services such as clean water provision and landscape character. While individual species may play a dominant role in ecosystem processes generating services, for example, fruit tree pollination by honey bees, in most cases, ecosystem processes are affected by multiple species in a community (DÃ­az et al. 2007; Hillebrand and Matthiessen 2009; Lavorel et al. 2011). In these situations, data on species abundance and distribution obtained through monitoring schemes can be complemented with data on species traits (i.e., morphological, physiological and life history attributes), in order to compute community-aggregated metrics that characterise the community regarding traits of interest for a particular function. For example, data on root size and architecture can be used to assess the contribution of plant communities to water regulation and soil stability, and data on body size and feeding habits can be used to assess the pollination potential of insect communities (de Bello et al. 2010). Species traits can also be applied in the identiï¬cation of species functional groups relevant to monitoring provisioning, cultural or regulating ecosystem services. For instance, protein content could be an indicator of plantsâ forage value in pastures (Lavorel et al. 2011), production of medicinally important compounds, such as antioxidants and alkaloids, could be an indicator of medicinal value (Canter et al. 2005), and structural complexity could be an indicator of existence value (ProenÃ§a et al. 2008). In addition to the traits determining species contribution to ecosystem processes, ï¬nal services or goods (effect traits), species can also be characterised by traits shaping their responses to pressures (response traits). These two categories of traits provide complementary information regarding species interaction with their environment, that is, species responses to external drivers and species input to ecosystem processes and services. Response traits, such as ï¬re response traits (e.g., resprouting ability, serotiny) and habitat specialisation, can be used to assess or predict the impacts of drivers of change or conservation measures on species populations and communities. The borderline between the two categories is not strict, as some effect traits may also be response traits. For example, leaf area has an effect on evapotranspiration, and hence on water regulation, but it can also respond to drought or nutrient availability. Response traits are not only reactive to pressures, providing a way of tracking their impacts on a certain area, but also to the variation of abiotic conditions across a landscape or region (Lavorel et al. 2011). Therefore, data on abiotic variables, such as climate and physiography, are also needed when monitoring ecosystem services using species data, since abiotic factors indirectly"
222,229,0.317,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"floods, (ii) tidal floods, (iii) fluvio-tidal floods and (iv) storm surge floods. While all types of floods can cause damage and disruption, coastal Bangladesh is best known for storm surge flooding due to large historic death toll associated with some of these events most notably between 1970 and 1991 (Nicholls 2006; Alam and Dominey-Howes 2015; Lumbroso et al. 2017). Fluvial and fluvio-tidal flooding is largely dictated by the flow in the major rivers of the delta due to precipitation and run-off upstream. The study area in this research (see Chap. 4, Fig. 4.2) has a large tidal range (three to six metres) which can cause tidal flooding in unprotected (un-poldered) areas. The magnitude of storm surge flooding due to tropical cyclones is also related to the tide; landfall of a cyclone during high tide can cause more extensive storm surge flooding, while cyclone landfall at low tide may not be noticed in terms of water level. The consequences for the resident population are therefore varied. Coastal Bangladesh has an extensive system of coastal embankments and polders built since the 1960s with the goal to reduce flooding, manage water levels and enhance agriculture. While reducing the extent and frequency of coastal flooding, these have greatly modified the flood characteristics and associated coastal morphodynamics and rates of subsidence (e.g. Auerbach et al. 2015). Moreover, there are plans for substantial upgrade to some embankments as part of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BanDuDeltAS 2014). In this chapter, a general overview of the four types of floods defined above is provided, followed by a summary and refection on the need for further research on flooding in coastal Bangladesh. More details of the flood modelling conducted in this research are given in Chap. 16."

As indicated by the test statistics, each method produced a plausible present distribution and estimate of habitats suitable for each species (14 commercial ï¬sh). When used to make projections into the future, the ensemble of models suggested northward shifts at an average rate of 27 km per decade (the current rate is around 20 km per decade for common ï¬sh in the North Sea, Dulvy et al. 2008). This modelling approach was extended to include several additional, commercial species (squid Loligo vulgaris, seabass, sardine, sprat, John dory, anchovy, plaice, herring, mackerel, halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus, red mullet etc.) as part of a Defra study (Defra 2013). The species predicted to move the furthest were anchovy, sardine, Greenland halibut, John dory and seabass (i.e. E. encrasicolus, S. pilchardus, R. hippoglossoides, Z. faber and D. labrax respectively, see Fig. 12.4). By contrast Rutterford et al. (2015) used the same ï¬sh survey datasets for the North Sea, together with generalised additive models (GAMs), to predict trends in the future distribution of species, but came to the conclusion that ï¬sh species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by the availability of suitable habitat in the North Sea, especially in terms of preferred depths. The authors found no consistent pattern among species in predicted changes in distribution. On the basis of the GAM results the authors suggested that they did not expect or predict substantial further deepening (as previously observed by Dulvy et al. 2008), and that the capacity of ï¬sh to remain in cooler water by changing their depth distribution had been largely exhausted by the 1980s, that ï¬sh with preferences for cooler water are being increasingly exposed to higher temperatures, with expected physiological, life history and negative population consequences. Beaugrand et al. (2011) described a model to map the future spatial distribution of Atlantic cod. The model, which they named the non-parametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN), suggested that cod may eventually disappear as a commercial species from some regions including the North Sea where a sustained decline has already been documented; in contrast, the abundance of cod is likely to increase in the Barents Sea. Lenoir et al. (2011) applied the same NPPEN model with multiple explanatory variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, and bathymetry) to predict the distribution of eight ï¬sh species up to the 2090s for the Northeast Atlantic. This study anticipated that by the 2090s horse mackerel and anchovy would show an increased probability of occurrence in northern waters compared with the 1960s, that pollack Pollachius pollachius, haddock and saithe would show a decrease in the south, and that turbot Scophthalmus maximus and sprat would show no overall change in probability (â0.2 to +0.2) anywhere."

Features on fatalities caused by different types of hazards can be found for instance in natural hazard databases (e.g. EM-DAT, DISASTER) based on documental sources, demographic statistics, death certiï¬cates and civil protection authorities. There are some constraints in the inclusion criteria of mortality data in disaster databases. For instance, the EM-DAT only record disasters that have caused at least 10 fatalities, while the DISASTER database includes every landslide that caused fatalities regardless of their number. EM-DAT underestimates the numbers of fatalities and the fatalities are usually associated to the triggering event, such as earthquake, storm and floods (Haque et al. 2016). Another constraint to study the mortality caused by landslides is the relatively short time span of the existing databases and the lack of ï¬eld validation (Petley 2012). In Portugal, social impacts caused by landslides and floods occurred in the period 1865â2015 are gathered in the DISASTER database. This database includes social consequences (fatalities, injuries, missing people, evacuated people and homeless people) caused by landslides documented in newspapers (ZÃªzere et al. 2014). The DISASTER database contains 291 damaging landslides that caused 238 fatalities. In the present work we explore the mortality patterns resulting from damaging landslides occurred in Portugal since 1865. In this work we aim to: (i) analyse the spatio-temporal analysis of damaging landslides; (ii) analyse the frequency and the temporal evolution of fatal landslides; (iii) analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of fatalities generated by landslides; (iv) identify the most deadly landside types; (v) verify gender tendencies in mortality resulting from landslides; and (vi) evaluate the individual and societal risk."

Market failure will be the rule. Moreover, climate change has a significant impact on the frequency of catastrophic events worldwide. The data from the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction show a dramatic increase in the occurrence of natural disasters, particularly of hydro-meteorological events during the last century (OECD, 2009). It is clear that not all agricultural risks are insurable:14 insurance contracts for some risks do not exist because the insurance premium covering all the costs would be prohibitive (OECD, 2009). Miranda and Glauber (1997) emphasize the need for risk to be independent among the insured, arguing that due to correlations among individual yields, crop insurers face portfolio risk that is about ten times larger than that faced by private insurers offering more conventional lines of insurance (automobile, fire, etc). And also reinsurers are reluctant to take portfolios with a probability of very large obligations. Natural disasters like the Tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2006, the earthquake in Haiti in 2008, and the recent countrywide flooding in Pakistan in 2010 are examples of catastrophic risk where market instruments break down and which call for the government, supported by the international donor community, to step in with emergency aid, disaster relief, and safety net provision.

It turns out that life can be made much more straightforward if the analysis can be reformulated as an exercise in proportions rather than counts, because if it can, then all of the problems with nuisance variables disappear. On p. 643 the example is reanalysed with the response variable as a proportion in a GLM with binomial errors. This is possible because we have just two species, so we can reformulate the response as the proportion of all lizards that are A. opalinus.

Consequently, smaller management units will often require greater economic and management inputsâsupplementary feeding, licks, and controlled movementâto compensate for limited adaptive foraging options available to herbivores on large landscapes. Larger management units enhance an animalâs ability and freedom to respond to variable requirements and the changing environment without management interference (Hobbs et al. 2008). Wild and domestic herbivores, whether grazers or browsers, must cope with elevated requirements for protein, energy, and minerals during certain life stages (Murray 1995; Parker et al. 2009) that may not match resource patterns due to weather and plant phenology, especially when landscapes are small and compartmentalized (Ellis and Swift 1988; Owen-Smith 2004). It is critical that we understand that periods of limited forage biomass and quality may be most important to herbivore populations, rather than average conditions across space and time (Hempson et al. 2015). Landscape or regional-level variability in plant community composition and productivityâinherent and/or disturbance drivenâis important on many rangelands. For example, on African rangelands high-quality short grass sites provide excellent wet-season grazing, but they generally provide little growth and forage during dry periods (McNaughton and Banyikwa 1995; Fynn et al. 2014). By contrast, greater soil moisture availability for dry-season forage production is found in low-lying, poorly drained positions in the landscape such as various wetland types and floodplains (Vesey-FitzGerald 1960; Pamo 1998), as well as in high-rainfall regions receiving significant rainfall during the dry season (Breman and de Wit 1983; McNaughton and Banyikwa 1995). Shallow water tables of wetland sites enable perennial grasses to regrow after fire in the dry season, thereby providing quality regrowth for herbivores (Vesey-FitzGerald 1960; Fynn et al. 2014). Access to green regrowth after fire in the dry season may greatly increase dry-season protein intake for herbivores (Parrini and OwenSmith 2010). In the absence of fire, taller coarser grasses may be left uneaten, thereby forming a drought-refuge resource for herbivores if rains fail. Such uneaten resources of productive perennial grasses can buffer herbivore populations against the effects of drought, despite their low quality, and have been referred to as buffer resources (Owen-Smith 2002) or key resources (Illius and OâConnor 2000). Loss of access to these key resource areas can result in herbivore population crashes during droughts (Fynn and Bonyongo 2011). Soil texture also plays an important role in facilitating moisture available for growth during the dry season with sandy soils generally supporting growth later into the dry season than clay soils (Sala et al. 1988; McNaughton and Banyikwa 1995). Heterogeneity in clay and sandy soils across landscapes contributes to variation in soil water availability and habitat productivity on strongly developed catenas. When these inherent patterns interact with disturbances such as fire, functional heterogeneity and adaptive foraging options for herbivores are maximized allowing animals to deal with environmental stress. It is important to note that pastoralists of West Africa and wild herbivores that share landscapes follow similar"
291,86,0.316,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"9.1 Decomposing Seasonal Data The majority of deaths in most countries can be attributed to causes that feature a distinct seasonal pattern. Figure 9.1 depicts the relative monthly frequencies of nine selected causes of death in the United States for women and men combined for the years 1959â2014. The reported number of counts in parentheses in the title of each panel is the actual number of deaths. To control for varying lengths of months, the monthly columns in each histogram have been adjusted for a uniform length (30 days). The horizontal reference lines denote the expected value of a uniform distribution (=1/12). The typical distribution follows a sinusoidal pattern with highest mortality in winter and relatively few cases in the summer. Primarily, those are circulatory diseases (e.g., heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases)âas shown in the first row of Fig. 9.1âand respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (âCOPDâ), pneumonia or influenza (Eurowinter Group 1997, 2000; Mackenbach et al. 1992; Kunst et al. 1990; Rau 2007; Yen et al. 2000; Seretakis et al. 1997), which are displayed in three horizontal panels in the middle of Fig. 9.1.

Mongolian gazelles in the eastern steppe of Mongolia have nomadic movements that are more irregular than those of other ungulate species, such as caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, which exhibit regular seasonal migration, or the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in Argentina and moose (Alces alces) in the northeastern United States, both of which move shorter distances with more predictable movements (Mueller et al. 2011).

While this phenomenon (known locally as a âjubileeâ) occurs mainly in estuarine waters, hypoxic events also occur in nearshore marine waters. In areas of the GoM that are frequently or chronically impacted by hypoxia, benthos tends to be dominated by short-lived, small deposit-feeding polychaetes, and long-lived infauna and epifauna are rare (Rabalais et al. 2002). Some common nekton species in the GoM, including penaeid shrimps, have a degree of tolerance for low oxygen conditions (Rosas et al. 1999), but most actively avoid hypoxic conditions (Renaud 1986). Localized and short-term cyclic hypoxic episodes may be common in tidal creeks of estuaries (Tyler et al. 2009), but nekton are capable of quickly emigrating from areas affected by localized hypoxia and repopulating the area when conditions improve (Hackney et al. 1976). Mangroves are susceptible to damage by prolonged freeze conditions. Stevens et al. (2006) reported on the role of freezing on mangrove density and seedling establishment, and fluctuations in comparison to salt marsh species. Others have examined the effects of freezing on the structure of dwarf mangrove forests in Florida and how this may change mangrove diversity in the future with a warmer climate (Ross et al. 2009)."

It is found throughout the Caribbean Sea and southern Gulf of Mexico, and it ranges as far north as Bermuda and as far south as Brazil (CFMC 1996). Because the queen conch is prized for its meat and shell, population declines began throughout its range prior to the 1960s; however, most authorities and fishers did not acknowledge that overharvesting was occurring until the 1980s (Brownell and Stevely 1981; Iversen and Jory 1985; Appeldoorn and Meyers 1993; CFMC 1996). Conch fisheries in some localities, such as Florida Keys and Cuba, virtually collapsed due to overharvest (CFMC 1996). Once common on the Veracruz coral reefs, the queen conch essentially disappeared from that area in the 1980s (Tunnell et al. 2007). Likewise, it was common and being overfished during the 1980s on Alacran and other Campeche Bank reefs, but now it has low population levels due to overharvesting (Figure 8.3) (Baqueiro 2004; Diaz-de-Leon et al. 2004; Tunnell et al. 2007). Historically, the queen conch ranked second only to the spiny lobster in terms of export value of Caribbean-wide fishery products, and only second to a variety of finfish (mostly reef fish) in terms of local consumption (CFMC 1996). Even archaeological evidence strongly suggests its use and importance as a food source long before discovery of the New World (Stevely 1979). However, even though queen conch were once abundant and an important fishery resource throughout the wider Caribbean, today most localities no longer have a viable fishery due to overfishing (CFMC 1996). In the United States, in the Florida Keys and surrounding area, commercial and sport conch fisheries (taken by hand while snorkeling or diving) had completely collapsed by the mid-1970s, primarily due to overharvest. Commercial harvest of queen conch was banned in the Florida Keys in 1975, and a ban on all commercial and recreational harvest was implemented in 1986 (CFMC 1996; SEDAR 2007). In Mexico, the queen conch fishery has deteriorated (Diaz-deLeon et al. 2004), but some exploitation continues on Alacran and other Campeche Bank coral reefs. In Cuba, due to intense harvesting and overexploitation, takings have been prohibited since 1992, except small-quota catches permitted under special authorization in very selected areas (Claro et al. 2001, 2009). Interestingly, in Cuba the queen conch was historically, and even recently, taken as not only food but for bait. In all localities, the shells of the queen conch have historically been used in the shell-craft and handicraft trades."

The WDI is an indicator of the irrigation water consumption related to the available water for irrigation in a river basin. â Consumption-to-availability (CTA), which relates annual water consumption with annual water availability. â Withdrawal-to-availability (WTA), which relates annual water withdrawal with annual water availability. However, relative water scarcity is not a direct and universal indicator of ecological damage nor directly related to local economic opportunity costs of annual water use. For example, geographic and temporal scale effects make it difï¬cult to assess social and ecological effects from comparing annual consumption (or withdrawal) and water availability. For example, water availability might be unequally distributed with a water basin, within the year, and among years. This makes that on the one hand water scarcity might be felt in certain places and periods when annual averages do no indicate any water scarcity problems. On the other hand transfer and storage of water can alleviate water scarcity. Moreover, other important local circumstances like cultural value of water and unequal distribution of beneï¬ts and costs of the use of the water are not included in the virtual water impact indicator. The impact indicators are (explicitly or implicitly) claimed to be âuniversalâ and therefore allow for comparison (âbenchmarkingâ) among all places of the globe. However, the âimpact indicatorsâ do not take into account local history, justice nor ecological values. The indicators are not deï¬ned by local stakeholders or deprived groups, thus impeding those stakeholders to include evaluation criteria that would include their views and suite their needs and interests (see also Boelens and Vos 2012; Vos and Boelens 2014). International trade of âluxuryâ products like fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers doubled during the past decade, while also the export of for example biofuel crop production is booming. In dry and semi-arid regions, these high-water-consuming crops have in common that they compete for water and land with local communities, deplete and degenerate local ecosystems, worsen local and national food sovereignty, and alter existing modes of production and income distribution. For example, Peru increased tenfold its export of fruits and vegetables from the dry desert coast from 2001 to 2015 (Fig. 1). Ecuador tripled its flower export from the fragileâdrought proneâAndean hill slopes North of Quito in the same period, and is now the third flower exporting country in the world (Fig. 2). Multinational and national companies have also acquired land and water rights to start large-scale production of sugarcane for biofuels in the desert North Coast of Peru showing sharp increase of export since 2008 (Fig. 3). Increased virtual water use by water-intensive crops in dry and semi-arid regions by agro-export companies increases the environmental consequences of depletion of surface and groundwater resources.

Nevertheless, we should remember that reindeer herding is one of the most dangerous occupations with major accident hazards and that there are very worrying trends in high suicide rates among young reindeer herders. The Sami have increased their political influence. Since the early 1900s a relatively successful political mobilization, including the establishment of Sami Parliaments in Norway, Sweden and Finland, has occurred in the Sami society. Despite the advance in many areas the Sami are still dependent on decisions by the State and the majority society on most issues. And there is still vulnerability in the Sami society. Reindeer herding, which is an important part of the Sami culture, are working under difficult economic and legal conditions. The Sami languages are fighting for its survival. We know that language and identity are closely linked. A stereotyped image of the Sami is still prevalent today and a general ignorance has been due to inadequate teaching and learning materials ignoring. This is an essential part of the Sami issues of today. Traditional knowledge and values threatens to be lost in a shrinking cultural space, while the Sami complexity and modernization has meant that more and more lose their Sami identity. And a crucial question is how much we really know about the Sami health situation."

This is sometimes a problem in that the smaller the quantity of sediments and other materials transported in the discharged water, the greater the quantity that can be picked up and transported as it moves downstream. Because it contains less sediment, the discharged ââhungryââ water can scour and erode the streambed and banks, picking up new sediment as it continues downstream. This scouring effect can negatively impact the flora, fauna, and biological community structure in the downstream river channel. The removal of sediments from a river by reservoirs also has important biological effects, particularly on floodplains."
241,395,0.314,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"study suggests that warmer winters cause later freeze-up dates and shorter ice-cover duration on the rivers. Long-term observations of the Nemunas (1812-2006) at the Smalininkai station indicate that in the nineteenth century, ice cover formed on average 13 days earlier and remained unbroken on average for 30 days longer than in the twentieth century. Applying the MannâKendall trend test to the data showed very signiï¬cant trends in the Nemunas ice data series of the last century: a negative trend in ice duration data and a positive trend in freeze-up date data. According to the icecover data, the Kaunas Hydro Power Plant has the largest anthropogenic impact on the Nemunas ice processes. After the dam was constructed in 1959, ice duration at Kaunas and LampÄdÅ¾iai WMS decreased on average by 15 and 5 days, respectively, compared to the period 1931â1960. Observational data from 1991 to 2005 indicate a strong decrease in ice duration compared to earlier periods. In urban areas, human activities cause rivers to freeze-up later and the period of ice cover to be shorter. In Russia, the analysis of the interannual variation in ice phenomena dates and the duration of coverage for Lake Ladoga show very small but signiï¬cant trends (1â6 days per 100 years). The trend is most marked for freeze-up dates (14 days per 100 years) but the coefï¬cient of determination is no more than 3 % (Karetnikov and Naumenko 2008). Change in the thermal regime of the near surface water layer is revealed by the increase in duration of the ice-free period on Lake Onego (Onega) (Salo and Nazarova 2011). By the end of the twentieth century, the number of ice-free days had increased from 217 to 225 days on average (Fig. 5.20). The authors argued that the dates of ice-cover formation and decay on Lake Onego are determined not only by autumn and spring temperatures but also by large-scale processes characterised, for example, by the NAO index. Figure 5.21 illustrates the"
230,306,0.314,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"7.3 Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Abundance of Microplastics Our understanding about the distribution and the factors affecting the distribution of microplastics in the oceans is limited and much of the sampling to date has been opportunistic utilizing existing research programs (research cruises, educational programs, routine plankton monitoring) to collect material. There has also been some targeted microplastic sampling and attempts to make formal comparisons in the abundance of microplastics between locations (Browne et al. 2010, 2011). Existing data indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in surface waters, in shallow waters (Browne et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012), in deepsea sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013) and in the digestive tract of a range of organisms living within these habitats (Lusher 2015). With the exception of heavily contaminated areas such as shipbreaking yards (Reddy et al. 2006), the abundance of microplastics would appear to be relatively low in surface waters and sediments (see Lusher 2015). By volume it is apparent, however, that sediments are more contaminated than surface waters. However, because of their ubiquity, the total quantity of microplastics in the environment is considerable and in some locations represents the most numerous type of debris present (Browne et al. 2010). This ubiquity is also demonstrated by encounters when considered by marine species, of which around 10 % are with microplastics (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel GEF 2012). In terms of spatial patterns in abundance, at a global scale Browne et al. (2011) detected a weak relationship between the abundance of microplastics and human population density. Extensive sampling by Law et al. (2010) demonstrated the role of large-scale physical factors leading to increased abundance in the North Atlantic gyre far from the nearest land. She matched abundance data form the ocean surface with model predictions based on physical factors indicating that, at large scales, factors driving the abundance of debris can be used to make predictions about relative abundance (Law et al. 2010; Fig. 7.5). Formal comparisons also demonstrated patterns at smaller spatial scales with locations previously used for the dumping of sewage sludge having greater quantities of microplastic than control areas (Browne et al. 2011). In addition, intertidal sediments on shores that were downwind in relation to prevailing wind direction can have greater quantities of microplastic than those on shorelines that were up-wind (Browne et al. 2010). Targeted sampling has also indicated extremely high microplastic abundance near to a plastic processing plant in Sweden (NorÃ©n 2008). However, while the role of some potential sources including sewage and industrial spillage have been demonstrated together with the influence of physical factors leading to accumulation of debris in particular locations, our collective understanding of the relative importance of these factors in influencing spatial patterns of distribution or in making predictions about such is limited. Only a handful of studies have considered temporal patterns in the abundance of microplastics. Thompson et al. (2004) in the northeast Atlantic and Goldstein"

126,275,0.313,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Company boats easily overwhelm the poorly equipped indigenous Dasanech and Turkana ï¬shers. Villagers in the delta describe enormous ï¬sh discard (waste) by the motorized commercial boats, including large deposits of ï¬sh bones and other waste, that create major problems for their small nets and also destroy ï¬sh reproductive and feeding habitats. One Dasanech ï¬sher responded this way when asked for his view of the foreign ï¬shing boats: What is bad about them is the amount of ï¬sh they kill. Some of them [ï¬llet] the ï¬sh right there and throw the waste in the lake, so this makes the lake water poisoned. We get small nets from some of them, but mostly we are losing our ï¬sh, so nets donât help us if the ï¬sh are gone. The Ethiopia-based ï¬shing corporations have steadily increased their catch range into Kenyaâs Lake Turkana, where they are in clear violation of that nationâs sovereignty. These company boats extend their ï¬shing ventures as far southward as North Island (Figs. 1.3 and 5.2), often display the Ethiopian flag and are often accompanied by Ethiopian guard boats. They pay no fees to Kenya, nor do they obtain ï¬shing licenses or make catch reports to Kenyaâs local Beach Management Units. Turkana representatives from villages along the northwestern shoreline have appealed to the Kenyan government numerous times to expel the foreign fleets, and Kenyan ï¬sheries ofï¬cials are fully aware of the situation. As of early 2015, the Kenyan government had taken no effective action, despite innumerable requests by Turkana ï¬shers and their representativesâ including in the locally based Beach Management Units. Nor have the development banks, in their assessments of lake conditions, ï¬shery status or socioeconomic conditions (AFDB 2009 and 2010) raised the issue of the incursion and impact of Ethiopian commercial fleets in these Kenyan waters on ï¬sh stocks and on the worsening interethnic conflict among ï¬shers. What amounts to state-sponsored piracy into Kenyan waters is a matter of international sovereignty, but also greatly worsens the crisis faced by vast numbers of Kenyaâs Turkana whose livelihood is dependent upon the lakeâs ï¬shery. â¢ Violent conflicts between Dasanech and Turkana ï¬shers who are increasingly desperate to secure catch from these northern waters constitute a major problem in the region. The northernmost portion of the lake accounts for many of the âhotspotsâ of conflict expansion (Fig.5.3). The frequent violence over gear theft and sporadic killings noted above frequently spreads to pastoral and agropastoral communities in the region (and visa versa) with extensive series of reprisals between the two ethnic groups. The frequent points of conflict among ï¬shersâindicated in the map of Fig. 5.3âare also the likely points of major expansion of local conflicts into regional ones. This trend is already well underway and is greatly ampliï¬ed by the plummeting of livelihood resources as a result of Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural development. Governmental, non-governmental and U.N.-based accounts of conflicts among ï¬shers and in the border region generally exclude consideration of the actual causes of this mounting crisis. Instead, the âsolutionsâ prescribed are most often either interethnic âmediationââwithout account of the real dynamics at playâor additional militarization by the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments, or both."

CPY can be applied by use of aerial spraying, chemigation, ground boom or air-blast sprayers, tractor-drawn spreaders, or hand-held equipment. Since the registration of CPY was last re-evaluated (USEPA 2004, 2008), there have been changes in how assessments of risks of chemicals used to protect agricultural crops are conducted. The amount of data available on mobility, persistence, and concentrations in the environment and toxicity of CPY to animals has increased. Most importantly, many methods and models for estimating concentrations in the environment and exposures to wildlife have improved significantly since the results of the last assessments were published (Giesy et al. 1999; Solomon et al. 2001). Also, patterns of use have changed in response to changes in cropping, pest pressure, introduction of genetically modified crop (GMO) technology, and competing pesticides. Uses of CPY are the primary determinants of the entry of CPY into the environment and its subsequent fate in the regions of use and beyond. The purpose of this paper is to provide a synopsis of uses and properties of CPY and the results risk assessments conducted for aquatic life and terrestrial biota. Mammals were not addressed in any of these risk assessments because they are less sensitive to CPY and do not have as large a potential for exposure as do birds. It was previously concluded that, if birds are not affected by a particular pattern of use, then mammals occurring in the same environment would also not be adversely affected (Solomon et al. 2001)."

During the workshop the participants nominated Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) as an additional driver. They even coined it a âsuperâ driver, and felt it necessary as a pre-condition for the discussion as a whole. The exercise Tiller et al. (2013) conducted was thus to explicitly identify what attitudes and risk perceptions stakeholders have for offshore aquaculture. The concrete risks or effects they identiï¬ed were, among others, related to loss of income, to extra costs incurring due to loss of gear, and to being excluded from the ï¬shing grounds. All the effects they considered ï¬t in the social typology category of Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests. Forster (2008) sets out to tackle some broader issues related to offshore aquaculture, including how the potential of offshore aquaculture ï¬t into the bigger picture of global food supply, how the assessed long term potential of offshore aquaculture may be important in evaluating current efforts to get it developed, and how offshore aquaculture should be judged in comparison to other methods of food production.2 He looked into the anticipated future need and demand for food and hence seafood, but also into other ways of making more productive use of the sea, including for energy production and animal feed. He further discussed some of the criteria to assess the sustainability of offshore aquaculture, as well as some of the major substantial issues. Thus, his deliberations point out to the typology item Effects on the wider economic and innovation system. Lastly, a recent study by Ferreira et al. (2014) in southern Portugal investigated interactions between inshore and offshore clam aquaculture through a modelling framework. This enabled them to consider production volumes in the two contrasting aquaculture settings, as well as the environmental effects and disease interactions between them. They could show that whilst the inshore aquaculture activity targets clams of high value, a substantial part of the primary production which is food for the clams originates from the offshore. The offshore area has one of the worldâs ï¬rst offshore aquaculture parks, 3.6 nm from the coast. The park has 60 leases for aquaculture production, 70% for ï¬nï¬sh cage culture and 30% for bivalve longline culture, covers 15 km2 and is at 30â60 m depth. Ferreira et al. (2014) found that the bivalve offshore production has caused a decrease of clam yields inshore. While this is replaced by the yields offshore, it is a source of stakeholder conflict. The authorsâ modelling of potential disease spread between the offshore and inshore systems made it possible to develop a risk exposure map. The authors argue that such quantitative models of interactions, including reduced yields for inshore stakeholder, demonstrate a need for âstrong governance to offset disease risksâ, and they stress âthe need to go beyond the conventional spatial planning toolset in order to ensure an ecosystem approach to aquaculture.â These ï¬ndings ï¬t into the social typology categories of Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution; Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests."
36,187,0.313,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"to this issue was one on the effects of salvage logging (see Sect. 4.1.4). This is especially concerning given the strict protection afforded to all bat species and particularly bat roosts under the EU Habitat Directive; this prohibits deliberate disturbance of all bats during any stage of their life cycle as well as the destruction of breeding sites or resting areas. As such, the timing of forest harvesting needs to consider whether bats may be roosting in targeted areas (e.g. Forestry Commission 2005). There are no such restrictions in Australia; though for New Zealand pine plantations, Borkin et al. (2011) recommends that harvests should be planned when bats are not heavily pregnant nor have non-volant dependents. In eastern North America, logging is currently restricted from 15 October through 31 March across the distribution of the endangered Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, as this bat uses live and dead trees as maternity sites during the growing season (USFWS 2009). Restrictions are further constrained to a start date of 15 November within 16 km of known hibernacula of the species (USFWS 2009). The implications of white-nose syndrome and the extensive mortalities of cave-hibernating bats in North America (USFWS 2012) are likely to add species of forest bats to the threatened and endangered species list in the USA, leading to further restrictions on logging. Missing in all of the dialogue, however, is any direct link of impact, or mortality of bats, during logging operations and studies of these potential impacts are needed (but see Borkin et al. 2011)."

182,76,0.313,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Youatt arrived on the scene, thereby preventing him from confirming or refuting the diagnosis of phthisis that he had made in life.87 Surgeon James Murie, who was appointed in 1865 as the ZSLâs first prosector, also fell foul of its prioritization of comparative over pathological anatomy. Like Spooner and Youatt, he owed his role at the zoo to its animalsâ propensity to disease and death. He was required to attend daily and dissect all of the zooâs dead animals in a new room constructed specially for the purpose. As well as determining why animals had died, he had to study their comparative anatomies, and organize the sale of their body parts to dealers, museums, and members of the scientific and medical communities. As revealed by the aforementioned case of the Dublin rhino, the RZSI also engaged in this commercial practice in order to recoup some of the financial losses caused by animal disease and death. In this way, dead zoo animals acquired afterlives beyond the zoo, as subjects of taxidermy, scientific research and museum display.88 Murie poured his energies into the development of âhospital medicineâ at the zoo. He kept detailed records of each animal he examined, their symptoms in life where ascertainable, and their pathology after death. He transformed individual cases into collective statistics, which laid bare the immense mortality in the zoo: in 1866, 684 (33%) out of a total 2073 animals perished. Murie also started to develop epidemiological perspectives on zoo animal diseases by identifying the commonest causes of death among different classes of animal, and their seasonality and distribution by age and length of time spent in the gardens. Perceiving no distinction between the causes of death in humans and animals, he analysed the latter using the disease categories drawn up by William farr at the Registrar Generalâs Office.89 He went on to draw lessons for how to improve animal health through public health interventions, such as housing and feeding.90 However, the ZSLâs Prosectorial Committee was not satisfied with his construction of intricate pathological and statistical analyses of animals and demanded that he turn his attention to comparative anatomical descriptions âfor the interest of"

36,112,0.313,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"4.5.1.1 General Patterns Despite numerous and increasing attempts to detect consistent responses of tropical bats to habitat fragmentation, studies to date suggest relatively few generalizations. At the population level, many studies have documented that abundance responses to fragmentation are highly species and ensemble specific. For instance, in the Neotropics, abundances of gleaning animalivorous bats (Pons and Cosson 2002; Meyer et al. 2008; Meyer and Kalko 2008a) and certain forest-dependent aerial insectivores (Estrada Villegas et al. 2010) decline in response to fragmentation, whereas frugivorous and nectarivorous bats often increase (Sampaio et al. 2003; Delaval and Charles-Dominique 2006; Meyer and Kalko 2008a). In the Paleotropics, insectivorous bat species that roost in tree cavities or foliage are more vulnerable to fragmentation than are cave-roosting species (Struebig et al. 2008, 2009). At the assemblage level, studies that have compared fragmented and continuous forest in terms of species richness, diversity, and composition demonstrate inconsistent responses (Cosson et al. 1999; Schulze et al. 2000; Estrada and Coates-Estrada 2002; Faria 2006). Differences among sites with regard to fragmentation history and structural contrast between fragments and the surrounding matrix complicate the detection of general patterns. This may be a more important issue for the study of tropical bats compared to other taxonomic groups because of the wide range of dispersal abilities exhibited by chiropteran species."

The means to establish monitoring programs for reservoir and river ï¬sheries all over BF have come from SUSFISH projectâs provision of equipment and training for surveying and monitoring as well as ï¬eld data that conï¬rm that ï¬sh and benthic macroinvertebrates can be used as bioindicators of conditions in and around aquatic ecosystems. On this basis, managers can monitor the status of ï¬sheries and surrounding habitats as well as trends in anthropogenic impacts on aquatic fauna. Education programs for students and government agents need to be established and integrated with university research programs. In BF, there are a number of ways to improve the governance of aquatic resources, especially ï¬sheries, and the sectors of society and surrounding landscapes that impact ï¬sheries (Fig. 27.6). At the national level, efforts should be made to forge a vision of sustainable ï¬sheries that is communicated to and made workable at all levels of society and governance. National level policy makers have failed to make a national future perspective of ï¬sheries operative either at the federal, regional, or local levels. A national âvisionâ has been recorded, but it remains theory on paper, not a practical, working vision that informs policy and implementation. Failure to lead and provide a unifying vision means that local as well as regional and national actors have no paradigm of ï¬sheries development to rally around and use as a baseline against which to measure policy performance. While indicators are lacking, evidence of failure accumulates. Infrastructure (ï¬sh ponds, refrigerators, ï¬sh weighing scales, ï¬sh shops) has been installed but either not maintained and allowed to decay or converted for private use. Such patent failures undermine trust in the government institutions that establish and execute programs, projects, and policies to develop infrastructure. National governance of ï¬sheries could be improved by harmonizing policies of different ministries such that their implementation reinforces each other. Fisheries sustainability depends on integration of policies governing a range of diverse activities, e.g., water, agriculture, forests, mining, and tourism. Institutional nomadism,"

230,16,0.312,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract This chapter traces the history of marine litter research from anecdotal reports of entanglement and plastic ingestion in the 1960s to the current focus on microplastics and their role in the transfer of persistent organic pollutants to marine food webs. The reports in Science of large numbers of plastic pellets in the North Atlantic in the early 1970s stimulated research interest in plastic litter at sea, with papers reporting plastics on the seafloor and impacting a variety of marine animals. The focus then shifted to high concentrations of plastic litter in the North Pacific, where novel studies reported the dynamics of stranded beach litter, the factors influencing plastic ingestion by seabirds, and trends in fur seal entanglement. By the early 1980s, growing concern about the potential impacts of marine litter resulted in a series of meetings on marine debris. The first two international conferences held in Honolulu by the US National Marine Fisheries Service played a key role in setting the research agenda for the next decade. By the end of the 1980s, most impacts of marine litter were reasonably well understood, and attention shifted to seeking effective solutions to tackle the marine litter problem. Research was largely restricted to monitoring trends in litter to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures, until the last decade, when concern about microplastics coupled with the discovery of alarming densities of small plastic particles in the North Pacific âgarbage patchâ (and other mid-ocean gyres) stimulated the current wave of research.

This goes some way to remedying the loss of farm labouring opportunities, caused by low labour requirements on ghers, particularly shrimp farming (Swapan and Gavin 2011). Aquaculture is associated with a loss of open-access resources. In brackish water shrimp areas, salinity precludes other ecosystem services. However, freshwater prawn can be cultivated in rotation with other crops, vegetables can be grown on pond walls, and there is sufficient plant life for animal fodder. Freshwater prawn cultivation is also associated with a loss of open-access wetland areas which has provided security of income for those with land but reduced open-access resources for the landless (5): â Earlier we had the freedom for fishing in the beel [a wetland], now we earn more [from aquaculture]â(32). Furthermore, nets used to collect the shrimp larvae to supply the ponds are perceived almost universally to have led to a decrease in fish stocks due to the by-catch. These nets are illegal but bans against them are not followed or well enforced. Distinct differences can be observed between areas that are dominated by brackish shrimp aquaculture and areas that are dominated by freshwater prawn that, in turn, differ from those of farmers who concentrate solely on rice cultivation. Therefore, two different systems were defined, one for dominantly brackish shrimp cultivation, another for freshwater prawn dominated areas. The systems are separated based on: (i) forms of investment and issues of land rights, (ii) impacts on the poorest, and (iii) geographic location of the areas and associated stresses. Forms of investment in, and access to, aquaculture practices differ. Expansion of brackish water shrimp aquaculture has been driven by external investors: âThe owners of those large ghers were people coming from outside the areaâ (39). Thus, benefits tend to accrue outside the area to absentee landlords. Land conflicts arise, as rice farmers adjacent to shrimp areas have no choice but to convert to shrimp due to the negative effects of saline water intrusion on the productivity of their crops (see Faruque et al. 2017). In freshwater prawn areas, external investors and absentee landlords were not mentioned. What did arise in conversation were the large debts to set up the ponds for those who own land and different prices of land inside the polder (where cultivation can occur) and outside."

None of the three pastoral groups really recovered from their many years of dispossession in their respective countries and within the Ilemi. Livestock mortality continued at a high level, as village survey in both northern Turkana and Dasanech areas indicate (Chaps. 7 and 9). Herd sizes plummeted for the vast majority of households and villages. The pastoralistsâ longstanding strategies for recovery outlined above have proven insufï¬cient for a massive proportion of the northern Turkana and Dasanech in particular, so tens of thousands of them turned to the only remaining resource systems available to themâat the Omo River and along the shores of Lake Turkana. By the 1980s, the Omo delta had expanded considerably considerably, offering new resource availability for that helped local communities cope with the effects of earlier territorial losses (see Fig. 1.2). The general patterns of migration, or relocation to the Omo River and to Lake Turkana are indicated in Fig. 4.6. Households continue to herd whatever livestock they have leftâoften by combining herds and cooperating in labor for stock camps, including in distant areas where still possible. Along the Omo River, most of the locales for flood recession agriculture are already spoken for as this large displaced population searches for possible planting land and for livestock grazing and watering locales. Well-established social and material exchange patterns between the Dasanech and Turkana, like those of nearby ethnic groups (Fig. 1.6), have altered with these settlement shifts and accompanying changes in mobility and economy (see Chap. 7 for changes in the traditionally complex strategies for household/village level herd management since the 1970s). The Omo River and Lake Turkana are central to the present day seasonal shifts in survival strategies of the Dasanech, Nyangatom and northern Turkana peoples. Their general seasonal patterns are represented in Fig. 4.7â patterns for herding, planting and ï¬shing that are conditioned by major shifts in the character of water and biological resources of the river and lake, as well as precipitation levels and other conditions in the broader region. The relatively recent major spike in livelihood dependency on the Omo River and Lake Turkana resources by transboundary residents leaves them vulnerable in the extreme to radical reduction of river and lake waters. The precipitous drop in river flow volume and shoreline retreat of the lake caused by the Gibe III dam and dam enabled irrigated agriculture spell unprecedented disaster for the regionâs indigenous population."
179,463,0.311,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 1: Water Quality, Sediments, Sediment Contaminants, Oil and Gas Seeps, Coastal Habitats, Offshore Plankton and Benthos, and Shellfish","the Mississippi River was transporting approximately 136 million metric tons (~150 million tons) of sediment per year to the Gulf of Mexico (Thorne et al. 2008). The quantity and quality of transported sediment has been affected by changes in land use and river management throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The supply of sediment from tributaries has markedly decreased due to the construction of dams and various diversions of the river and its tributaries over the years. Thorne et al. (2008) concludes that total suspended sediment loads on the lower Mississippi River have declined by approximately 80 percent (%) during the 1851â1982 time period. A comprehensive review of the distribution, sources, and fate of contaminants in the Mississippi River and its massive drainage basin (41 % of the 48 contiguous states of the United States) is beyond the scope of this summary. However general inferences about the importance of the Mississippi River as a source of sediment contaminants are considered. A summary by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 1995 assessed contaminant levels in the Mississippi River for the 1987â1992 time period (Meade 1995). Contaminant concentrations in suspended sediments and bed sediments in the Mississippi River rapidly decreased from the northern to the southern regions of the riverâs drainage basin due to dilution with uncontaminated particulate matter and suspended sediment, evaporative losses, losses due to dissolution in water, chemical and microbial breakdown, and the geographic distribution of chemical discharges. While sediment loads are large, dilution and loss during riverine transport diminish the concentrations of contaminants in suspended sediment discharged into the Gulf of Mexico (Trefry and Presley 1976a, b). Metals naturally occur in sediment so most metal concentrations in offshore sediments are similar to crustal abundances. In contrast, the highest concentrations of contaminant metals are mostly found in coastal areas in close proximity to human activities that release metals. The few exceptions in the offshore region are discussed below. While difficult to estimate, mass loadings of contaminants from Mississippi River discharges could be quite large compared with other sources (such as those in coastal areas) as the volume of sediment delivered to the Gulf of Mexico is large. However, sediment contaminant SVOC concentrations have been confirmed to be low in river-discharged sediments most likely due to dilution with uncontaminated sediments and predischarge losses. Metals naturally occur in sediments, so most river-derived sediment metal concentrations are similar to crustal abundances with little evidence of enhanced concentrations due to contamination, with a few notable exceptions."

River floods mainly occur during the wet season (monsoon), when a large volume of water is received from the upstream catchments. This typically results in 20â60 per cent inundation of Bangladesh annually (Salehin et al. 2007), although in the study area such flooding is limited by an extensive system of coastal embankments and polders. Flood risk is projected to increase over the incoming decades, given increased overall discharge projections for the Ganges and other major Himalayan rivers. For the Ganges and Brahmaputra, Lutz et al. (2014), for example, show increased run-off till mid-twenty-first century due to a combination of increased precipitation and glacier melt in the high upper catchments. Cyclones and tropical storms regularly make landfall in Bangladesh, typically more than once per year, leading to high winds, extreme sea levels and saltwater flooding (Alam and Dominey-Howes 2015; Mutahara et al. 2016). This can damage crops and properties with consequences for life and livelihoods, creating social vulnerability for the study area population. The economic and health consequences of these events are highly significant, and virtually all analyses show that the consequences for economies and societies will increase with projected climate change, with impacts falling disproportionally on poor and vulnerable populations and acting as a brake on development (Hallegatte et al. 2017). Yet interventions and governance processes can make dramatic differences to vulnerability, poverty and the trajectories of development in the delta. Improved disaster risk management, for example, through the growth of flood warnings and cyclone shelters has greatly reduced the death toll during extreme floods and cyclones compared to the large mortality in 1970 and 1991 (Shaw et al. 2013; Lumbruso et al. 2017). The aspirations of the Bangladesh government are towards economic growth and poverty alleviation, as directly articulated in their planning processes: a Bangladesh which, by 2021, will be a middle income country where poverty will be drastically reduced where, our citizens will be able to meet every basic need and where development will be on fast track, with ever-increasing rates of inclusive growth.

Except for frogfishes and batfishes, which are rarely reported as abundant or important in other regions of the GoM, the nekton of the Cuban coast, at least at the family level, is similar to that of the southern Florida and YucataÌn assemblages, with substantial contributions from coral reef and mangrove nekton assemblages (e.g., snappers, mojarras, damselfishes). Likewise, nektonic decapod crustaceans associated with shallow macroalgal beds, mangroves, and coastal lagoons included Portunidae (crabs in the genera Portunus and Callinectes) and shrimps in the family Penaeidae, with specific mention of Farfantepenaeus notialis and Litopenaeus schmitti (Ortiz and Lalana 2005). Most of these are either the same or sibling species that occur throughout the GoM (e.g., the northern white shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus and the southern white shrimp, L. schmitti are sibling species as are the northern pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum and the southern pink shrimp F. notialis). Some nekton species are restricted to narrow regional coastal reaches by their habitat requirements or physiological tolerances to variable environmental factors. For example, the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) occurs in the neotropical regions of the southern GoM, primarily from the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Shark River Estuarine, and southwest through the Veracruzan Neritic, including a large population in Cuba. Crocodiles are limited to the southern GoM largely because of a low tolerance for cold even for short periods (Kushlan and Mazotti 1989). The related American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), which can tolerate water temperatures below 8  C (46  F) for extended periods (Lance 2003) is distributed in the GoM throughout inshore coastal wetlands from south Florida north and west through the Texas Estuarine Ecoregion. Although alligators are more widely distributed within the GoM, crocodiles have a higher salinity tolerance and are more likely to be abundant in saline wetlands within their range, including mangrove habitats throughout the southern Gulf. Both species of crocodilians are top predators within the region, feeding on a diverse diet that includes other nekton (especially fishes) as well as terrestrial mammals, reptiles, and insects. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) is another nektonic reptile that is even more characteristic of tidal marshes and mangroves of the GoM than crocodilians, and is considered by some to be among the imperiled species of special regional interest (Beck et al. 2000). The distribution of terrapin subspecies within the GoM is particularly interesting because the subspecies appear to follow the distribution of Level III Ecoregions shown in Figure 6.3. Although there are seven recognized subspecies of diamondback terrapin, only four of these occur within the GoM (Ernst and Lovich 2009). M. terrapin rhizophorarum (mangrove diamondback terrapin) is restricted to mangrove habitats of the Florida Keys, Florida Bay,"
73,903,0.311,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Intertidal coastal wetlands are dynamic systems that are habitat for mangrove and saltmarsh plant communities. They deliver a wide range of ecosystem services (Perillo et al. 2009) providing a range of value and non-value uses (see Barbier et al. 2010 for a detailed review) including nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important ï¬sh species (Sheaves et al. 2014), habitat for migratory birds (Visser and Baltz 2009) and aesthetic green spaces. Coastal wetlands improve water quality by stripping nutrients and intercepting sediments, and they reduce erosion by protecting the foreshore from waves and currents (Costanza et al. 2006). In addition, mangrove and saltmarsh are amongst the most efï¬cient ecosystems in the world at sequestering carbon (Saintilan et al. 2013) and are being investigated for future Blue Carbon opportunities (e.g., Mcleod et al. 2011; Irving et al. 2011). However loss of coastal wetlands is a major concern globally (Irving et al. 2011) with urbanisation and development identiï¬ed as the most common cause of mangrove loss (Dale et al. 2014). Losses in New South Wales (NSW) Australia have been estimated at 60 % for the period from European settlement (1788) to 1970 (Goodrick 1970) with losses continuing to occur (Pressey and Middleton 1982). More recently loss of saltmarsh (Saintilan et al. 2014) has resulted in its listing as an endangered ecological community within NSW and nationally. The high conservation value of coastal wetlands is now better recognised with many protected by legislation and sometimes via land use zonings. However, even when there is protection via zoning or other means, coastal wetlands often retain legacies of past land uses that pre-date the zoning. Clearing, draining and construction of roads associated with agricultural and urban development are major contributors to loss, fragmentation and degradation of coastal wetlands (Williams and Watford 1997). In the NSW coastal zone several thousand structures that could"

36,413,0.311,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.6 Conclusion Bats harbour viruses that may become zoonotic. Circumstances facilitating spillover include direct contact with bats (bites, scratches, consumption of bats), contact with material contaminated by bat saliva, faeces or urine and amplification via intermediate hosts such as domestic animals or other wildlife species. Conservational actions are not only important to prevent spillovers, but also because emerging zoonotic viruses often lead to persecution of bats. In order to reduce the transmission risk of viruses from bats to human and livestock and to protect bat species at threat, educational efforts are needed. However, entrenched cultural and social components often act as barriers to efficient changes on how people think about and respond to bats. Whenever possible, educational efforts should be done in an informative, non-lurid way, presenting the facts rather than provoking additional fears to the already bad reputation of bats. Wherever possible, solutions should be found to enable the existence of bats in anthropogenic landscape, including the development of more affordable and readily available vaccinations (e.g. against rabies), and the reduction of potential contact between bats and humans and livestock. This however also includes that the natural habitats of bats need to be better protected to provide bat populations with sufficient space and to prevent range expansion into urban and suburban areas, where contact with humans and livestock may increase the risk of spillover events. Bat-borne viruses should be considered during bat conservation efforts, and it should be equally noticed that appropriate conservation measures may even reduce the risk of viral spillover from bat populations into human populations."

That decision, as other extreme applications of Goodness, would have unacceptable consequences. No Harm tells us, however, that when we see the occasional jaywalker ethics should drive us to compassion. To avoid harming her, we push the brake pedal. The supreme form of harm is killing. Many stern moralists of the past had no qualms about condoning some cases of killing. It should be a cornerstone of any modern system of ethics that killing stands apart from all other disapproved forms of behavior. Any acceptance of killing humans after birth should be restricted by the most stringent and exceptional conditions. This rule, the Principle of Life, is another quasi-absolute corollary of the Principle of Goodness: before all, preserve human life. The Principle of Life explains, for example, that while we think regrettable to separate a child from his teacher we recoil with horror at the idea of separating him from his parents. The reason is that life is the most important of all human goals, and harming peopleâs life, especially the life of the weak, is the worst possible kind of harm."

They studied Tettigoniidae (bush crickets) at railway edges in an urban context (Penone et al. 2012), and found that species richness and abundance was explained by a quadratic effect of train speed (described by a humpbacked curve). This is especially true of mobile species at larger scales than on sedentary species. However, vegetated railway verges had a signiï¬cant positive effect on most species, suggesting that suitable habitats with appropriate management can overcome the negative effects of disturbance on larger scales (Penone et al. 2012)."
291,65,0.31,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"6.2 Results Figures 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, and 6.21 (pages 46â65) depict Lexis diagrams of rates of mortality improvements (âROMIsâ), which are the time derivative of age-specific death rates. We argue that those maps are better able to illustrate mortality dynamics than the commonly used âheat mapsâ of mortality. We plotted our first ROMIs on the Lexis surface about 10 years ago (Rau et al. 2008). In the meantime, those plots have become more commonplace, especially among actuaries, to visualize mortality dynamics. Our method can be considered as a descriptive tool. It is able to detect the predominant dynamics of mortality (or of any other phenomenon measured on the Lexis surface). We think that those âROMIâ-maps provide better insights into mortality dynamics than standard surface maps but are equally intuitively understandable. During the 1950s, the first years of our observation period, survival improved tremendously especially for infants, children, and young adults. The most remarkable declines in mortality were recorded for Japanese females (Fig. 6.14, page 58). After the end of World War II, life expectancy in Japan was below the average of western European countries. According to data from the Human Mortality Database, life expectancy for Japanese females rose from 60.9 years in 1950 to 72.3 in 1963. Thus, life expectancy increased by almost 1 year within each calendar year during that time span! But also France (Fig. 6.9, p. 53), Italy (Fig. 6.13, p. 57), England & Wales (Fig. 6.7, p. 51) or the United States (Fig. 6.21, p. 65), to name only a few, gained several years of life due to mortality declines at younger ages."

This describes the negative values of ecosystems such as diseases, parasites, predators, or certain insects that are often overlooked in valuation attempts of ES (Dunn 2010). In the context of river landscape management, the ecosystem disservice âï¬oodingâ is of speciï¬c importance. While ï¬ooding also provides valuable services, such as supporting ï¬sh nurseries in the ï¬oodplain or storing water in the ï¬oodplain and the aquifer, especially in areas where people settled or built too close to water bodies or in previous ï¬oodplains, ï¬ood events are considered as âbadsâ (Nedkov and Burkhard 2012). However, there is often little awareness of the fact that many of these disservices are actually caused by human activities in the ï¬rst place. Although the ES concept is highly popular in the scientiï¬c realm and is discussed in countless research articles and policy papers, its application in practice lags behind (Portman 2013; Hauck et al. 2013; Albert et al. 2014). One reason for this researchpractice gap is seen in the lack of any guidance for policy-makers to deï¬ne, measure, and value ES and to integrate them in policy and governance (Bouma and van Beukering 2015). This points to the need for more direct science-policy interaction between researchers and stakeholders and a better communication to stakeholders and the public (NeÃhÃ¶ver et al. 2013; de Groot et al. 2010).

321,75,0.31,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"Next let us consider the second paradigmââThe Limited Earth.â The problems caused by the fact that the Earth is limited are far-reaching. These include not only energy, resources, global warming, air pollution, water pollution, ground pollution, food, and water, but alsoâif we think broadlyâsuch problems as the widescale spread of infectious diseases of people and livestock. The reason is that the probability of virus mutation and transmission increases along with the probability that wild animals come into contact with livestock, livestock with other livestock, humans with livestock, and so on. And in turn, the probability of contact on the limited surface of the Earth increases in proportion to the square of the population density. âVision 2050â has been proposed as a solution to three of these issues, namely energy, resources, and global warming. These three problems are deeply interrelated, with each problem and response coupled to the others. Therefore these three issues must be solved at the same time. That solution is âVision 2050,â a model that the world should aim for in order to solve these problems confronting humanity. Of course, âVision 2050â does not include other problems facing our world, such as terrorism, political conflict, or eradication of poverty. While it does narrow down the focus to the material foundations of the overarching picture, in order to solve these three problems, it is a vision that gives structure to and integrates fragmented and scattered knowledge, thereby providing a whole picture of these issues."

231,172,0.31,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"There are over 200 species of ï¬sh in the North Sea and their total annual productivity has been estimated at 1.8 g C mâ2 (Daan et al. 1990). Cushing (1984) reported a large increase in the abundance of gadoids such as whiting Merlangius merlangus, haddock Melanogrammus aegleï¬nus, cod Gadus morhua and Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii accompanied by a decrease in herring Clupea harengus in the 1960s, commonly referred to as the âgadoid outburstâ. Overall, demersal ï¬sh and their size composition have declined in the North Sea since the start of the 20th century (Pope and Macer 1996). The commercial ï¬shery was heavily exploited in the 1960s, when landings peaked and then declined following a ban on herring in 1977 from a change in EU ï¬sheries policy. The ï¬shery reopened in 1981 and landings increased until 1988 followed by a record low in the 1990s. Of the roughly 10 million t of ï¬sh and shellï¬sh biomass produced each year in the North Sea, around 25 % is removed by the ï¬shery, 50 % is consumed by predatory ï¬sh species, and the rest is consumed by birds and mammals or lost to disease (Daan et al. 1990). About 2.3 million t of ï¬sh and shellï¬sh were landed in the North Sea in 1999 (FAO 2003). Fish catches over the past 60 years seem strongly related to levels of primary production (Chassot et al. 2010). Pelagic species such as herring and mackerel are the most important in landings, as well as smaller species such as sardines, and anchovy. Demersal landings include cod, haddock, whiting, saithe Pollachius virens, plaice and sole. Detailed statistics of ï¬sh landings are available from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES 2008; FAO Annual reports; see also Chaps. 8 and 12). The sedimentary environment of the North Sea contains up to 5000 species of macrobenthic and meiobenthic invertebrates (Heip and Craeymeersch 1995). Total macrobenthic biomass decreases northward from 51.5Â°N while biodiversity and density increase (Heip et al. 1992). Rehm and Rachor (2007) also showed benthic biomass to decrease with distance from the coast. According to Heip and Craeymeersch (1995), northern species of the macrobenthic community extend southward to the northern slope of Dogger Bank and southern species extend northward to the 100 m depth contour. They also found the separation between northern and southern species to disappear at around the 70 m depth contour in the central North Sea."
255,136,0.309,Railway Ecology,"concerns, railways. The ï¬rst mechanism arises directly from trading activities, where the traded commodity may itself be the non-native species. In these cases, the âimportationâ of the species is deliberate, because some of its attributes are desired in the area of destination. The reasons behind the importation of species are varied, and include farming, forestry, livestock, ornamental plants and pets, laboratory testing or biocontrol. In some situations, the goal is purposely the formation of wild populations, as is the case of gaming and ï¬shing or biocontrol agents. In other cases, the imported species are to be stored in enclosed environments, but they often escape from captivity. For instance, the American mink (Neovison vison) has invaded many European countries due to accidental escape or deliberate release from fur farms (Vidal-Figueroa and Delibes 1987; Bonesi and Palazon 2007). It is worrisome that a great number of problematic invaders is still actively marketed today, including freshwater macroinvertebrates and ï¬sh (Capinha et al. 2013; Consuegra et al. 2011) and plants (Humair et al. 2015). Trading activities may also lead to the arrival of non-native species as an accidental âby-productâ of a commodity, such as a commensal, a parasite or a disease. These species can remain undetected for long periods of time and may beneï¬t from measures towards the establishment to their hosts in the wild. An illustrative example of such by-products of a traded commodity is the crayï¬sh plague (Aphanomyces astaci) in Europe. This fungus-like disease is hosted by several North American crayï¬sh species that were introduced in European wetlands in order to boost the wild stocks of this food item. However, unlike for North American species that co-evolved with the disease, the crayï¬sh plague is deadly to European species and has already caused numerous extinctions of local populations (Capinha et al. 2013). Stowaway species can be associated with trading activities or any other activity that involves a transportation vehicle. In other words, a non-native stowaway species is not speciï¬c to a particular commodity, and it can be any organism that at some point is displaced by a vehicle or its load. This occurs more often with species that are difï¬cult to detect, such as those that are small or stealthy. Known examples of these stowaway species include land snails attached to trains or their cargo (PeltanovÃ¡ et al. 2011), plankton in shipâs ballast waters (Hulme et al. 2008), or seeds in soil attached to automobiles (Hodkinson and Thompson 1997). Centers of human and commodity transportation and nearby areas (e.g. seaports and railroad stations and yards) often provide the ï¬rst records of non-native stowaways (e.g. Noma et al. 2010) and can host diverse communities of invasive species (Drake and Lodge 2004). Finally, transport infrastructures may also act as âcorridorsâ for the natural dispersal of non-native biodiversity. These infrastructures facilitate the dispersal of non-native organisms by allowing their movement across physical and environmental barriers (e.g. a mountain range now crossed by a tunnel), or by supplying suitable habitat for expanding invasive populations. Concerning the latter case, a few characteristics of the areas managed by transportation companies (e.g. road and railway verges) are considered beneï¬cial to the establishment of non-native species, particularly the regular occurrence of disturbance that gives rise to âvacantâ niches"
36,118,0.309,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Recent studies provide evidence for widespread scale dependence in associations between landscape metrics and bat responses at the assemblage, population, ensemble, and species levels (Gorresen and Willig 2004; Meyer and Kalko 2008a; Pinto and Keitt 2008; Klingbeil and Willig 2009, 2010; Henry et al. 2010; Cisneros et al. 2015). Pinto and Keitt (2008) quantified forest cover at a range of scales (buffers with radii from 50 to 2000 m) and found positive associations with bat abundance, whereby the scale that elicited the strongest response was species specific. Differential species responses to forest cover in this case were best explained by interspecific variation in diet, body size, and home range size. Similarly, multiple species- and ensemble-specific abundance responses of phyllostomid bats to landscape characteristics at multiple focal scales (buffers with 1, 3, and 5 km radii) have been reported from moderately fragmented, lowland Amazonian forest (Klingbeil and Willig 2009) and highly fragmented Atlantic forest in Paraguay (Gorresen and Willig 2004). In both studies, species were demonstrated to interact with their environment simultaneously at a range of spatial scales. In the Amazon, a change in the focal scale of response occurred between dry and wet seasons, a finding which is likely linked to seasonal differences in food abundance and diversity as well as energetic constraints associated with reproduction (Klingbeil and Willig 2010; Cisneros et al. 2015). Scale dependence in response patterns has also been observed in landscapes with an aquatic matrix (Meyer and Kalko 2008a; Henry et al. 2010), suggesting that scale effects are ubiquitous and operate in fragmented landscapes across a broad range of matrix types. Overall, such findings emphasize that multiscale approaches to determining the effects of landscape structure on tropical bats are essential. In agreement with recent findings for tropical birds (Banks-Leite et al. 2013), the available evidence suggests, however, that the extremely idiosyncratic responses of tropical bats to landscape structure make it difficult to identify any particular landscape predictor or spatial scale that performs best at predicting responses at the assemblage level. Despite the general importance of a landscape-level perspective in the study of habitat fragmentation, patch characteristics remain important for patch-dependent species (Driscoll et al. 2013). However, fragmentation studies on tropical bats that have jointly assessed the relative contribution of patch- and landscape-scale variables for explaining response patterns are scarce. Meyer and Kalko (2008a) found that the relative importance of local- versus landscape-scale characteristics in explaining species richness and compositional patterns of phyllostomids on Panamanian land-bridge islands varied with spatial scale. At the patch scale, isolation distance from the mainland was the strongest predictor, whereas the proportion of forest cover in the surrounding landscape was the most prominent descriptor explaining variation in assemblage attributes at larger scales. Although the importance of spatial scale and spatial variation in matrix quality have received some attention in the bat fragmentation literature, we know little about how species responses to fragmentation vary over time or how they are mediated by changes to the matrix. Across many human-modified landscapes in the tropics, secondary forest regrowth may reclaim once deforested"

However, these findings clearly demonstrate that the economic impact of marine litter on coastal communities can be extremely high. McIlgorm et al.

(2010), they consisted of such losses as those from entangled ship propellers, lost fishing time, and tourism losses from deterring visitors, but not the cost of any harm to ecosystem services or other non-market values (McIlgorm et al. 2011). In total, McIlgorm et al. (2011) estimated the cost of marine litter in the Asia-Pacific region to be in the region of â¬1 billion per year to marine industries, equivalent to 0.3 % of the gross domestic product for the marine sector of the region."

35,275,0.309,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"How attitudes to aquaculture vary and correspond between social groups must be taken into account by planning authorities. However, capturing these varying stakeholder attitudes are also of relevance for businesses, NGOs and other stakeholders (Mazur and Curtis 2008; Freeman et al. 2012; Ladenburg and Krause 2011). Studies from different countries have explored groupsâ views on how aquaculture impacts, i.e. on the environment (e.g. by chemical pollution, effecting local ï¬sh stocks and wildlife, visual pollution of coastal landscape), on possible job-creation and economic beneï¬ts of mostly rural marginal areas, how it interferes with tourism, ï¬shing or recreation, how it contributes to food security, and how the regulation of aquaculture should be. This has been done for a number of countries, including Australia (Mazur and Curtis 2006, 2008), Spain (Bacher et al. 2014), Thailand (Schmitt and Brugere 2013), US and Norway (Chu et al. 2010), Greece (Katranidis et al. 2003), New Zealand (Shafer et al. 2010), Germany (Krause et al. 2011; Wever et al. 2015), Israel (Freeman et al. 2012), and Scotland (Whitmarsh and Palmieri 2009). Many of the studies concentrate on local stakeholder groups related to aquaculture (e.g. Bacher et al. 2014), several include tourists (e.g. Katranidis et al. 2003), some consider the general public (e.g. Mazur and Curtis 2008), and some also try to consider how the attitudes and risk perceptions expressed correlate with personal characteristics (e.g. lifestyle behaviour, Freeman et al. 2012), or even with community situation (e.g. employment or income deprivation, Whitmarsh and Palmieri 2009). Bergfjord (2009) asked ï¬sh farmers in Norway what they see as the greatest risks to their business. The majority of respondents raised biggest concerns pertaining to market conditions for their product and towards the outbreak of diseases. Socially related dimensions do, however, also appear on their list, including sea area access, changes to the license system and of environmental regulations, which are all relatively high up on the list, while public repugnance to ï¬sh farms (aesthetics, environment) is ranked lower. Slater et al. (2013), investigate how personal characteristics correlate with willingness towards choosing aquaculture as a livelihood in a developing country setting. Their model allows policy makers to consider the influence of socio-economic factors on the success of introducing aquaculture in different local contexts."

230,674,0.309,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"15.4 Potential Gaps in Marine Litter Management As previously described, a basic regulatory and management framework addressing marine litter is in place and a number of regions and countries have taken management measures to tackle the issues. A few cases indicate that some of the management measures have generated desirable results, such as South Koreaâs fishing gear buyback programme, Taiwanâs plastic restriction policy and compulsory garbage sorting policy, US Fish for Energy, OSPAR Fishing for Litter, EU PRF Directive, HELCOM Baltic Strategy (see previous sections). Despite this, marine litter continues to increase worldwide: on shorelines, in estuaries and mangroves, in oceanic gyres, and on seafloors, signalling that marine litter remains an abiding problem, particularly with respect to microplastics (Barnes et al. 2009; UNEP 2011; Lima et al. 2014; Mohamed Nor and Obbard 2014; Pham et al. 2014; Lusher 2015). There are complex reasons for this and, it is possible to identify a number of gaps in the current framework that prevent the effective control of marine litter. â¢ Limits of existing instruments in addressing plastic marine litter Gold et al. (2013) identified a number of limitations in existing international instruments in addressing marine litter, including their insufficient scope with respect to the main sources of plastic pollution, exemptions and lack of enforcement standards. For instance, UNCLOS acknowledges the existence of landbased sources but simply requests that countries address the problem through domestic means.44 MARPOL Annex V exempts accidental loss of disposal of plastic resulting from damage to the ship or its equipment,45 as well as ships <400 GT, a category to which most of the fishing vessels belong, from recoding garbage discharge operations in Garbage Record Books (GRBs).46 However, GRBs are of utmost importance to ensure compliance with discharge regulations (HELCOM 2012). The lack of enforcement standards can be found in the terms used in the legal instruments. UNCLOS, for instance, requires only that nations âshall endeavorâ to use the âbest practical meansâ to reduce marine pollution âin accordanceâ with their capabilities. Similarly, the Helsinki Convention requires contracting parties to take âall appropriateâ measures to prevent and eliminate pollution. This leaves room for interpretation for countries with differing legal systems, environmental circumstances and capacities (Gold et al. 2013). â¢ Deficiencies in the legislation and a lack of implementation and enforcement of regulations and management measures The implementation and enforcement of regulations and management measures at national levels is a key component to combat marine litter. However, a number"

73,901,0.309,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Population growth in Australia is concentrated in the coastal zone, and especially along the south east of the continent (ABS 2014) where enjoyment of the coastal environment is a strong attraction for many people. Growth pressure has produced increasingly rapid coastal zone development and has been termed the âsea changeâ phenomenon (Gurran et al. 2006). However, the geography of the coastal zone, including rivers, wetlands and ï¬oodplains, is a constraint on urban development that has led to peri-urban development close to the coast. Coastal peri-urban areas are a temporal and spatial mosaic of agricultural land and open spaces being gradually converted to housing with some natural areas being retained for green space. In this chapter we take a multidisciplinary approach to examining planning issues for coastal development in peri-urban areas. Initially we look at coastal wetlands, and the incumbent mosquito hazard, in the context of ecosystem service. The issue of mosquito production receives little consideration in planning even though mosquito borne diseases and mosquito control incur considerable cost for individuals and government. We also consider the legacy of past impacts on coastal wetlands and issues around rehabilitation that are rarely incorporated into planning, though the impacted wetland can be a constraint for development and future residents. Through two case studies, a âgreenï¬eldâ and a âretroï¬tâ development, we explore some options to address these impacts on coastal wetlands. Greenï¬eld developments often involve the subdivision of agricultural or open space land and the provision of urban infrastructure such as roads, green space and other services. Retroï¬t developments occur at already developed sites and involve modifying infrastructure to minimise unintended environmental impact, for example, incorporating water sensitive urban design features into an existing stormwater network. Replacement, technological improvement or additional information can be retroï¬t triggers. Retroï¬t works are often costly, involving design and outcome compromises because of constraints imposed by the existing infrastructure setting. Consequently, there is little commercial incentive to undertake retroï¬t works which are therefore generally undertaken by public authorities often in response to regulatory risk. By contrast greenï¬eld developments are generally undertaken for commercial proï¬t. Both development types can require approvals from relevant authorities."

302,273,0.309,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"However, the feeding type is not a reliable predictor of MP ingestion as several studies on pelagic zooplankton communities highlight a far more complex MP-biota interaction than currently understood. Overall, the feeding on particulate matter is a sequential process involving the encounter, pursuit, capture, and ingestion of potential prey [30]. Every single stage is determined by species-specific abilities and preferences to distinguish between favored and non-favored food sources (e.g., size, shape, taste, motile, sessile). Additionally, many taxa can adapt their feeding habits (e.g., targeting a preferred size class and/or nutritional value) in response to environmental conditions (optimal foraging). In general, it appears that the capability to directly ingest MPs decreases with an increasing selectivity in feeding (Fig. 1b). Generalist filter feeders will actively and directly ingest MPs from the water column or sediments in the size range of their typical food, whereas more specialized feeders (e.g., fluid feeders, raptorial carnivorous feeders) will indirectly ingest MPs associated with their prey. The variety of feeding types and degrees of selective feeding present in aquatic fauna complicates generalizing patterns of MP uptake. This is especially true when comparing experimental to the real exposure scenarios. In the laboratory, virgin spherical microbeads are used, whereas in the environment, irregularly shaped MPs are colonized by microbes (see Sect. 3.2), adsorb extracellular proteins (biofilm), and form hetero-aggregates (increasing size). While MP-biota interactions are hard to predict based on the currently available data, feeding selectivity may be a driving factor (see Fig. 1b for a conceptual model)."

Before 2010, Haiti had not experienced cholera for at least a century. Haiti, a country of ten million people, occupies the western portion of the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean. Although its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is about $1,200 (Central Intelligence Agency 2012),13 a tiny elite controls most of the countryâs wealth. With 80 % of the population living below the poverty line, Haiti is the lowest-ranked country in the Americas on the United Nations (U.N.) Human Development Index (UNDP 2011). The economy depends heavily on remittances from Haitians working abroad and on foreign aid. Life expectancy in Haiti is 62 years, while infant mortality is 52 per 1,000 live births (UNDP 2011). Sixty-four percent of Haitians have access to an improved water source (i.e., one that is protected from outside contamination), but just 26 % have access to improved sanitation (i.e., a facility that separates human excreta from human contact) (WHO/UNICEF 2013). Communicable diseases, including HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, and malaria remain substantial causes of disability and death. There are severe shortages of physicians, nurses, hospital beds, and essential medicines. About 6 % of GDP is spent on health, of which threequarters is private expenditure. Out-of-pocket spending on health care is extremely high (UNDP 2011). Haiti has a long history of political instability, characterized by multiple coups, foreign interference and occupation, and extended periods of dictatorship, notably under FranÃ§ois Duvalier (Papa Doc) and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier (Baby Doc) between 1957 and 1986. Following a coup in 2004, the U.N. stationed peacekeepers in Haiti. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has been in Haiti ever since. In January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti. Hundreds of thousands of people died and up to a million were left homeless. International aid agencies, donor governments, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) mobilized rapidly in response, and substantial amounts of money and aid were promised to assist in rebuilding."
182,98,0.308,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"This chapter has provided an overview of the health and medicine of the animals that inhabited Britainâs zoos during the mid- to late nineteenth century. Contrary to existing historical accounts, which claim that animal health was neglected in this period and that few medical interventions took place, it reveals wide-ranging, ongoing attempts by medical men to understand, prevent and treat animal disease. By turning the spotlight onto these interventions, the circumstances that gave rise to them, and their implications for participating humans and animals, it offers new perspectives on the interlinked histories of zoos, animals and medicine. We have seen how zoos impacted on, and were moulded by, the health experiences of their animal inhabitants. Methods of animal housing, feeding and management precipitated ailments such as rickets, tuberculosis and digestive upsets, which caused much animal suffering and frequently death. To the zoological societies, these events threatened the zoosâ finances and its scientific activities, while to certain external medical men, they offered prospects of scientific and career advancement. The unanticipated occurrence of these diseases prompted the medicalization of zoosâtheir transformation into sites for medical"

302,369,0.308,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Abstract The diagnosis that we are living in a world risk society formulated by Ulrich Beck 20 years ago (Beck, Kâ¬ olner Z Soziol Sozialpsychol 36:119â147, 1996) has lost nothing of its power, especially against the background of the Anthropocene debate. âGlobal risksâ have been identified which are caused by human activities, technology, and modernization processes. Microplastics are a by-product of exactly these modernization processes, being distributed globally by physical processes like ocean currents, and causing effects far from their place of origin. In recent years, the topic has gained great prominence, as microplastics have been discovered nearly everywhere in the environment, raising questions about the impacts on food for human consumption. But are microplastics really a new phenomenon or rather a symptom of an old problem? And exactly what risks are involved? It seems that the phenomenon has accelerated political actionâthe USA has passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015âand industries have pledged to fade out the use of microbeads in their cosmetic products. At first sight, is it a success for environmentalists and the protection of our planet? This chapter deals with these questions by adopting a social-ecological perspective, discussing microplastics as a global risk. Taking four main characteristics of global risks, we develop four arguments to discuss (a) the everyday production of risk by societies, (b) scientific risk evaluation of microplastics, (c) social responses, and (d) problems of risk management. To illustrate these four issues, we draw on different aspects of the current scientific and public debate. In doing so, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the social-ecological implications of microplastics."

For example, HELCOM and OSPAR (2003) define EAM in the marine environment as: [â¦.] the comprehensive integrated management of human activities based on the best available scientific knowledge about the ecosystem and its dynamics, in order to identify and take action on influences which are critical to the health of marine ecosystems, thereby achieving sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services and maintenance of ecosystem integrity.

337,328,0.307,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"example of a scenario that Samburu residents asked us to include, given their interest in intensifying their livestock management. A program is in place now, led by C. Lesorogol, to introduce enhanced and highly productive goat breeds into Siambu. In a scenario, attributes of goats are modified to represent mixed herds of local and enhanced breeds, and effects on livelihoods judged (6). Residents asked us to explore the implications of improved crop yields on livelihoods (7). This scenario addresses a variety of management options, streamlined so as to be amenable to simulation with our tools. For example, land owners struggle to decide whether increased production from high-yield seed stocks outweigh their increased costs, whether to invest in chemical fertilizers (very few do in the region), investing in water projects for irrigation, and the usefulness versus costs of drought tolerant seeds. The last scenario (8) compares the costs and benefits of increasing or decreasing veterinary care for livestock. Residents seek to balance the money they spend on veterinary care with the benefits they receive through improved livestock health and survival. We used an application of SAVANNA and DECUMA to Mbaringon to address this scenario. These preliminary results report outcomes from three simulations (baseline, increased livestock survival by 3 %, decreased by 3 %); in practice we do 20 or more simulations of each type to yield error estimates. Such a seemingly small change in survival for large herbivores can have dramatic impacts on population dynamics. In this example, Fig. 9.2 (top) shows about a 1 tropical livestock unit (TLUs) increase for each adult equivalent (AE). These metrics are methods of standardizing livestock of different species (e.g., a cattle is 1 TLU, and a sheep or goat is 0.1 TLU) and humans of different ages and sexes (e.g., an adult male is 1 AE, and a child 6â12 years old is 0.85 AE) (Boone et al. 2011). Figure 9.2 (bottom) demonstrates one of the many linkages within the SAVANNA-DECUMA integrated system. The average proportion of householdsâ diets composed of supplemental food decreases when more funds are spent on veterinary care. This must be weighed against the costs of the improved care."

From the 1989 high of almost 190,000 days fished, fishing effort had a fluctuating decrease to a low of 85,000 days fished in 1996, then a fluctuating increase to 130,000 days fished in 2001 when effort began declining again. Effort declined to a low of 73,000 days fished in 2008 and then had a slight increase in 2009 to 84,000 days (Nance 2011)."

Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable. This is due to various factors: x Production often in more exposed areas, e.g. disadvantaged and mountain regions, marginal land; x Shortage or lack of financial means to invest in risk-reducing measures, e.g. irrigation, drainage, frost prevention; x Limited access to loans; x Limited access to inputs to improve production techniques, which might have risk-reducing effects. The livestock sector is more exposed to epizootic diseases than to climatic risks. There is a high risk of epizootic disease outbreaks being spread over a wide area and consequently causing high economic losses. Prominent examples of such outbreaks are foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the United Kingdom in 20018 and in South Korea in 2010â2011,9 as well as avian influenza in Asia since 2003.10 Though such large loss events have relatively long recurrence periods, the loss potential is huge. In many developing economies,11 farmers retain the risk of crop losses and epizootic diseases irrespective of the size of their farms. Their risk management mainly consists of diversifying their income sources by planting a variety of crops and breeding cattle. They have hardly any risk-transfer tools, which in turn limits the availability and range of agricultural production finance offered by banks. This situation has not changed with the development of microfinance and microinsurance12 over the last decade. Thus, neither microfinance nor microinsurance have made their way into the area of agricultural production. Although"

253,997,0.306,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","in many cases, individual loss is not fully compensable, most strikingly when that loss involves death: Whatever her actual detriment, a person who dies cannot be âmade whole.â And indeed, more than 30,000 people lose their lives on US roadways every year while more than 300 million obtain some direct or indirect beneï¬t from motorized transport. The promise that vehicle automation holds for highway safety raises difï¬cult questions about regulationâs social and individual objectives. Analyzing either objective requires topical and temporal deï¬nition of a manageable system in which costs and beneï¬ts can be identiï¬ed, valued, and compared. With respect to net social good, what is the statistical value of a human life? Is a reduction in organ donations a âcostâ of safer highways? Could aggressive deployment of particular technologies cause a backlash that ultimately undermines safety? Similarly, with respect to individual loss, how should injury or death be valued? Should culpability affect compensation? Who is entitled to it? The particular answers to these questions may depend on the domainâlaw, economics, ethics, the social sciencesâfrom which they are drawn. Vehicle automation exposes tension between the social and individual objectives. Externalities frequently accompany innovation: Inventors impose costs that they need not or cannot bear and create beneï¬ts that they cannot capture. Compensation of incidental injury may be one such cost, and socially desirable innovations like automation might be subsidized by shielding them from it. Calibrating net social good and individual loss can also create moral hazard: Safety might be discounted by innovators who are legally or effectively exempt from rules and immunized from lawsuits or by consumers who are assured of compensation for injury. This tension exists against two related background conditions. The ï¬rst is a preference for the status quoâa tendency that is reflected in administrative law, in tort law, and internationally in the precautionary principle. Many vehicle fatalities appear only in local obituaries, but a single automated vehicle fatality would end up on national front pages. The second is a failure by imperfectly probabilistic humans to accurately perceive risk. Drivers who speed around blind corners but fear traveling over bridges demonstrate this tendency to underestimate some risks and overestimate others. This complex regulatory context leads to two fundamental questions: How should risk be allocated in the face of signiï¬cant uncertaintyâand who should decide? The range of actors includes the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of national and subnational governments, companies, standards organizations, consumers, and the public at large. Regulation can be prospective or retrospective, but it cannot be nonexistent: Administrative agencies that decline to establish safety requirements for automated vehicles merely leave this task to judges and juries after incidents have occurred. The consequences of action or inaction are as stark as they are uncertain. Regulatory acts or omissions could cost lives in the near term by delaying or raising the price of automation technologies [1]. But they could also save lives in the longer term by protecting broad classes of innovation from the potential reputational damage that early tragedies or controversies could inflict.

214,274,0.306,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Climate observations and climate projections provide a background for discussion. Essential in the application was evaluation of local weather processes and whether or not models represented these processes. This helped to develop trust of the expert guidance to interpret model information. Attention is naturally drawn to recent extreme events and whether or not these extremes are consistent with projections, for example, more precipitation occurring in extreme events. Warm and dry spells in the winter and spring that alter greening of forests, followed by damaging cold, is another example. Convolution of climate, extreme events, and ecological responses sit at the foundation of plausible futures. For example, if there is large-scale disruption offorests by drought, ï¬re, or wind that leads to the death of many trees, then the future forest will be recovering in a much different mean climate than in which it originally evolved. Since Isle Royaleâs forests are at the southern extent of the subarctic (or boreal) forest, and that extent may well move northward in a warmer climate, it is unlikely that a boreal forest disrupted by drought, ï¬re, or wind will be regenerated. Given the importance of speciï¬c tree species to moose food supply, this would be a negative indicator for moose populations. Evaluation of the combined influence of climate drivers was largely negative for maintaining the wolf-moose ecosystem. Though climate change is only part of the portfolio of factors in the decision-making package, it demonstrates that in the future it will be even more difï¬cult to sustain this precarious ecosystem. A driving conclusion from this exercise is the need to plan for best possible futures rather than manage toward preservation or conservation of the past."
36,632,0.306,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"14.1.2 Relevant Natural History Features of Synanthropic Along the fastâslow continuum of life, bats are considered to be in the slow lane, even though most other mammals of similar size are in the fast lane (Barclay and Harder 2003; Bielby et al. 2007). Bats have low reproductive rates that are associated with exceptionally long life spans, a feature most obvious in insectivorous bats from temperate zones (Wilkinson and South 2002; Munshi-South and Wilkinson 2010). Long life spans may predispose bats to inhabit relatively permanent structures, such as in buildings, since some bat species are loyal to their roost over many years and form long-term social relationships with other colony members (Kerth et al. 2011). Similar to other small mammals, bats exhibit relatively high mass-specific metabolic rates (McNab 2002). Many bats are also heterothermic, reducing their body temperature and consequently metabolic rate, during periods of adverse conditions, such as low resource abundance (insects, fruits, or nectar), low ambient temperature, or high rainfall (Geiser 2004). Most notably, temperate zone bats employ extended torpor when they hibernate in winter. Apart from hibernation, almost all bats use torpor on a daily basis as an energy-saving strategy (Speakman and Thomas 2003; Willis et al. 2006). During daytime torpor, bats may use passive rewarming when ambient temperatures peak during the warmest part of the day (Turbill et al. 2003). The use of radiant heat created by the exposure of building exteriors to sunshine likely saves synanthropic bats significant amounts of energy since they do not depend on endogenous heat production in brown adipose tissue (Geiser and Drury 2003). This could be a selective advantage for bats using sun-exposed buildings instead of dark caves as daytime roosts or hibernacula (Lausen and Barclay 2006; Halsall et al. 2012)."

This highly diverse marine vegetated ecosystem consists of mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and marshes (Griffith et al. 2002) (Figure 6.80). Seagrass habitat has been cited as the largest in the northern hemisphere and is dominated by species such as Thalassia testudinum (turtlegrass), Halodule wrightii (shoalweed), and Syringodium filiforme (manatee grass) (Yarbro and Carlson 2011). Mangroves that dominate intertidal wetlands in the region consist of four primary tree species: Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove), Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove), and Conocarpus erectus (buttonwood). The southwestern Florida coast is characterized by a subtropical climate, modulated by the Gulf Stream, cold fronts, and hurricanes. The Ten Thousand Islands area north of Florida Bay to Marco Island is characterized by numerous mangrove-covered islands (Figures 6.80 and 6.81). Beaches generally are absent along the southwestern coast with only a few local accumulations of shell and skeletal debris (Davis 2011b). The coast is quite stable due to an abundance of mangrove vegetation. Although hurricanes are common in this area, their impact has had little influence on coastal geomorphology (Davis 1995). Ecosystem changes for the Southern Coast and Islands ecoregion have been documented using core data and information on historical hydrologic changes in the Everglades. Willard et al. (2001) and Wingard et al. (2007) documented long-term increases in salinity in Florida Bay and the Ten Thousand Islands area due to a combination of sea-level rise and hydrologic changes in the Everglades. These hydrologic changes produced a shift in wetland habitat from brackish/fresh-water marshes to dwarf mangrove stands. Although historical shoreline/wetland changes are primarily related to storm events and human activities (Section 6.3.4.1), Davis (2011a) suggests minimal long-term changes may be expected due to the stability of carbonate substrate in this relatively low-energy coastal region."

Water quality is a vital characteristic that determines how societies and humans use and value aquatic environments and other associated natural resources. Coastal and offshore environments are some of the greatest natural assets in the United States, and much of their value is critically dependent upon good water quality. Coastal, shelf, and deepwater environments are subject to numerous processes, interactions, influences, and stresses, which in turn determine the quality of the water they contain. The determinants, current status, and historical trends in water quality in the northern Gulf of Mexico are reviewed in Chapter 2, which is authored by Mahlon C. Kennicutt II, Professor Emeritus of Chemical Oceanography at Texas A&M University and long-time oceanographic researcher in the Gulf of Mexico. The information reviewed in Chapter 2 was drawn from periodic summaries of national coastal condition reports prepared by various federal, state, and local agencies and programs. These summaries were reviewed, but the underlying primary data that provided the basis for the reports was not reanalyzed. The assessments involved were produced by a large number of expert government and academic scientists based on a vast amount of data and information from primary sources and the peer-reviewed literature. Within this context, the synthesized data comes from hundreds of sources including national program reports; water quality reporting at the federal, state, and local levels; locally organized monitoring programs; and the published literature. The reports and data collection programs are primarily from the 1990s to the mid-2000s, and they often utilize differing metrics, indicators, and methodologies for assessing and rating water quality. These region-wide assessments in this time period of approximately 20 years are the most relevant and up-to-date means of defining the present day status and trends in water quality in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Good water quality is a concept derived from a suite of characteristics, so there is no single definition. Two key determinants of water quality in the Gulf of Mexico are physiographic setting and human activities. Several important measures of water quality include water clarity, degree of eutrophication (excessive aquatic plant growth caused by nutrient enrichment), and chemical (petroleum and nonpetroleum pollutants) and biological (pathogens) contamination. Natural and anthropogenic effects on water quality are dynamic on many scales, and this leads to considerable variability in space and time. Impacts on water quality caused by multiple factors can be additive and/or synergistic. Thus, the cumulative effects of natural and"

36,655,0.305,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Chemical pollutants Indirect threats for synanthropic bats are numerous, yet because of their subtle nature, it is more difficult to pinpoint indirect mortality risks. Chemical pollutants are likely an indirect threat for bats roosting in buildings (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Bayat et al. 2014). Wood used in buildings is usually treated by chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons to prevent rotting caused by fungi or insects. Bats roosting in buildings are in close contact with wooden structures and thus may be exposed to chemical preservatives such as lindane, pentachlorophenol, and pyrethroids (Racey and Swift 1986; Boyd and Myhill 1988; Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Shore et al. 1990, 1991; Bennet and Thies 2007). Most often, bats do not die immediately after contact with treated wood but instead suffer sublethal effects that cause, for example, immune suppression (Corrao et al. 1985; Clark and Shore 2001). Sometimes, bats are eradicated from buildings using poisons, and these poisons continue to persist so that bats may be exposed to toxic residues for extended periods after application. Poisoning is usually a gradual process that is exacerbated in temperate bats via the accumulation of toxic compounds in fat tissue and seasonal mobilization of these compounds during migration and hibernation (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Bayat et al. 2014). Since the introduction of alternative bat-friendly chemical treatments of wood in buildings, mortality caused by chlorinated hydrocarbons has decreased markedly (Bayat et al. 2014), yet from a global perspective, the problem of slow poisoning of synanthropic bats in buildings remains an issue."

Such results highlight the benefits of buffers, with riparian areas effectively providing habitat for foraging and commuting bats in selectively logged forests where clutter levels are likely to be high. Mitigating the loss of roosting habitat in hollow-bearing trees is arguably even more important than maintaining suitable foraging habitat. Forested corridors are critical habitat elements for North American foliage-roosting bats by providing both roosting and foraging opportunities. Male Seminole bats, Lasiurus seminolus, in south-eastern loblolly pine, P. taeda, plantations chose roost trees in forested corridors within harvest exclusion zones over 60 % of the time, even though corridors represented only 11 % of the landscape area (Hein et al. 2008a). Corridors were 100 to 200 m in width and comprised largely of older-aged forests in riparian and upland slope positions. Use of forested corridors for roosting has been observed in other foliage-roosting species in south-eastern forests, with tricoloured bats, Perimyotis subflavus, selecting riparian corridors (OâKeefe et al. 2009), male evening bats, Nycticeius humeralis, choosing upland corridors of mature forest (Hein et al. 2009b), and eastern red bats, L. borealis, roosting in the vicinity of gated roads (OâKeefe et al. 2009). Greenbelts in riparian corridors, or unharvested inclusions of mature mixed-pine hardwoods â¥50 years in age, were important roosting habitats for these same species in southern oakâpine forests of Arkansas (Perry et al. 2007b; Perry and Thill 2008). Harvest exclusion areas, especially those surrounding streams, are commonly used as roosting habitat by many tree hollow roosting Australian bats such as Gouldâs long-eared bat, N. gouldi, eastern forest bat, V. pumilus, and southern forest bat, V. regulus (Lunney et al. 1988; Law and Anderson 2000; Webala et al. 2010). A range of factors will influence the pattern of roosting close to creek-lines, but a large pool of older and mature trees in a variety of decay classes is likely to be important. Riparian areas often support a different vegetation type, with rainforest being particularly common in Australia. The specialist golden-tipped bat, Kerivoula papuensis, preferentially roosts in the suspended nests of small birds within riparian rainforest and such areas are excluded from harvesting (Schulz 2000; Law and Chidel 2004). Jarrah forest in Western Australia offers one example of providing pools of mature trees using zoning. Since 2004, Fauna Habitat Zones (i.e. areas of mature forest >200 ha set 2â4 km apart within areas available for logging) have been retained for species, including bats, that rely on blocks of forest supporting mature forest attributes or characteristics (Webala et al. 2010). In some forest blocks, approximately 54 % of the total area (11,740 ha) is currently reserved from logging as conservation reserves, informal reserves (riparian buffers, diverse ecotype zones, road reserves), old-growth forest, and fauna habitat zones. Of these, about 39 % are permanently reserved, including riparian buffers, from logging in the"
73,977,0.305,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The peri-urban landscapes are continuously expanding to accommodate the communities who are migrating into diffused territories in search of a better lifestyle and mostly work in nearby townships, creating a range of competing and conï¬icting land use issues. As a result, the health of many peri-urban river systems in Australia and other parts of the world has gradually deteriorated over the last decade. Being key river users, the life cycles of aquatic species and social activities of humans are severely impacted by the deteriorating state of peri-urban river systems. In the face of competing water users and urbanisation, managing and sustaining peri-urban river systems are huge challenges. It is desirable to understand how the management of a river system evolves and the role played by government agencies, communities and other stakeholders in the sustainability of the river system. Hence, a framework to assess future management proposals for protection and remediation of the river system can be developed. There should be a multidisciplinary approach to planning for development of peri-urban areas, which can consider ecosystem services and disservices and if development is occurring at the expense of coastal wetlands. Wetlands can serve as bastion for mosquito production that affects residents and impose costs on individuals and government from both health and management perspectives. Most coastal peri-urban areas, including adjacent wetland sites, retain legacy infrastructures and landforms that degrade wetland functions and often exacerbate the mosquito hazard. Rehabilitating coastal wetlands can improve wetland function, while also reducing the mosquito hazard. Coastal wetlands are almost always overlaid with a number of different zones and ownership boundaries that increase the complexity of both mosquito management and wetland rehabilitation actions. It is recommended that land use planning frameworks incorporate a trigger for both assessment of adjacent coastal wetland ecosystem function and restoration of wetland ecological processes that includes provision for habitat based source control of mosquito hazard and coastal wetland rehabilitation. Designing sustainable urban development is a multi-dimensional and multidisciplinary challenge that can beneï¬t from next-generation modelling tools to achieve high performance outcomes and integrated assessments. An information modelling platform can be developed for assessing alternative urban development scenarios. The modelling platform can allow simulation of various transition and future scenarios at the precinct level. The platform can extract data to assist in developing and assessing the performance of different components (land use, individual buildings and infrastructure related to energy and water supply and use, waste management and transport systems). A key aspect of the development is the design of a sustainable precinct that is affordable, provides a greater level of amenity and incorporates biolink corridors and natural open spaces critical to the preservation of native biodiversity. The platform can also be used to optimise the selection and design of sustainable and resilient energy, water and waste infrastructure and its integration with existing infrastructure."

However, since WTCs do not cause human injury or death, and hence are not considered a trafï¬c safety problem, the Swedish railway network is still largely unprotected against collisions with wildlife. Except for a few railway sections in the northern region, where accidents with semi-domestic reindeer lead to expensive reimbursements, fencing has long been regarded as economically unviable for railways, and alternative measures have not been seriously tested. This attitude, however, is changing as train operators upgrade their train systems to modern light-weight multiple-unit trains. These trains are less robust than traditional single train engines and require more expensive repairs after a WTC, sometimes leading to signiï¬cant delays in railway trafï¬c. The overall socio-economic costs of WTCs in Sweden have recently been estimated at 100,000,000â150,000,000 million Euros per year (Seiler et al. 2014). This is similar to the costs estimated for wildlifevehicle collisions on roads (250,000,000 Euros per year) (Seiler and Olsson 2015), despite railways comprising less than 2% of the national road network. Thus, the number of collisions with larger wildlife, especially ungulates, per kilometer, is greater on railways than public roads. Preliminary analyses of the Swedish railway network suggest that there are at least 10 railway sections with very high WTC frequencies where fencing would be economically viable today. On most railway sections, however, fencing still may not be cost-effective. Alternative methods, such as wildlife deterrents or warning systems, need to be developed to keep animals off railways, at least when trains approach. Initial attempts with such wildlife warning systems in other studies have produced promising results (Larsson-KrÃ¥ik 2005; Werka and Wasilewski 2009; BabiÅska-Werka et al. 2015; Shimura et al. 2015). Therefore, the Swedish Transport Administration, in cooperation with Swedish Railways, Enviroplanning AB, and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, initiated a project in 2015 to develop and test methods for deterring wildlife from railways when trains approach. In this chapter, we describe the research that provided the baseline for this unique project and describe its speciï¬c settings and objectives."

230,394,0.305,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.1 Introduction With the increasing reliance on plastics as an everyday item, and rapid increase in their production and subsequent disposal, the environmental implications of plastics are a growing concern. The benefits of plastics, including their durability and resistance to degradation, inversely result in negative environmental impacts. As user-plastics are primarily âsingle useâ items they are generally disposed of within one year of production, and whilst some plastic waste is recycled, the majority ends up in land-fill. Concerns arise when plastics enter the marine environment through indiscriminate disposal and it has been estimated that up to 10 % of plastic debris produced will enter the sea (Thompson 2006). Interactions between litter and the marine environment are complex. The impacts of larger plastic debris are discussed by KÃ¼hn et al. (2015) and consequences include aesthetic, social and economic issues (Newman et al. 2015), and numerous environmental impacts on marine biota (Derraik 2002; Barnes et al. 2009). However, with an ever increasing reliance on plastic products, and as plastic production, use and disposal continue, microplastics are of increasing concern (Sutherland et al. 2010). Microplastics enter the sea from a variety of sources (Browne 2015) and distributed by oceans currents; these ubiquitous contaminants are widespread (CÃ³zar et al. 2014). The amount of microplastics in the sea will continue to rise, leading to gradual but significant accumulation in coastal and marine environments (Andrady and Neal 2009). Increasing evidence of microplastics in the sea has led to a need to understand its environmental impacts as a form of marine pollution. A recent review of marine debris research found only 10 % of publications to focus on microplastics, the majority of which were from the last decade (CBD 2012). Even though plastic is the primary constituent of marine debris, microplastics are considered under-researched due to difficulties in assessing their distribution and abundance (Doyle et al. 2011). It has only been in recent years that international, national and regional efforts were made to quantify microplastics in the sea. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC) has highlighted concerns for environmental implications of marine litter and one of the key attributes of the MSFD is to determine the ecological harm caused by microplastics and their associated chemicals (Zarfl et al. 2011). Microplastics were first described as microscopic particles in the region of 20 Âµm diameter (Thompson et al. 2004). For the purpose of this study, microplastic refers to items <5 mm in size using the criteria developed by US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Arthur et al. 2009). The small size of microplastics makes them available for interaction with marine biota in different trophic levels. By inhabiting different marine habitats, a range of organisms are vulnerable to exposure (Wright et al. 2013a). At the millimetre and micrometre scale, sorption of microplastics is dominated by bulk portioning, with effects including blockages when fibres or fragments form aggregates."

However, this expenditure does not address the underlying issue, and does not act to prevent litter from entering the marine environment in the first place. When prioritizing action and the allocation of funds, the costs of damage and clean up needs to be weighed against the cost of prevention."
246,78,0.305,Rewilding European Landscapes,"areas and many wild populations have already begun to recover, especially in the case of mammals (Enserink and Vogel 2006). In the case of birds, the literature reports significant changes in the community patterns due to abandonment, especially negative effects on populations of farmland birds with narrow habitat preferences (Sirami et al. 2008). The correlation between the number of mammal species and the percentage of projected abandoned area in a grid cell is Ï = 0.14 ( p < 0.001) whereas for bird species it is negative at Ï = â 0.15 ( p < 0.001). Thus megafauna mammal species might be in a better position to take advantage of the new resources and space made available by farmland abandonment. We did not consider here the possible spatial autocorrelation of the data because we were interested only in the spatial coincidence between abandonment and megafauna. However, some of the future abandoned areas have been affected by invasive species, fire suppression practices, and missing trophic links during thousands of years of human use (ProenÃ§a et al. 2010; Wehn et al. 2011). Thus abandonment may not be sufficient to return these areas to a vegetation close to PNV in a short term without management actions (see Chap. 8). But even in these areas the abandonment will have immediate positive effects on wildlife by reducing human disturbance, increasing landscape connectivity, and releasing ecological processes from human control and thus increasing the wilderness value of the land (see Chap. 1). Aplet et al. (2000) describe the two dimensional space defined by the axes of freedom and naturalness as a framework for wilderness management. Freedom is understood as the absence of human control over ecological processes (i.e selfwilled) while naturalness is the degree to which ecosystems are close to an accepted ecological benchmark. Such a framework is readily usable for mapping the tradeoffs related to human management in areas affected by invasive and exotic species, thus increasing naturalness but decreasing freedom (Landres et al. 2000; Sydoriak et al. 2000), but also the current views on rewilding as some advocate for serious management commitments in order to achieve a certain perception of wilderness (Donlan et al. 2006). However, we consider that the ultimate aim of rewilding is not to recreate some image of pre-human ecosystems, but to facilitate new, selfregulating systems that appear naturally out of the current conditions. A realistic expectation is that in the absence of human management, the new rewilded areas will form novel ecosystems that share elements with the pre-human past but also integrate current factors. Minimum human management and this new wilderness of natural and self-sustaining ecosystems should be the goal of rewilding."
36,381,0.305,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.1 Introduction Over the past decades, the emergence of zoonotic viruses (those that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans) from bats has been the subject of increasing attention from both scientists and the general public (e.g. Quammen 2013). During outbreaks of diseases in humans and livestock, bats are now often the primary focus of searches for a reservoir host (Chua et al. 2002a; Leroy et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Halpin et al. 2007; Towner et al. 2007; Lau et al. 2010; Wibbelt et al. 2010; Memish et al. 2013). Identification of bats as natural hosts for emerging viruses has important implications for bat conservation. We review the current state of research of four important families of emerging zoonotic viruses for which bats are natural reservoir hosts and discuss direct and indirect conservation implications."
246,102,0.305,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Ecosystem Services and Scenarios of Rewilding Here we estimate the biophysical potential of rewilding to produce benefits, by comparing ecosystem services in the top 5 % wilderness areas with the current supply of ecosystem services in all agricultural areas and in agricultural areas that are projected to be abandoned. We restrict the analysis to the scale of the Iberian Peninsula to control for the large bioclimatic variability across Europe. There are significant differences in the supply of most ecosystem services between the different land use categories (Table 3.2). HANPP values are significantly higher in agricultural areas than in both land projected to be abandoned and, as expected, in the top 5 % wilderness areas. We thus hypothesize that food production will decrease with the contraction of the agricultural area, although the decrease will be limited because of the lower agricultural productivity of those areas. Several services present higher values for the average supply of the studied indicators in the top 5 % wilderness areas (Table 3.2). The deposition velocity of NOx, an indicator of air quality, depends on the height of the vegetation and the leaf area index, and tends to be much higher in forested areas (Maes et al. 2011), hence, the higher values in the top 5 % wilderness (Table 3.2). The recreation potential is also higher in wilderness areas than in the other land-uses. Most ecosystem services exhibit higher values in the areas to be abandoned than in other agricultural areas (Fig. 3.3a). We can thus speculate that intensifying agriculture in the areas projected to be abandoned would lead to an overall decrease in the supply of ecosystem services in these areas. On the other hand, rewilding these areas would bring improvements in some ecosystem services, such as nitrogen retention and recreation, and decreases in others (Fig. 3.3b). These inferences have to be interpreted with care as we are making several simplifying assumptions and ecosystem services depend on other biophysical variables besides land cover and"

M. t. macrospilota (ornate diamondback terrapin) occurs primarily within the marshes of the Western Florida Estuarine and Eastern Gulf Neritic. M. t. pileata (Mississippi diamondback terrapin) ranges within the tidal marshes of the Mississippi Estuarine. The fourth subspecies, M. t. littoralis (Texas diamondback terrapin) occupies the Texas Estuarine from western Louisiana to Corpus Christi, Texas. The conformity between the distributions of the subspecies of diamondback terrapins and Level III Ecoregions within the GoM is matched by few other nekton. Diamondback terrapins consume a variety of estuarine invertebrates including snails, crustaceans, and bivalves. Although strong swimmers, they tend to have limited home ranges, which may help to explain how the distinct subspecies persist. Water depth, salinity, seasonal temperatures, dissolved oxygen, freshwater inputs, sediment type, availability of physical or biogenic structure (Day et al. 1989), as well as the size and spatial configuration of aquatic habitats within the coastal landscape (BostroÌm et al. 2011), are among the multiple interacting factors controlling the composition and structure of nekton assemblages within coastal wetlands. Environmental variability on multiple spatial and temporal scales is a hallmark of estuarine systems, but the high mobility of nekton allows assemblages to persist by emigrating in response to unfavorable environmental conditions that might develop over the short-term or on limited spatial scales, and quickly immigrating to repopulate the same areas when conditions improve (Hackney et al. 1976; Day et al. 1989; Tyler et al. 2009). Water depth usually affects the size of the species or life stages of nekton found in coastal wetlands. Shallow waters associated with most coastal wetlands generally are dominated by smaller (mostly <15 cm) individuals. Mean size and species richness of nekton assemblages tends to decrease from deeper to shallower waters, as does swimming ability, but densities often increase along the same depth gradient, with greater nekton densities occurring in shallow water (e.g., Peterson and Turner 1994; Eggleston et al. 2004; Ellis and Bell 2004). Within shallow vegetated habitats of the coast, the fish families Fundulidae (fundulids), Cyprinodontidae (killifishes), and Poecilidae (live-bearers) are abundantly represented (e.g., Rozas 1993; Peterson and Turner 1994). Water depth and physical structure (emergent and submergent plants and reefs) attract a subset of the Penaeidae (white, brown, and pink shrimp), Palaemonidae (grass shrimp), and Portunidae (swimming crabs such as the blue crab), at least near the edges of intertidal wetland habitats (e.g., Minello et al. 2008). Aquatic accessibility to coastal wetlands is a key factor controlling the composition and abundance of nekton assemblages, particularly in intertidal habitats (Rozas 1995; Kneib 1997; Minello et al. 2012). Several factors may affect the accessibility of coastal wetlands to nekton including the frequency and duration of tidal or storm-driven inundation of intertidal habitats (e.g., marshes, mangroves, tidal flats) and the presence of structural landscape features (e.g., passes, creek channels, and ditches) that facilitate nekton movements (Saucier and Baltz 1993; Raynie and Shaw 1994) among otherwise isolated aquatic elements (e.g., lagoons, ponds, and impoundments) embedded within coastal landscapes (Knudsen et al. 1989; Herke 1995). Unlike most coasts, which experience semidiurnal tides (i.e., two high and two low tides daily), much of the GoM experiences diurnal tides (i.e., 1 high and 1 low tide daily) as illustrated in Figure 6.16. Mixed tides have the characteristic of exhibiting appreciably different amplitudes in successive high and low water events and may be either diurnal or semidiurnal. All tides within the GoM are considered microtidal in that tidal amplitude is considerably <2 m. Note that tides along the west coast of Florida, as well as most of the Cuban coast, are semidiurnal while all other portions of the GoM experience diurnal tides. Increased accessibility to intertidal habitats associated with twice daily high tides (semidiurnal) in the eastern GoM may explain at least some of the greater similarities in dominant nekton species shared by these regions (Table 6.5)."
38,543,0.304,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"from individual population time series sourced from published and grey literature. The global database currently runs into thousands of such time series, and the index is calculated from a 1970 baseline to the current day. The global LPI, like many other metrics used to underpin indicators (Walpole et al. 2009) is not perfect. The data it is built upon are patchy both taxonomically and geographically, being particularly rich in data from bird populations and temperate regions (Collen et al. 2008, 2009), although the construction of the index attempts to offset these imbalances. Despite this, it has signiï¬cant strengths as an indicator in a number of ways. First, it taps into a vast resource of existing data, and so is cost effective. Population abundance, for vertebrates at least, is one of the most commonly collected measures, both in discrete, time-bound studies and from continuous monitoring. Second, it tells a simple, easily understood message of overall, aggregate change. The LPI has achieved prominence as a tool for communicating global biodiversity change to the public via its central role in WWFs periodic Living Planet Report (WWF 2012). Third, it can be cut in various ways to answer different questions and provide indicators for different policy targets. From the global dataset it is relatively simple to draw out subset analyses, or cuts, of the LPI focusing, for example, on wetland-dependent species (of relevance to the Ramsar Convention) or migratory species (of relevance to the CMS) or harvested species (of relevance to sustainable use and human wellbeing concerns). Fourth, it can be improved with new data sources. Knowing where the data gaps are enables a focus on ï¬lling those gaps, whether through unlocking more existing data or by investing in new monitoring. Fifth, it can be applied in different settings and different scales. A national LPI built from within-country studies of population abundances of different species is simple and cost-effective to construct. Moreover, the same approach can be applied to create an index of aggregate change in habitat extent, as has recently been created for wetland extent for the Ramsar Convention (Dixon et al. 2016). In the same way, harmonising the use of metrics across policy contexts is not only an efï¬cient use of resources but also creates greater awareness and potential for mainstreaming biodiversity into other development sectors. Globally, metrics of forest change, ï¬sheries, threatened species and protected area coverage have been used to provide indicators in the context of both the CBD and the Millennium Development Goals. Nationally, there are increasing efforts to incorporate ânatural capitalâ (including biodiversity and ecosystem services) into national accounts (King et al. 2015). The more that biodiversity data can be used in these contexts, the greater impact it will have on decision-making."

255,233,0.304,Railway Ecology,"Conclusions Our results provide a ï¬rst picture of the avian response to the presence and operation of HSR trains. Although the observed trends are not particularly prominent and are diluted by seasonal and inter-annual variability, they are consistent with the notion that train circulation could be responsible for a decrease in bird abundance in the traversed area. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the presence of the HSR has led to a process of ruderalization characterized by the increased numbers of species taking advantage of the railway. Some bird species representative of open and agricultural areas were found to avoid the HSR, whereas species that use man-made structures were found to be attracted to it. In fact, we documented the active use of these new elements, mainly the embankments and the catenary, by birds. In addition, birds alter their flight patterns near the railway, including showing some avoidance of it. However, birds risk train collision because such avoidance is not complete. Moreover, the species that are most exposed to train collisions are those that respond favorably to the railway and use its associated"

320,485,0.304,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Since 2007, it has been widely accepted that the global climate is warming and that human-induced increases in greenhouse gas emissions are mostly the cause (Kerr 2007). Global warming has been recognised to have profound impact on physical and biological systems. Of particular concern is the effect of global warming on biological diversity. Predictions of extinction have estimated that 20â30 % of species might face increasingly high risk of extinction. However, mechanisms of species persistence could lower the estimated extinction rate, while taking into consideration other human impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, landscape fragmentation or alien species introduction) could account for additional biodiversity loss (Botkin et al. 2007). Invasive species have been recognised as one of the most salient threats to biodiversity. Non-native species occurring in habitats where they were not present before the introduction are termed invaders or alien species. Rapidly increasing problems caused by invasive alien species worldwide demand the effective implementation of various policies aimed at reducing the impact of potentially or currently problematic non-native species (Richardson and PysÌek 2004). To understand changes in biodiversity, we must take into consideration at least the effects of global warming and the possibility that alien species might benefit from them. The future impact of global climate warming will vary from region to region. The most striking variation will involve changes in precipitation, and drought is expected in some areas like the Mediterranean (Kerr 2007). To these changes local species might respond with forced migrations. On the other hand, the alien invasive species already found in the Mediterranean might respond"

The process should be repeated with each new stocking event. â¢ Broodstock CollectionâAt least 30 days before each time a permittee or the permitteeâs designee intends to harvest broodstock from the Gulf, including state waters, they are required to submit a request for harvest to the RA. The request should include information on the number, size and species to be harvested, the methods, gear, and vessels used in capturing, holding, and transporting broodstock, the date and speciï¬c location of intended harvest, and the location of where the broodstock would be delivered. If the harvest is approved, the permittee would be notiï¬ed by the RA and required to submit a report within 15 days of the date of harvest summarizing the number, size, and species harvested and the location where the broodstock were captured. â¢ Stock GeneticsâNMFS may sample cultured animals to determine genetic lineage. If cultured animals. If cultured animals are determined to be genetically modiï¬ed or transgenic, then NMFS would order the removal of all these cultured animals. â¢ System EvaluationâAquaculture systems (e.g., cages or net pens) used for growing ï¬sh would be evaluated by the RA on a case-by-case basis. The structural integrity and ability of proposed systems to withstand physical stresses associated with major storm events (e.g., hurricanes) would be reviewed by the RA, using engineering analyses, computer and physical oceanographic models, or other required documentation. â¢ Risk AssessmentâThe RA will evaluate the potential risks of proposed aquaculture systems to Essential Fish Habitat, endangered or threatened species, marine mammals, wild ï¬sh stocks, public health, or safety. Any system approved for use should be marked with a minimum of one properly functioning locating device (e.g., GPS device) in the event that the allowable system is damaged or lost. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard requires structures be marked with lights and signals to ensure compliance with private aids to navigation. â¢ Facility SeparationâNo aquaculture facility should be sited within (3 km) of another facility to minimize transmission of pathogens between facilities. â¢ Restricted ZoneâA Restricted Zone will be established for each aquaculture facility to afford additional protection to an operationâs equipment and systems, and increase safety by reducing potential encounters with ï¬shing vessels. Restricted access zone boundaries should be clearly marked with a floating"

110,260,0.304,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"x Production risk concerns variations in crop yields and in livestock production due to weather conditions, diseases, and pests; x Market risk is related to the variations in commodity prices and quantities that can be marketed; x Financial risk relates to the ability to pay bills when due, to have money to continue farming, and to avoid bankruptcy; x Legal and environmental risk concerns the possibility of lawsuits initiated by other businesses or individuals, and changes in government regulation related to environment; x Human resources risk concerns the possibility that family or employees will not be available to provide labor or management to the farming business. It is clear from the classification above that not all of the risks are specific to agriculture but that some are rather common to all businesses. This is true for most of the financial, legal, and human resources risks. Among the risks that affect agriculture more specifically are production risks (due to weather, pests, and diseases) as well as market and price risks. In recent years, climate change has appeared as a new phenomenon and risk category. Across the globe, it has a considerable influence on agricultural production and in some parts of the world has led to fundamental changes in production patterns and conditions. For the following discussion it is useful to differentiate between these principal (or common) risks and specific risks. Risks in Agricultural Finance Fundamentally, the risks in lending essentially hinge on the borrowerâs capacity and willingness to repay a loan, with the former depending on the viability of the business and the latter on the borrowerâs character. This is no different in agricultural lending. Here again, it is useful to differentiate between principal and specific risks. The risks in agricultural finance comprise to a considerable extent common risks associated with the viability of the farm business and the farmerâs character, not much different from the risks of micro and small businesses in other economic sectors. In addition, farm businesses are exposed to specific production and market risks that may affect their repayment capacity. Finally, given the strategic importance of agriculture for food security, agricultural finance is subject to political interference in many countries. This poses significant political risks to agricultural lending institutions since political interventions often turn out to be detrimental to lending to farmers. Hence, the following sections discuss these three categories: principal credit risks, specific risks related to agriculture, and political risks. 2.2 Principal Credit Risks Lending to small farmers exposes credit institutions to principal credit risks that are similar to those of micro and small enterprises in general. This is explained by"

In the reform of 2013, this desideratum was reinforced, as stated notably in Art. 2 of Regulation No. 1380/2013: application of the ecosystem-based approach, fostering the collection of scientific data, decisions taken under the best available scientific advice, new strategy for discards, and coherence with the European Union environmental legislation.

376,667,0.303,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","In rangelands, various zoonoses (rabies, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, etc.) can be hosted by wildlife species but are most commonly transmitted to humans through their domesticated animals. For example, brucellosis, which affects most pastoral societies, is one of the most common zoonotic infections worldwide with more than 500,000 new cases annually (Pappas et al. 2006). Also, because human populations in rangelands depend to greater or lesser degrees on domesticated animals for their livelihoods, nonzoonotic diseases with wildlife reservoirs, such as foot-and-mouth disease, are also of concern. Political and social controversies at the interface between domesticated and wild animals in rangelands are thus likely to include disease issues of some type (Kock et al. 2010). Such controversies are heightened by the poor success rate of campaigns to eradicate diseases in wildlife reservoirs, with the notable exception of fox rabies in Europe where a safe and effective vaccine bait was available (Brochier et al. 1991). In systems where diseases co-circulate in livestock and wildlife, control efforts can be successful when they are targeted in livestock, such as with rinderpest for example (Mariner et al. 2012; Roeder et al. 2013). Similarly, in Spain,"

The harvested area of soyabeans multiplied from 38,000 hectares (Ha) in 1970 to 18 million Ha in 2009, accounting for more than half of the total agricultural land (MAGyP, 2011). The predominant biomass ï¬ow in the economy of Argentina is still grazing, foraging, silage and by-products. Nevertheless, the expansion of soyabean crops diminished the amount of land available for cattle-grazing. Millions of hectares that were in agricultural-cattle rotation have been allocated to permanent agriculture, while livestock increasingly depends on feed crops (i.e. cereal, soymeal) (SantarcÃ¡ngelo and Fal, 2009; PEA, 2010). These trends have contributed to an increased number of conï¬icts over land in Argentina, as peasants and indigenous groups are confronted with the expansion of the soy-extraction frontier into their lands (Aranda, 2010). The expansion of the agricultural frontier has led to the clearing of lands and forest, as well as the displacement of many indigenous and rural populations (Teubal, 2006). This has resulted in various conï¬icts over access to land. This is the case for the inhabitants of La Primavera (Formosa, Argentina), who have been displaced by the expansion of soy production ever since 2008. Indigenous communities have been dispossessed of their lands, and the Qom people are struggling to recover 5,000 Ha (AsociaciÃ³n Civil Nodo Tau, 2010; GarcÃ­a-LÃ³pez and Arizpe, 2010). The increased use of chemicals in genetically modiï¬ed (GM) crops has also triggered an increasing number of conï¬icts related to the health impacts. This is the case for the âmothers of ItuzaingÃ³â of Cordoba, who lead a movement that is mainly composed of women who since 2001 have been demanding that the provincial government stop the air fumigation of soy ï¬elds. The spraying of large amounts of glyphosate near urban areas was causing cases of cancer (mostly in children) and birth defects induced by contamination. In 2009 the movement succeeded in forbidding the spraying of this product in urban areas (GRR, 2009). Incidentally, some invasive species such as Aleppo sorghum (or Johnsson grass) acquired resistance to glyphosate spraying, and as a result agriculture steps not only into a pesticide treadmill but also into a âtransgenic treadmillâ (Binimelis, Pengue and Monterroso, 2009). Tree plantations have similarly been the subject of socioenvironmental conï¬icts. As analysed by Gerber (2011), industrial tree plantations for wood, palm oil and rubber production are among the fastest-growing monocultures and are currently being promoted as carbon sinks and energy producers. Such plantations are causing a large number of"

On the other hand, flexibility between species is allowed. Catches of species that are subject to the landing obligation and that are caught in excess of quotas of the stocks in question, or catches of species in respect of which the MS has no quota, may be deducted from the quota of the target species provided that they do not exceed 9% of the quota of the target species.86 This second possibilityâflexibility between speciesâhas been seen by some as a breach of RS in favor of the autonomy of MSs, as it allows applying not used-up quotas to other species for which there is no quota, or for which quotas have been exceeded.87 In summary, RS maintains its flexibility mechanisms (quota swapping and yearto-year flexibility), the landing obligation is not absolute (with the exemptions of high survivability, de minimis, prohibited species, and predator-damaged fish), the fishing opportunities that take into account the effect of discards are expected to increase, and some flexibility between species will be admitted. Will this be enough? The biggest concern is with the so-called choke species, which may even further reduce quota exchanges. MSs that previously got rid of certain quotas will now need them to cover the discard ban to prevent that other species strangle the catches of its target species. The real challenges lie with the demersal species. Although we will have to wait to see what happens on the fishing grounds, the experience with pelagic species has not been encouraging. In this case, the choke species have not stimulated quota exchanges but rather reduced them.88 At this point, it should be remembered that one of the objectives of the CFP is to increase productivity in fisheries by ensuring the rational development of fisheries production and the optimum utilization of the factors of production, in particular labor.89 A notion that must be understood in the light of other objectives, which include a fair standard of living for the fishing community and supply at reasonable prices. This management of resources must also take into account the peculiarities resulting from structural and natural disparities between the various fishing regions,"

Based on 301 samples collected in 1986 and 1987 by the NOAA NS&T Program, it was concluded that pesticides and PCBs were pervasive at low concentrations in sediments along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast (Sericano et al. 1990). DDT was detected in more than 88 % of the samples with the highest concentrations found in sediments in bays in Florida, Alabama, and Texas. The highest non-DDT pesticide concentrations in sediments were found in Choctawhatchee, Naples, Tampa, St. Andrew, and Rookery bays, Florida; Biloxi Bay and Breton Sound, Mississippi; Terrebonne and Barataria bays, Louisiana; and Galveston and Matagorda bays, Texas. Pesticide concentrations were similar to those previously reported for coastal sediments from the northern Gulf of Mexico. PCBs were commonly detected in sediments in the northern Gulf of Mexico bays with high concentrations in Texas and Florida bays. PCB concentrations in sediments were spatially heterogeneous within bays. While pesticides and PCBs were ubiquitous in sediments, concentrations were less than ERL values (note that highly contaminated sites were avoided). Tissues from nearby biological organisms exceeded sediment concentrations by several-fold, indicating bioaccumulation. Other subsets of NS&T Program data have been analyzed to highlight the occurrences and distributions of specific chemicals in coastal environments. For example, Apeti et al. (2009) report that high sediment concentrations of Cd (high was defined as the highest 15 % of concentrations measured at 200 U.S. coastal sites) were located in Tampa Bay (Hillsborough Bay), Florida; the Mississippi River (Tiger Pass and Pass A Loutre), Louisiana; Breton Sound (Sable Island), Louisiana; Galveston Bay (Offats Bayou), Texas; Nueces Bay, Texas, and at a marina near Corpus Christi, Texas. Nevertheless, all sediment Cd concentrations in the northern Gulf of Mexico were below ERL values. Cd concentrations in bivalve tissues were poorly correlated with nearby sediment concentrations (adjusted for grain size) but significantly correlated with proximity to population centers. Diagenetic remobilization of Cd reduced concentrations in surficial sediments and may be one reason for the poor correlation between tissue and sediment concentrations."

Hunting and fishing is carried out in a more playful manner.16 For girls, fishing and gathering represents the predominant component of their time investment in the economic system. Clearly, children do lighter work and may do it less efficiently than adults. Nevertheless, approximately one-third of the total labour hours in Campo Bello and Sabawas are contributed by children. As documented by Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2010), children in Campo Bello also spend approximately the same fraction of their day working as the average inhabitant. In addition to making up a smaller percentage of the populations of Nalang and Trinket, children in these communities also appear to have a lower labour burden. Due to their substantially lower share in household and economic work, they have the opportunity to spend the remainder of their day on person system activities, such as studying and personal recreation. These results, however selective, lend support to Cainâs (1981) argument that agricultural communities with higher demographic proportions of children place a high labour burden on them. Framed differently, communities in which children are considered of high use value in terms of labour contribution (either for technological or cultural reasons) tend to have more children. We find that the community with the highest percentage of the population under 15 years of age (61 %) also has the highest share of child labour (Campo Bello). Sabawas, the community with the second highest child population (55 %), also places a relatively high labour burden on their children. Nalangâs children, in contrast, are less burdened with labour, particularly household labour. Finally, Trinket has the lowest demographic reproduction rate and the lowest share of child labour."

230,310,0.302,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Hence, considerable quantities of end-of-life plastics are accumulating in land fills and in the natural environment. The quantity of end-of-life plastic in the marine environment is substantial but as yet there are few reliable estimates of the total amount, or the relative proportions of different types of debris such as microplastic. Recent studies have attempted to assess global distributions (CÃ³zar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al. 2014), the logical next step could be to estimate total production, current tonnage in use and accumulated disposal via recognized waste management in order to establish via a mass balance the amount of plastic that is missing and potentially in the environment (Jambeck et al. 2015). It is apparent that end-of-life plastic items are abundant and widely distributed in the oceans and that these items are progressively fragmenting into small pieces which are now abundant in the environment (Fig. 7.6). In some locations, it is evident that microplastics are numerically, as opposed to by mass, the most abundant type of solid debris present (Browne et al. 2010). However, despite the deterioration of plastic items into plastic fragments, conventional plastics will not readily biodegrade and it is considered that all of the plastics that have ever been produced are still present Fig. 7.6 Accumulation of plastic debris on a shoreline in Europe. Small fragments of plastic including microplastics pieces <5 mm are often overlooked during routine beach monitoring, but are now the most abundant items on many shorelines (Photo: R.C. Thompson)"

These major changes would destroy the Omo riverine natural resource systemsâeliminating âlast resortâ grazing lands for livestock, flood recession agriculture and ï¬shing habitats throughout the lowermost Omo basin. The impending destruction of indigenous survival systems is heightened by the Ethiopian governmentâs expropriation of tens of thousands of villagers for large-scale, irrigated commercial agricultural enterprises, accompanied by political repression of communities through-out the region. Pastoralists and ï¬shers residing near the western shoreline of Kenyaâs Lake Turkana also face economic collapseâprimarily due to radical lake level drop causing destruction of ï¬sh habitat, lakeside grazing for livestock and potable water. As in the lower Omo basin, these conditions would produce massive scale hunger along with widespread disease.

Signiï¬cant pressure fuelled by SVP volunteers has encouraged a process of maternal mortality review, but compliance across the HUB remains patchy. As such, all facility-generated data must be regarded as a social construction.10 Nevertheless, it serves one of the most important functions of quantitative data: it indicates trends and raises critical questions. During the early months of the LMP project (and very much playing the role of handmaiden to the obstetrician lead) we took it at face value that these were the causes of maternal deaths rather than the ï¬nal âhitâ on the protracted âroad to deathâ (Filippi et al. 2005). Faced with the alarming volume of maternal and neonatal deaths occurring in these referral facilities and the earlier âevidenceâ on causation, it may come as no surprise that the overwhelming initial response was to advocate the introduction of (imported/amended) protocols and Table 5.2 Causes and frequencies of maternal deaths in Mulago (Jan-12 to Dec-12) Causes of death Abortion Eclampsia Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) Anaemia Ruptured uterus HIV-related Respiratory distress Cardiac arrest on table Puerperal sepsis Malaria in pregnancy Tetanus Ruptured ectopic Dead on arrival Total Source: McKay and Ackers 2013."

A south to north gradient of forest development (from younger to older plant communities) is evident from detailed plant ecological studies at the sites indicated in Fig. 8.8. The Gibe III dam and dam enabled large-scale irrigation agriculture would cause the cessation of flooding of riverside flats where the Nyangatom carry out their main survival activityâflood recession agriculture. These developments would also destroy the vast majority of riverine zone vegetation types shown in maps. This destruction of vegetation, in turn, would eliminate Nyangatom (and Dasanech) last remaining areas pasturage for livestock grazing, wild food gathering, hunting and other activities that are their only means of survival during the most severe hardship periods."
232,168,0.302,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The consequences of a nuclear accident are numerous and intricate. An accident has on-site consequences, such as casualties, highly-irradiated workers or material losses in adjacent reactors. It also causes off-site consequences, such as the release of radioactive materials in the atmosphere, the collective absorbed dose, the area of contaminated lands or the quantity of crops and cattle contaminated. The negative consequences of the countermeasures, such as psychological distress, also have to be estimated. Yet, these numerous consequences have to be assessed in order to derive their monetary value. The source of divergence in the assessment of the consequences is twofold. First, all studies do not assess the same range of consequences. Some studies argue that health effects dominate all other effects [15, 19, 20].

Rivers increasingly suffer from pollution, water abstraction, river channelization, and damming. Fundamental knowledge of ecosystem structure and function is necessary to understand how human activities interfere with natural processes and what interventions are feasible to rectify this. The speciï¬cs of such management leverage points become clear through elucidation of cause-effect relationships, especially how socioeconomic drivers create pressures on rivers and how those pressures alter ecosystem functions and impact fauna and ï¬ora. Modern water legislation strives for sustainable water resource management and protection of important habitats and species. However, decision-makers would beneï¬t from more profound understanding of ecosystem degradation processes and of innovative methodologies and tools for efï¬cient mitigation and restoration. This becomes especially important for threats where current policies are ineffective, and both policy and management must support research that identiï¬es solutions. The book provides best-practice examples of sustainable river management from on-site studies, European-wide analyses, and case studies from other parts of the world. It will be of interest to researchers (graduate and post-graduate) in the ï¬elds of aquatic ecology, river system functioning, conservation and restoration, to institutions involved in water management, and to water-related industries. The current wealth of textbooks on river ecology extensively describes structures and functions of riverine ecosystems but gives less attention to river management (Cushing et al. 1995; Giller and Malmqvist 1998; Naiman and Bilby 1998; Allan and Castillo 2007; Dudgeon 2008; Likens 2010). By contrast our book directly targets riverine ecosystem management by examining the formulation and application of policy and providing sufï¬cient depth of river ecology to inform competent decisionmaking in governance."

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005) popularised the term and drew on findings across hydrology, systems modelling, development economics, resilience theory and others to advance the concept and its applications. Much of the effort in ecosystem services has been in delineating and classifying ecosystem service types and processes, and in mapping and measuring ecosystem services and their benefits (Nicholls et al. 2016; Naidoo et al. 2008). In addition, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment sought to characterise long-term future trends and sustainability through global and sub-global scenarios. The principal tenets of ecosystem service science are firstly that the observed decline in ecosystem services at all scales is widely caused by human action. The drivers of decline include the scale of economic activity, not least in extraction of renewable resources such as forests and fisheries, unsustainable pollution loading and the trade-off between the selective enhancements of some ecosystem services at the detriment of others (MEA 2005; Bennett et al. 2009). In the field of ecological economics, initial aggregation of the benefits of nature sought to make them commensurable, and to compare aggregate ecosystem service benefits to the scale of economic activity. Costanza et al. (1997) strongly argued that ecosystems provide unaccounted-for benefits to society that are of greater magnitude than the whole of the global economy by standard economic metrics. Assessments of interventions to preserve natural areas or conserve specific ecosystem functions show that such actions generate benefits that are often orders of magnitude greater than their costs (Balmford et al. 2002). Yet many elements of the relationship between ecosystems and the environment remain poorly established, not least in coastal and marine environments, such as deltas. What constitutes an ecosystem service, for example, comes into sharp relief in delta environments. In practice, classification systems for ecosystem services are based on both the characteristics of the ecosystem of interest and the decision-making context. Ecosystems provide direct provisioning for humans, through processes of cultivation or extraction of food and fibre. Ecosystems regulate the environment through absorbing and processing pollutants or acting as shelter, barrier or other elements of human habitat. Ecosystems also have"

However, if fatalities are broadly distributed, then facilitywide mitigation strategies would be necessary (Arnett et al. 2008). Thus far, studies worldwide have failed to detect specific turbines responsible for most fatalities at any given facility. Other patterns at scales beyond individual turbines have been reported that may assist with assessing risk. Baerwald and Barclay (2011) found no differences in"

It is estimated that non-human primates represent a very small proportion of the total number of animals used in experiments: fewer than 1 in 1,000 in the EU and approximately 3 in 1,000 in the US (SCHER 2009). Worldwide, however, the number may be more than 100,000 each year. The wide variety of non-human primate species used in research can be divided into New World species such as marmosets (e.g. the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus), and Old World species such as the long-tailed or cynomolgus or crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).

302,388,0.301,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"6 Conclusion Increased research on (micro)plastics has developed the picture that (micro)plastic pollution is ubiquitous. Microplastics have been detected in rivers in Europe (e.g., Danube, [70]), as well as in lakes in Mongolia [50] and the USA [59]. They cross state boarders, passing from rivers into lakes, and finally into the global common, the ocean. They also cross the boundaries between single organisms, accumulating in the food web. From a social-ecological perspective, the risk induces a vibrancy and resonance in socioeconomic, political, and public spheres. Thus, the theses we have presented and their corresponding data clearly identify microplastics as a global risk, leading to the following conclusions regarding further research areas: Based on an understanding of the risks posed by microplastics as an unintended side effect of the everyday mode of societies, the global dimensions of production and distribution patterns need to be researched in more depth. In many countries of the Global South, a new middle income class with a high demand for plastic products is growing. Relations between the Global North and the Global South need to be addressed more adequately, regarding the production, distribution, consumption, disposal, and leakage into the environment of plastic-packaged products like fast-moving consumer goods. Due to the complexity of the microplastics phenomenon, its assessment is difficult and requires further scientific investigations to establish the evidence in order to properly address the environmental risk. The same holds true for the assessment of the human health risks. This uncertainty impedes risk management decisions, but nevertheless action is required despite a lack of clear evidence, because microplastics are perceived as a threat by society. Therefore, as the complexity of the phenomenon may never be entirely resolved, future research should also focus on the question of how to handle uncertainty and manage complex global risks. Although it is common sense that plastics should not be allowed to accumulate in the environment, much less consensus exists regarding the strategies needed to achieve this. As Shaxson [58] points out, the question âHow can we make plastics sustainable?â is just too broad and unstructured to enable all the interest groups to speak with one voice. Strategies to combat pollution range from reuse, green chemistry, designs for recycling, improved waste management, standardized labeling, education, cleaning programs, and sustainable consumption. Not a single strategy is required, but each sector needs to be active. However, current debates show that responsibilities are often shifted elsewhere. Thus, identifying the risk producers is not straightforward, as some voices do not regard plastics as the source of the problem but rather their improper disposal; other voices emphasize the design of the plastic material, and yet others target consumer behavior. Risk management is about the negotiation of evidence and values. We should not stop at symbolic goals, like the G7 Action Plan [71], but move on to binding regulations. Research should focus on developing and testing mechanisms to call risk producers to account, for example, with the integration of costs in the benefits, extended producersâ responsibility, cost of inaction analysis, etc."

389,361,0.301,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"A Japanese governmental agency (Fisheries Agency) and local governments initiated monitoring programs soon after the Fukushima fallout to monitor radioactivity contamination in freshwater and marine fish and invertebrates in the affected areas. The results revealed that radiocesium contamination was transferred quickly to freshwater and marine ecosystems, and elevated radiocesium concentrations were detected in many fish and invertebrates (Fisheries Agency 2012). These concentrations decreased over time in most of the epipelagic fish and neustonic organisms (Buesseler 2012). However, some demersal fish off the coast of Fukushima and some freshwater fish in central and northern Honshu Island continue to exhibit higher radiocesium concentrations (Tateda et al. 2013). Freshwater masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) from the Niida River in Fukushima Prefecture contained the highest measured radiocesium concentrations in March 2012 (18,700 Bq/kg-wet weight; Fisheries Agency 2012). Restrictions have been placed on shipping and consumption of 19 commercially important freshwater fish and invertebrate species as of October 2013 in the extensive deposition area of central and northern Honshu Island. Because of differences in osmoregulatory physiology, radionuclides usually bioaccumulate at higher concentrations in freshwater compared with marine fish. After the Chernobyl nuclear accident (Ukraine), higher radiocesium concentrations persisted in freshwater fish from several European lakes for 10 years and more (Jonsson et al. 1999; Brittain and Gjerseth 2010; Rask et al. 2012). Lake-dwelling freshwater fish in high deposition areas may also sustain long-standing radionuclide contamination, which results from radionuclide recycling within the aquatic environment (Smith and Comans 1996). In this chapter, we describe radiocesium concentrations in muscle and eggs of masu salmon, kokanee, O. nerka; brown trout, Salmo trutta; and lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, from the Lake Chuzenji system, central Honshu Island, Japan (Fig. 18.1) to understand the effects of radionuclide contamination on salmonid fish. Although Lake Chuzenji is approximately 160 km from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP) in linear distance, the lake watershed area received radiocesium deposits of 8â36 kBq/m2 after the Fukushima accident (Fisheries Research Agency 2012). Salmonid fish support important recreational and commercial fisheries throughout the Japanese Archipelago. Salmonid eggs (usually raw eggs) are also an important food resource for the Japanese."

36,669,0.301,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"exits or the destruction of a roost should only be considered during times when bats are not using the roost, e.g., outside the reproduction or hibernation period. Otherwise, bats may be trapped and killed, which is against animal welfare. If roosts are destroyed or closed, bats may switch to alternative roosts (Neilson and Fenton 1994). After eviction of Eptesicus fuscus from buildings, females produced fewer offspring at alternative sites, even though foraging behavior remained constant (Brigham and Fenton 1986). Relocation of bats to nearby habitats usually fails because bats will return to their original roost in most cases. Lastly, the permanent eviction of bats from roosts may increase the frequency of roost switching. In the case of species with a high prevalence of rabies infections, it is predicted that the rabies transmission risk may increase due to more, and possibly undirected, movements of evicted bats around buildings (e.g., Eptesicus fuscus, Streicker et al. 2013). Therefore, roost closures might have unforeseen and unwanted side effects for public health."

358,179,0.301,The Golden and Ghoulish Age of the Gibbet in Britain,"from the treatment of an ordinary dead body, there is some ambivalence in participating as a spectator or crowd member in the carnival of the gibbet. It is thrilling to see, to be physically close to, a dangerous criminal body, but it is also transgressive. The glamorous appeal of the criminal dead is built on the fame or notoriety of the individual whose body it is/was and the attendant thrill of danger. An encounter with the living body of a criminalâespecially a violent oneâis dangerous. The potential risk of physical harm, however, is tamed by execution. The criminal corpse still looks like the thing it was but is rendered inertâharmlessâby death. The family picnic under the gibbet is analogous to the photograph of a grinning hunter with his foot on the neck of a dead lion: an easy claim to bravery and a bid for contagious glamour. The gibbeted body is both less and more than a dead human being. It is less because the richness of experience, the animation of life is gone; more because it has acquired symbolic properties that were never present before."
151,285,0.301,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Mammals are far less sensitive than birds to acute exposures of chlorpyrifos (see review in Solomon et al. 2001). In addition, mammals are less exposed to granular CPY because they do not consume grit to aid digestion as do birds (Solomon et al. 2001). Therefore, risks due to exposure to CPY are likely to be greater for birds than for mammals. We did not conduct a refined risk assessment for mammals because any mitigations stemming from the avian risk assessment should also be protective of mammals foraging in treated fields. This assessment builds upon past assessments of CPY, including the most recent EPA re-registration assessment (USEPA 1999) and a refined risk assessment to birds by Solomon et al. (2001). Using a conservative, screening-level risk assessment approach, the USEPA (1999) concluded that single and multiple applications of CPY potentially pose risks to birds. However, a more refined assessment of exposure based on simulations and analyses of field studies and incident reports demonstrated that the risks of exposure to flowable and granular CPY were small (Solomon et al. 2001). Solomon et al. (2001) used a probabilistic individual-based model to predict mortality for eight focal species exposed to flowable and granular CPY in corn. The model predicted that the eight focal species would not experience any mortality. Since the completion of the assessments by USEPA (1999) and Solomon et al. (2001), the labels have been amended to require buffer zones, reduce single and seasonal application rates, reduce the number of applications per season, and increase the minimum re-treatment intervals (USEPA 2009). In addition, EPA is preparing a new assessment of risk of flowable and granular formulations of CPY to birds that will make use of their standard screening-level risk assessment approach (USEPA 2008a). An initial draft of the reassessment by EPA was to be released for public comment in the latter part of 2013 (USEPA 2009). A refined assessment of risks posed by labeled uses of CPY in agriculture in the USA was conducted to reflect changes made to the label and the availability of new information and methods for conducting exposure assessments of birds to insecticides. We initiated the preparation of this assessment by carefully formulating the problem to be addressed. Such problem formulation establishes the scope of the assessment, including defining the routes of exposure to be considered, focal species of birds and patterns of use. The problem formulation concludes with an analysis plan. Subsequent sections describe the methods and assumptions for assessing exposure and effects and characterization of risks. This paper is part of a series that describes the properties and environmental chemodynamics (Solomon et al. 2014), long-range atmospheric transport (Mackay et al. 2014), concentrations in aquatic environments (Williams et al. 2014), risks to aquatic organisms (Giddings et al. 2013), and risks to pollinators (Cutler et al. 2014) of CPY."
36,674,0.301,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"14.6.4 Loss of Roosts Due to Demographic Changes in the Human Population Demographic changes in human populations of many countries are turning rural areas into areas nearly devoid of humans. As a result, buildings are abandoned and, due to a lack of maintenance, deteriorate over time. Shortly after abandonment, many synanthropic bat species benefit, likely due to the reduced disturbance by humans. Deserted buildings may provide new roosting structures for bats, e.g., for Hipposideros nicobarulae in Myanmar (Douangboupha et al. 2012). Yet in the long run, synanthropic bats may vanish from these sites when buildings deteriorate (Sachanowicz and Wower 2013). Another effect of demographic changes involves movement and thus concentration of people in urban areas. Following this, previously unused buildings, even in industrial areas, or unoccupied space under the roof of buildings are converted into houses or apartments to host the influx of people in cities. This may cause losses of roosting opportunities for synanthropic bats. In China, like in many Asian countries, a vast number of old buildings are demolished during the process of modernization and this reduces the density of roosts significantly for synanthropic bats (Zhang et al. 2009)."

260,24,0.301,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"cities were infected with ranavirus. Similarly, Kolby et al. (2014) found over 50 % of amphibians exported via Hong Kong International Airport were infected with ranavirus. Reptiles infected with ranaviruses also have been discovered in internationally traded animals (Hyatt et al. 2002; StÃ¶hr et al. 2013b, 2015). Finally, internationally traded ornamental fishes have been shown to be infected with ranaviruses (Hedrick and McDowell 1995). While the outcome of infection varies among hosts and strains of ranaviruses, it is clear that ranaviruses have the potential to cause population declines and extinctions (Teacher et al. 2010; Price et al. 2014; Earl and Gray 2014). They may present a significant threat to host species that are geographically isolated or exist at low abundance (Heard et al. 2013; Price et al. 2014; Earl and Gray 2014). Thus, highly susceptible host species that are rare may be at greatest risk (Earl and Gray 2014). However, common species also can be affected. For example, populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria) have declined on average 80 % in the UK where ranavirus die-offs have reoccurred (Teacher et al. 2010). It is therefore important to understand the geographic extent, host range, and phylogenetic relationships of these emerging pathogens (Jancovich et al. 2015)."

38,542,0.3,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"there were no invasion indicators that had been developed for reporting at a global scale (Genovesi et al. 2013). There were many sources of information, but no collated body of data with global coverage on which species were where, and what impact they were having, particularly not for a range of taxonomic groups (McGeoch et al. 2012). Apart from many local case studies and a few regional ones (notably for Europe) there were also very few data on changes in the numbers of species threatening biodiversity over time. The solution was to tackle the problem from three angles (McGeoch et al. 2010). First, using an operational deï¬nition that distinguished alien from invasive species (McGeoch et al. 2012), a stratiï¬ed, random subset of countries was chosen to calculate the number of invasive species per country. This provided a robust, representative baseline measure of invasion pressure on countries that can now be tracked over time. Second, the well-known IUCN Red List Index (http://www.bipindicators.net/rli/2010; Butchart 2008) was used to illustrate trends in the extinction risk of a subset of species threatened by invasive species. Finally, information on policy trends relevant to invasion was used to indicate how countries were responding to the problem. In sum, by using a combination of systematic data collation, adaptation of an existing indicator, and data on policy trends, an informative indicator for biological invasion was born. Certain metrics can be used to create multiple indicators for different purposes, as illustrated earlier for forest extent (see also Box 12.2). This demonstrates the value and importance of focusing on the key metrics, or Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs; Pereira et al. 2013) that, when cut in certain ways and/or combined with ancillary data, can provide the most information on biodiversity change. Indicators for many of the Aichi Targets can be derived from a relatively small set of such metrics (Geijzendorffer et al. 2016; for an example, see Fig. 1.2). Equally, where metrics can be standardised across scales, there is great potential for efï¬ciency. Although national priorities are generally to develop indicators for speciï¬c national needs (including national goals and targets), there is a lot to be said for exploring and enhancing harmonised indicator use as a means of (i) increasing the availability of data for tracking progress towards broader scale, regional and global goals and targets and (ii) unlocking the value of global data sets, such as those in products derived from satellite remote sensing, for wider national use (Han et al. 2014). Box 12.2. Indicator Pragmatism: The Living Planet Index The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a metric of aggregate change in vertebrate population abundance over time in reference to a baseline year at which the index is set at a value of 100 (Loh et al. 2005; Collen et al. 2009).

389,182,0.3,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"epipelagic fishes was close to 1.0 (Fig. 8.2, Table 8.1). This ratio is consistent with the 134Cs/137Cs concentration ratio already reported in seawater and marine organisms (Aoyama et al. 2012; Wada et al. 2013). The ratio indicated that the 134Cs and most of the 137Cs detected in these small epipelagic fishes originated from the FNPP accident. The concentration of 137Cs in muscle and whole bodies without internal organs of sardines collected off the Kanto area in 2010, before the FNPP accident, was 0.052 Â± 0.0038 Bq/kg-wet and 0.030 Â± 0.0044 Bq/kg-wet, respectively (Fisheries Research Agency 2012). The previous report showed the summed concentration of 134Cs and 137Cs in raw measurement specimens for muscle of sardine and anchovy (Takagi et al. 2014). These concentrations were 61.0 % to 155.9 % of the sum concentration of 134Cs and Cs in the ashed measurement specimen consisting of the same samples as the raw measurement specimen. Figure 8.3 shows the temporal variation of 131I and 137Cs concentrations in the internal organs of sardine and anchovy. The maximum concentrations of 131I, 134Cs, and 137Cs were 309.08 Â± 2.06 Bq/kg-wet, 61.01 Â± 0.52 Bq/ kg-wet, and 59.63 Â± 0.39 Bq/kg-wet, respectively, in the internal organs of anchovy collected 24 March 2011 (Fig. 8.3, Table 8.1). There was no detection of 131I on 26 April 2011 because of the short physical half-life, 8.02 days. The concentrations of I in the internal organs of sardine and anchovy until 26 April 2011 decreased to half by 4.4 and 4.6 days, respectively. The respective concentrations in fishes collected in region B were obviously lower than those in region A. It was clear that the reason was the distance from FNPP to each sampling region. The concentration of 131I in the internal organs tended to be higher than those in other measurement specimens, although no clear tendency was observed for 134Cs and 137Cs (Table 8.1). Although the concentration factor of iodine in fish is from 9 to 10, the factor of iodine in phytoplankton and zooplankton is from 800 to 1,000 (IAEA 2004). The measurement specimen from the internal organs of sardine and anchovy, which are plankton feeders, could include some plankton. Therefore, the higher concentrations of 131I would be detected in the internal organ specimens from sardine and anchovy."
35,655,0.3,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"maximizing the productivity of ocean installations for seafood, energy and scientiï¬c pursuits, and there has been a considerable amount of thinking and discussion that has taken place globally in recent years to realize this goal. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of the co-authors of this volume, as their expertise and experience represents the state of knowledge on the topic of aquaculture as a potential multi-use of ocean platforms. We have covered technical, operational, biological, economic, social and political considerations, as well as case studies, where aquaculture was implemented at pilot scale on offshore oil rigs and wind turbine platforms. One important area that was not covered in this book was environmental and ecological risks associated with aquaculture. While we acknowledge that environment issues are extremely important, we felt that they have been covered exhaustively over the past three decades and that further discussion would not have added new information for this volume. A recent review paper by the US Department of Commerceâs National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration (Price and Morris 2013) does an excellent job of synthesizing thirty years of literature on all environmental aspects of marine ï¬sh cage culture, so we recommend that report to readers with interest of this topic. While most environmental impacts have been associated with marine ï¬nï¬sh culture, there are some concerns with shellï¬sh and macroalgae culture though to a much lesser extent. These issues are also covered extensively in the literature (Fabia et al. 2009; Hatcher et al. 1994; Langan 2007, 2012; Lloyd 2003; Paul 1999; Plew et al. 2005; Price et al. 2015)"
36,134,0.3,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"In a multitaxon assessment in Brazil, Barlow et al. (2007) found similar numbers of bat species in Eucalyptus plantations and secondary forests recovering from burning, but both habitats supported much lower richness than did unlogged forests. Bat assemblages in plantations were nested subsets of those in forests; approximately 11 % of all species were shared between plantations and primary forest, 4 % were shared with secondary forest, and 39 % found in all habitats (Louzada et al. 2010). Nevertheless, three species (ca. 6 % of total) were captured exclusively in Eucalyptus plantations. A study in Brazilian Cerrado found lower species richness, diversity, and evenness of bat assemblages in Eucalyptus monocultures than in fragments of native Cerrado vegetation (Pina et al. 2013). Gleaning animalivorous phyllostomid bats were not captured in plantation forests. An earlier comparative study in Sumatra documented a distinct shift in bat assemblage structure in rubber and oil palm plantations, which supported only 13â25 % of the bat species richness found in forest (Danielsen and Heegaard 1995). However, more recent surveys have revealed additional species utilizing rubber plantations, especially those grown as agroforests or close to forest areas (Prasetyo et al. 2011). These studies point to an adverse response by bats to plantation development in both the New and Old World tropics. However, the extent to which these findings reflect true bat declines versus sampling bias (i.e., difficulties in capturing bats in open plantation habitats) is open to question. Tree plantations present a much more open habitat compared to forests, but can provide canopy structure similar to that in forest. This may present difficulties for capturing bats in these habitats, particularly in the Paleotropics, where much of the insectivorous bat fauna can only be captured in harp traps. Bat surveys in Sumatra and Borneo have resulted in extremely low capture rates for insectivorous species in oil palm plantations using mist nets and harp traps (Fukuda et al. 2009; Syamsi 2013), a finding that could reflect differential capture success in closed versus open habitats as well as true differences between habitats. Acoustic surveys could potentially contribute additional information concerning bat activity and the structure of bat assemblages in these habitats. The first insights from the Old World come from southern Thailand, where Phommexay et al. (2011) sampled bats in forest and neighboring rubber plantations using bat detectors, mist nets, and harp traps. Although diversity and overall bat activity were much lower in plantations than in forests, differences between the two habitat types were not as severe as indicated by capture-based surveys. Acoustic sampling in plantations detected less than half the number of bat species found in forest and fewer bat passes. Although bat activity was clearly reduced in plantations, a substantial number of feeding buzzes were detected, suggesting that bats were still foraging in this modified habitat. Key research needs: â¢ Further studies, particularly those using acoustic methods, to accurately assess the conservation value of tree plantations for tropical bats."
231,1070,0.3,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The chapter starts with a discussion of general patterns and processes (Sect. 11.2), such as impacts of climate change on productivity, phenology and biodiversity. Climate impacts on speciï¬c ecosystem types, such as forests, grasslands and mires are discussed in more detail in subsequent sections (Sects. 11.3â11.6). The chapter concludes by discussing links between changes in inland ecosystems and the wider North Sea system (Sect. 11.7) and then summarises the main ï¬ndings of this assessment in the form of a table (Sect. 11.8). The chapter focuses on the direct impacts of climate change; the potential impacts of indirect drivers are beyond the scope of this chapter."

Typical issues include consideration of only one or few climate models, greenhouse gas scenarios and/or hydrological models; poor calibration and validation of models; and inaccuracies of the models in extrapolating beyond historical conditions."

36,205,0.3,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"A high percentage of open ground in some planted forests can benefit species that specialise on the predation of ground dwelling prey. Greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis, for example, while often associated with deciduous forests, was found preferentially foraging in mature spruce monocultures with a high percentage of open ground in Germany, and intensively managed orchards and lowland forests with no undergrowth in Switzerland (Arlettaz 1999; Zahn et al. 2004). These studies collectively suggest that it is the forest structure that may be more important than tree species composition in many cases. Therefore, it seems clear that timber plantations have the potential to be of value to bats, but we lack an understanding of how populations of different species are affected by current silviculture practices."

126,120,0.3,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"â¢ Livelihood activities once secondary or only occasionally engaged in have recently become dominant in much of the lowermost Omo basin and northernmost Turkana region. Among the Dasanech, for example, some communities have long been agropastoral, practicing substantial flood recession agriculture in low lying, seasonally flooded areas along the Omo River or in the Omo delta. There is insufï¬cient rainfall in the lowermost Omo basin for rainfed agriculture, so that flood recession agriculture is all that is possible in the Omo region. The Kenyan government and a few aid agencies have funded small rainfall dependent agricultural projects in the dry plans of the northern Turkana segment (including near the lake), but the vast majority of these have failed. A small segment of Dasanech have long ï¬shed and hunted crocodile, as well (Fig. 4.3). Most Dasanech, however, sustained traditional pastoral lifeâuntil recently, that is, when major pressures on livestock herding necessitated vast numbers of households shifting to substantial, even major emphasis flood recession agriculture in the riverine zone. By the same token, agropastoralists, and even some pastoralists, have taken up ï¬shing in the lowermost river channels and northern waters of Lake Turkana. Thousands of Dasanech ï¬shers are now locked into intense competition with Turkana over remaining ï¬sh stocks in the lake. This conflict is undoubtedly intensiï¬ed by the Ethiopian governmentâs encouragement and subsidization of commercial ï¬shing operations in Kenyan lake watersâoperations that have far greater ï¬shing capacity due to their large and motorized boats. In northern Turkana, a parallel set of pressures on pastoral life has also intensiï¬ed in recent decades. As in Dasanech territory, inadequate rainfall in central and northern Turkana precludes rainfed agriculture and the shorelines of Lake Turkanaâs saline waters are also unsuitable for planting. As declining grazing conditions for livestock in the upland plains of Turkana have become dire in recent years, major numbers of northern Turkana householdsâoften entire villageâhave migrated toward Lake Turkana. As in the transboundary region more generally, massive numbers of Turkana livestock died during the extended drought between 2007 and 2010, for example, resulting in a major spike in herd lossesâa process initiated years earlier. Increasing numbers of Turkana stock ownersâeven entire villagesâbegan âmigratingâ from the plains toward the lakeâs northwestern shores (Fig. 4.4). Countless thousands of animals died during these treks, due to lack of water and graze. Tens of thousands of these once pastoral households have taken up ï¬shing, whether or not they have retained some livestock (Fig. 4.5). Hundreds of thousands of Turkana are now dependent on ï¬shing or ï¬shing related livelihood. They subsist only with access to sufï¬cient Lake Turkana waters and living resourcesâespecially ï¬sh. From this general migration pattern (Fig. 4.5), new ï¬shing and ï¬shing/pastoral villages have established along the northwestern shores of Lake Turkana, from the Ethiopia-Kenya border to Fergusonâs Gulf, and southward."
36,401,0.3,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"individuals. Nevertheless, the outbreak of Hendra increased the unpopularity of flying foxes in Australia, making conservation of the four native species challenging (Thiriet 2011). Unlike Hendra, Nipah virus has likely been acquired by humans via consumption of contaminated date palm sap (Luby et al. 2006; Rahman et al. 2012), followed by person-to-person transmission (Gurley et al. 2007). Although diseases associated with Hendra virus and Nipah virus have high mortality rates, the risk of infection for humans seems to be low (Chong et al. 2003), and countermeasures may be taken in order to prevent future spillover events (see Sect. 10.5.2). MERS, just as Hendra virus, apparently needs livestock as an amplifier host. In contrast to dromedaries (Hemida et al. 2014), seroprevalence of MERS seems to be low in bats (Memish et al. 2013), making direct transmission from bats to humans unlikely. As long as details on MERS infections in dromedaries and how to mitigate them are missing, it is hard to give recommendations to people who might be at risk. In contrast to MERS, the spillover of SARS into the human populations most likely happened via the wildlife market, either directly from a bat, or from other wildlife species. Likewise, the hunting, butchering and consumption of chimpanzees, gorillas and bats seem to have been sources of Ebola spillovers from wildlife to humans. The education of local communities needs to carefully balance information about the potential risk of acquiring infectious diseases by consuming bushmeat, without implying that bats need to be eradicated in order to prevent spillovers. The recent outbreak of Ebola resulting in several thousand human victims, and with bats frequently being reported as the likely source of origin, has undoubtly led to severe loss of reputation of bats on this continent, which makes the conservation of threatened populations and species even more challenging, not only in Africa, but also worldwide."

233,100,0.299,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Abstract Analysing extinction within a phylogenetic framework may seem counter-intuitive because extinction is a priori a non-heritable trait. However, extinction risk is correlated with other traits, such as body size, that show a strong phylogenetic signal. Further, there has been much effort in identifying key traits important for diversiï¬cation, and recent evidence has demonstrated that the processes of speciation and extinction may be inextricably linked. A phylogenetic approach also allows us to quantify the impact of extinction, for example, as the loss of branches from the tree-of-life. Early work suggested that extinctions might result in little loss of evolutionary history, but subsequent studies indicated that nonrandom extinctions might prune more of the evolutionary tree. Loss of phylogenetic diversity might have ecosystem consequences because functional differences between species tend to be correlated with the evolutionary distances between them. Here we explore how extinction prunes the tree-of-life. Our review indicates that the loss of evolutionary history under non-random extinction (the emerging pattern in extinction biology) might be less pronounced than some previous studies have suggested. However, the loss of functional diversity might still be large, depending on the evolutionary model of trait change. Under a punctuated model of evolution, in which trait differences accrue in bursts at speciation, the number of branches lost is more important than their summed lengths. We suggest that evolutionary models need to be incorporated more explicitly into measures of phylogenetic diversity if we are to use phylogeny as a proxy for functional diversity.

376,840,0.299,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Rangeland systems have coped or adapted to a wide range of past extreme events, lowering the risk of these events in the future. Risk is quantified as the product of the probability of occurrence of hazardous events and the impact of these events. Climate change could increase the risk of loss of rangeland ecosystem functions such as regeneration and recovery, soil development, and nutrient cycling, and the risk of loss of biodiversity including domestic as well as native plants and animal species. Climate change, coincident with resource management, could increase the risk of degradation or desertification. Future extreme weather events could enhance the risk of loss of infrastructure (buildings, fences, equipment, water systems), enterprise assets (livestock including genetic stock, resource productivity through soil erosion and degradation), and social networks (transportation, informational, and financial). While many risks can be identified, the challenge is to identify those risks that are most important to the sustainability of the socio-ecological system in the future. Key risks to rangelands are those that portend potentially adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability of societies and systems exposed. Identifying these types of climate-related risks involves framing the risk as resulting from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard (Fig. 15.4). Risks in this climate-related context are considered âkeyâ due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. In this framework, emergent risks, not previously considered, can arise from indirect impacts of climate change. For example, encouraging the production of bioenergy crops may decrease food security by reducing the land area producing food crops. The following are identified as key risks (Oppenheimer et al. 2014): risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings; risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semiarid regions; and risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for human livelihoods. Risk perception influences human behavior. Risk perception of owners and managers of rangeland systems builds from past management of drought, wildfire, and extreme heat; however, social considerations, rather than physical vulnerability to climate change (e.g., availability of water), are known to determine managersâ perception of the risk of climate change (Marx et al. 2007; Moser and Ekstrom 2010;"

Studies can be designed to determine the distribution and prevalence of ranavirus, the risk of introducing the pathogen into an uninfected area, and its possible effects on populations. Properly designed studies rely on a combination of field data, laboratory experiments, and quantitative analyses, which typically require teams of experts with adequate resources. The financial cost to assess the risk of ranaviruses can be substantial. For example, Project RANA (Risk assessment of new and emerging systemic iridoviral diseases for European fish and aquatic ecosystems) cost approximately 1.4 M â¬ (in 2012; Evira 2013). Similarly, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) is currently performing a surveillance study across seven US states for $178,000 (in 2014 USD; Smith et al. 2014).

169,155,0.299,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Hydropeaking effects on aquatic biota also depend on the interaction between hydrology and river morphology. Physical habitat diversity is important to ensure a sufï¬cient availability of different habitats for different life stages of aquatic organisms. Morphological alteration by channelization and bank ï¬xation are common pressures in alpine rivers (Comiti 2012; Muhar et al. 2000) and particularly impact river biota (Arscott et al. 2005; Kennedy and Turner 2011). Hydropeaking reinforces this effect and contributes, e.g., to a selection of speciï¬cally rheobiont macroinvertebrate taxa (Bretschko and Moog 1990; Cushman 1985; Graf et al. 2013), while limnophilic taxa tend to decrease. Besides macroinvertebrates early stages of many rheophilic ï¬sh species also prefer lateral habitats with reduced ï¬ow velocities (Moore and Gregory 1988) due to lower swimming capacity. If discharge increases during a hydropeaking event, a lateral habitat shift of the organisms is needed, either to avoid higher energy demands for maintaining their position or from getting displaced downstream. On the other hand, temporarily wetted habitats can represent deadly traps as macroinvertebrates, and ï¬shes frequently colonize these refugia during up-ramping phases and subsequently undergo stranding effects during down-ramping periods. Side channels, potholes, or low gradient bars have a greater stranding potential than homogenous channels with steep banks (Hunter 1992). Side channels may trap ï¬sh during the down-ramping phase (Bradford 1997), and potholes and low gradient bars also may lead to increased stranding during dewatering (Bauersfeld 1978; Bell et al. 2008; Auer et al. 2017), although they provide better habitats for young ï¬sh than channelized rivers (Schmutz et al. 2015).

Sediment quality in the northern Gulf of Mexico was rated overall as poor with 18 % of the coastal area rated poor. The sediment contaminant index was rated as fair and poor for 1 and 2 % of coastal area, respectively (Figure 4.10). This indicates that greater than approximately 97 % of coastal area had fewer than five sediment contaminant concentrations that exceeded ERL values, many fewer than in previous years. Most poor sediment quality ratings in 2000â2002 were due to measured sediment toxicity or elevated TOC concentrations, significantly different from pre-2001 data. Small-scale heterogeneity in the distributions of chemicals in sediments may explain differences in exceedances rates between assessments. Reductions in pesticide usage on adjacent land surfaces may contribute to these differences as well; however, pesticides are persistent in sediments and would be expected to reflect long-term accumulation rather than yearly differences in inputs (Kimbrough et al. 2008). The authors conclude that in coastal northern Gulf of Mexico, sediments had elevated concentrations of metals, pesticides, PCBs, and, occasionally, PAHs, but concentrations were mostly below ERL values. As noted above, ERL values used to classify sediment concentrations for Cr, Cu, Ni, and As are close to or less than natural background values so exceedances based on these criteria should be considered with caution."
222,5,0.299,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The idea that preserving the environment as an asset, rather than an impediment to economic and social development, is both very old and very new. For most of human history, at least until the start of the Industrial Revolution, the benefits humans derived from the rest of nature were well recognised and embedded in various cultural rules and norms. Parts of forests, lakes, wetlands or mountains were often deemed sacred and off limits. But it is no coincidence that these sacred natural assets also supplied essential life-support services for the communities involved. This is in stark contrast to the post-industrial view in much of the Western world that nature is merely a pretty pictureânice to enjoy if you can afford it but not essential to the more important business of âgrowing the economyâ. Too often, when the issue of conservation of the environment has entered public or political discussions, it has been purported to come at a cost, and the discussion has been framed as âthe environment versus the economyâ. Probably the most important contribution of the widespread recognition of ecosystem services is that it reframes the relationship between humans and the rest of nature to be more consistent with what we know. A better understanding of the role of ecosystem services emphasises our natural assets as critical ingredients to inclusive wealth, well-being and sustainability. Sustaining and enhancing human well-being requires a balance of all of our assetsâindividual people, society, the built economy and ecosystems. This reframing of the way we look at ânatureâ is essential to solving the problem of how to build a sustainable and desirable future for humanityâa goal that we all share. The ecosystem services concept makes it abundantly clear that the choice of âthe environment versus the economyâ is a false choice. If the environment contributes significantly to human well-being, then it is a major contributor to the real economy and the choice becomes how to manage all our assets, including natural and human-made capital, more effectively and sustainably (Costanza et al. 2000). Interest in ecosystem services in both the research and policy communities has grown rapidly (Braat and de Groot 2012). As of this writing, over 18,000 journal articles have been published on this topic, according to SCOPUS, and the number is growing exponentially. The most highly cited of these (with over 7,000 citations in SCOPUS as of this writing) is one that I and 12 co-authors published in Nature in 1997 that estimated"

255,356,0.299,Railway Ecology,"breeding success. The results suggest that the distribution of Black-winged Stilt between types of pond (feeders, evaporators and crystallizers) was not particularly affected by the construction. The major disturbance took place in the crystallizers, where the pillars were erected. However, as the results above show, these were the areas less used by the species, even in the pre-construction phase, which may be the reason why no impact was observed during the entire construction period and afterwards. Concerning nest phenology, the interruption of construction probably prevented an impact on the temporal distribution of nests. Likewise, this may explain why we did not ï¬nd any evidence that the railway affected hatching and survival of the fledglings that used impacted saltpans. During the wintering season, the usage of the saltpans can be conditioned by their availability, particularly by unpredictable fluctuations in the water level. Thus, the birds may be more limited in their choice of the saltpans, causing a high variability in the counts. This effect is more restricted during the breeding season due to the management of saltpans for the extraction of salt. During the last phase of this study, two saltpans (one impacted) were transformed into aquacultures, conditioning the use of the saltpans even more. Additionally, many of the shorebird species do not show a random distribution since they group for foraging or roosting, even if there is enough area to spread (van de Kamp et al. 2004). Even taking into account these sources of variability, the data suggest that the wintering community, as a whole, did show a negative response to the disturbance caused by the railway, since signiï¬cant differences were found between the two types of saltpans over the years, regarding the speciesâ abundance. Nevertheless, although the use of a pooled number of individual birds allowed the analysis of data that is inherently over-dispersed and zero-inflated, it restricts the full interpretation of the data. On the other hand, the distribution of the main wintering species was not affected, while for the wintering Dunlin, the number of birds in each activity did not show a response to the disturbance caused by the railway. Disturbances can inhibit foraging activities in favor of vigilant behaviour, but since all saltpans are close to sources of human disturbance (e.g., roads), the effect of the railway may have been buffered."

Population-based surveys can offer a way of assessing the overall health of a population (e.g., Rathod et al. 2016). The objective of this section is to use longitudinal population-level data on mortality collected as part of the LSMS in Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda to investigate the association between functional difficulty, on the one hand, and short term mortality, on the other.

260,369,0.299,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"The above statistical approaches classify infection as binary; an individual is infected or not. However, infection can be thought of as a continuum from subclinical to clinical infections, where the latter is resulting in disease and possibly mortality (Miller et al. 2015). Quantitative PCR and cell culture-based methods (e.g., plaque assays and TCID50) are common techniques to estimate viral titers in tissue (Miller et al. 2015). Inasmuch as viral titers in tissues correlate with the severity of infection, these data provide additional insight into the possible effects of ranavirus on populations. Consider, for instance, measuring ranavirus prevalence and titers through time in a population of a tolerant species (e.g., American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus; Hoverman et al. 2011). One might observe that the prevalence of ranavirus was quite high, but titers were very low. If changing conditions (e.g., rising temperatures) were hypothesized to make this species more susceptible, then one would expect to see viral titers increase with increasing temperature, while prevalence of infection would remain unchanged. Vital titers are often reported as log10-transformed values of virus concentration per unit of genomic DNA or tissue. Such transformed titers are generally normally distributed, which are suitable for simple linear models (i.e., regression, analysis of variance). For example, the relationship discussed above could be tested with a linear regression of viral titers on temperature. Because the log of zero is undefined, it is common practice to add one or a number representing the minimum detectable level to all numbers including zero before taking the log. If there are many zeros (i.e., individuals that tested negative) in the dataset, the resulting distribution will not be normal. However, if you are interested in the distribution of titers in infected animals only, it is appropriate to exclude the"

The individuals they turn out to be is the consequence of the interaction between this genetic makeup and their life experiences. In a few cases, life experiences have no bearing on some important features, such as sex. In most cases though, the path is highly uncertain and strongly dependent on life experiences. Mounting causal evidence indicates that early experiences often have persistent, long-lasting, and significant effects on a wide array of important youth and adult outcomes. First, since developing countries have few mechanisms to cope with risk, environmental and economic shocksâsuch as severe weather, epidemiological events, or armed conflictâcan generate long-lasting negative effects, usually by way of their impact on nutrition.9 For example, Maccini and Yang (2009) look at the effect of rainfall in the Philippines; Almond (2006) studies the persistent impact of the Spanish influenza of 1918 in the United States; and Akresh and others (2012) analyze the effect of growing up during the Nigerian civil war."

36,616,0.299,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"13.6.3 Education of Growers and the Public Apart from research into damage mitigation methods, there is also an urgent need to educate fruit growers and increase their awareness on the ecological and economic importance of pteropodid bats. Huang et al. (2014) found that in Sumatra, less than 20 % of coffee growers interviewed (n = 16) were aware that bats were pollinators, and none were aware that bats dispersed seeds. As demonstrated by Bumrungsri et al. (2008, 2009), pteropodids are major pollinators for some commercially important fruit trees, even when the bats may not be the most frequent visitors. In northern Queensland, P. conspicillatus plays a vital role in rainforest reproduction through pollination, and although these bats may affect the fruit industry, there has never been a full study of the economic value of flying foxes as pollinators of eucalypt hardwood forests in Australia. The majority of timber trees harvested on the east coast produce nectar and pollen only at night (P. Birt, unpublished). This means that as flying fox populations decrease, fewer timber trees will join the logging cycle. More importantly, pteropodid bats play a major role in seed dispersal. The further that a fruit is dispersed from the parent tree, the greater the chance of any resulting seedlings surviving to maturity. Fighting over feeding territories (the squabbling heard at night) leads to the loser departing with a fruit in its mouth, and consuming it at a distance. This has been termed the âraiders versus residentsâ seed dispersal model (Richards 1990), tested by McConkey and Drake (2006) in Tonga, where they showed that once numbers of flying foxes declined below a threshold where there was no conflict over feeding territories, then seed dispersal away from the parent tree ceased. Therefore, while economic estimates of fruit loss are an important first step in quantifying the problem of crop damage, a costâbenefit analysis that takes into account the positive economic impact of ecosystem services provided by the same bat species (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal to maintain healthy forests) is needed. The resulting data must be shared and communicated to growers and orchardists. They will form a crucial component in mitigating conflict, as at least one example from an Australian orchardist shows that ignorance can lead to opinions that the ecological role of flying foxes is negligible. The orchardist claimed to have seen no evidence that flying foxes are essential to forests (Bicknell 2002). This shows that in some cases, feeding on fruit crops can create a negative bias"

231,956,0.298,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"and Sparks 1999) and migration (Cotton 2003) have been most widely reported, since adjusting timing is a flexible way to alter the climatic conditions experienced. If birds cannot alter their timing sufï¬ciently or climate change makes historically adaptive cues maladaptive, then populations may suffer (Visser 2008). Focusing on coastal birds, there appears to be no general pattern in how timing of egg laying has responded, with for example northern lapwings Vanellus vanellus showing no response over the past decades, while egg laying in Eurasian oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus advanced in response to increased rainfall, and in ringed plovers Charadrius hiaticula advanced in response to rising temperatures (Crick and Sparks 1999). Studies have also identiï¬ed various cases where interannual variability in demographic rates was associated with climatic variability. The most common pattern is that annual juvenile and/or adult survival is strongly positively related to winter temperatures in many coastal birds (e.g. Peach et al. 1994; Yalden and Pearce-Higgins 1997; Atkinson et al. 2000). By contrast, a review has suggested that populations"

36,529,0.298,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.7.5 Regulated Hunting In many areas where hunted bats are threatened, hunters do not want to extirpate bat populations, but they also do not want to lose the ability to hunt bats (Mildenstein 2012; Cawthorn and Hoffman 2015). In fact, some roost site protection campaigns are successful, because hunting outside the roost site is not discussed or prohibited, making it easier for hunters to respect roost site sanctuaries (T. Mildenstein pers. obs.; SOS 2012). Once communities understand that human disturbance has population-level impacts and that conservation management must balance negative impacts with the batsâ innate ability to add to their population, community-level planning of a sustainable hunting program can ensue. Targets must be established for minimum population sizes and numbers of viable populations before hunting can be allowed. After thresholds are reached, sustainable harvest levels must be determined using adaptations of the well-developed harvest management practices for other species. Finally, an effective enforcement and harvest regulation program must be designed that starts out conservatively, carefully tracking impacts of hunting on bat populations and making adjustments to hunting allowances as needed. Halstead (1977) described how regulated hunting of E. helvum at the University of Ile Ife in south western Nigeria can be mutually beneficial to the bat population, local community livelihoods, and managers of property where roosts are present. In places where hunting laws are in place but not respected or enforced, education and outreach are instrumental in garnering public support (as Madagasikara Voakajy has done for roosts of P. rufus in Madagascar)."
169,278,0.298,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"3. Fish usually migrate within the main current or, in the case of too high ï¬ow velocities, parallel to it. Furthermore, the migration corridor (i.e. surface vs. bottom-oriented and shoreline vs. open water) depends on species-speciï¬c preferences (Seifert 2012). Bypasses have to be directly connected to migration corridors of all relevant species, and attraction ï¬ows should enhance their traceability. Facilities for Upstream Migration Several guidance documents on planning, construction and operation of ï¬sh passes were already developed or are currently under development (Dumont et al. 2005; BMLFUW 2012; Seifert 2012; Schmutz and Mielach 2013, 2015; DWA 2014). As upstream migrations mostly serve reproduction, facilities have to support at least sexually mature age classes. Three main aspects have to be considered: (1) the perceptibility of the entry, (2) the passability of the ï¬sh pass and (3) post-passage effects. Perceptibility depends to a high degree on the position and attraction ï¬ow of the ï¬sh pass entry. In general, it should directly link the ï¬sh pass to the natural migration corridor of ï¬sh and therefore be located close to the barrier, the main current (for hydropower plants, this means close to the turbines) and the shoreline. For oblique weirs, the pointed angle of the weir proved to be advantageous. For bottom-dwelling ï¬sh, a continuous connection to the river bottom is required (e.g. by a ramp with rough substrate and a slope <1:2). Success may depend on a combination of several factors: multiple entries or collection galleries to cover wide barriers (>100 m), varying water levels and several species with different migration corridors and/or swimming capabilities. The attraction ï¬ow has to provide a continuous connection between the migration corridors up- and downstream of the barrier. It should be as parallel as possible to the main current (e.g. <30 ), cause no turbulences and provide a high impulse of ï¬ow (deï¬ned as the product of volume and ï¬ow velocity; Larinier 2002; Seifert 2012). While the ï¬ow velocity is limited by the speciesâ swimming capabilities, the volume can be further increased. At least 1â5% of the turbined ï¬ow are required as attraction ï¬ow (Larinier 2002; Dumont et al. 2005). In many cases, the operational discharge, which only serves the passability of the ï¬sh pass, is too low and has to be enhanced by additional ï¬ow introduced into the lowest part of the ï¬sh pass. In this case, the installation of attraction ï¬ow turbines can reduce energetic losses (Hassinger 2009a; Seifert 2012). Passability of a ï¬sh pass is ensured, if it provides a suitable migration corridor for all relevant species. This is the case when (a) hydraulic conditions do not exceed swimming capabilities, (b) the minimum rheoactive ï¬ow velocity is provided, (c) the spatial dimensions and geometry (depth, width and length) allow adult ï¬sh of the size-decisive species (i.e. species with highest spatial demands) to pass the entire ï¬sh pass and (d) continuous rough substrate supports bottom-dwelling and weaker species by ensuring moderate ï¬ow velocities towards the bottom. With regard to post-passage effects, ï¬sh should be able to continue their migration (without the risk of downstream drift) and ï¬nd suitable habitats. As"

222,89,0.298,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Assets, income, nutrition- and blood pressure-related health indicators and subjective well-being vary with location. Waterlogging, high salinity and access are significantly associated with poverty in the study area with different spatial patterns apparent for these three variables (see Chap. 21 and Amoako Johnson et al. 2016). Soil salinity is significantly associated with poverty around the Sundarbans, waterlogging in the centre of the study area, while the lack of access dominates in the east of the study area. For example, the factors associated with asset poverty vary across the study area. Considering all social-ecological systems, the probability of being materially and subjectively poor decreases as household dependence on ecosystem services for income increases. However, the irrigated agricultural zone showed the opposite relationship, with increasing dependence on ecosystem services being associated with a higher probability of being materially poor. Similar spatial and social-ecological system-based differences are found in the health indicators (Chap. 27) and in how individuals perceive their own well-being. Levels of malnourishment are higher than the national average but vary across the study area. For example, food consumption varies across the study area and by social-ecological system. Irrigated agriculture areas show the lowest protein intake and one of the lowest calorie intakes. In comparison, households living in the char and rain-fed agricultural social-ecological systems also have low calorie intake levels, but the protein consumption (from fish) is much higher and child undernutrition lower. This indicates that fish consumption appears crucial to health in some social-ecological system."

233,541,0.298,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Methods and Materials Islands are an ideal system to examine, because they are spatially segregated, but are also of importance, as they are home to many potentially important species under threat (Steadman 1995). We assume islands are associated with a greater ED than mainland areas, since islands are more isolated and therefore should be more likely to accumulate ED than other landforms. We already know that island area correlates with phylogenetic structure (Cardillo et al. 2008), and we too found a correlation between island size and ED. The next logical question then is how could we quantify the different islands, with respect to species and each islandâs overall community. We take the ED score of mammal species on islands, and then calculate the Î»M of every patch within a speciesâ distribution to prioritise spatially among the island patches. Metapopulation theory suggests that a population made up of smaller populations with potential gene ï¬ow might better persist than otherwise expected when considering each population alone and individually. Thus, distributions made up of closer, larger islands would be better off because of the increased probability of dispersal and rescue effect."
219,539,0.298,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"expansion into forests and other higher value biomes. This also requires reforestation and other restoration efforts. Argentina faces great challenges ahead regarding the protection of wetlands, addressing the ecological imbalance caused by wetland degradation through LUCC, especially urbanization and waste-disposal of coastal cities. The case studies also revealed the potential of promising strategies that could achieve sustainable land management. Sheep production in Patagonia is experiencing land degradation but the rotational grazing system designed by INTA (TME) has been shown to be sustainable but its adoption rate is low. Increasing its adoption would require concerted efforts to provide extension services, incentives, and support that could help ranchers to overcome the high upfront costs. The incentives and material support could be justiï¬ed by the ecosystem beneï¬ts that result from rangeland management. The case studies in La Paz, and La Rioja also reveal that diversiï¬ed crop-livestock systems are more sustainable and proï¬table and reduce production risks than specialized production systems. In the case of the SW Buenos Aires Province however, specialized pasture management does offer more sustainable and proï¬table production systems crop production. But farmers practice mixed systems as a strategy to contend with production and market risks. Conservation agriculture also need to extend beyond the soybean production. This is especially important in dry areas affected by wind erosion. For example the study in Buenos Aires showed that 30 % of vegetation cover reduces wind erosion by 80 %. This will simultaneously increase agricultural productivity and reduce dust storms in cities and other heavily populated areas. Argentina has laid out elaborate land use planning strategies, land degradation and improvement monitoring that informs policy formulation. This was a result of political efforts which were strongly backed by FAOâs land degradation assessment (LADA) that was completed in 6 different countries. The countries could learn from Argentinaâs groundbreaking initiative of establishing an elaborate monitoring and evaluation of land degradation and improvement. It is therefore that Argentina started to share its knowledge in this ï¬eld through its Technical Cooperation Facility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ((FOAR), through which LADA experts of the Secretary of Environment and Sustainable Development gave training to institutions and farmers in other Latin-American countries. The world has a lot to learn from Argentina given its rapid poverty reduction and successful adoption rate of CA using public-private partnership. For Argentina to maintain its economic and social development, it will need to work harder to address its growth-related environmental challenges that affect the poor the most. Argentina of today is much better prepared to face these challenges and take advantage of the emerging opportunities. This study will provide policy makers with empirical evidence to take action against land degradation.

232,370,0.298,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"dynamic adaption to our ever-changing world, whether driven by environmental, technological, societal, health, or other causes. The concept of resilience often appears provocative to the public, as it implies the possibility for more disruptions or accidents to happen. However, this is exactly what has to be realized: the fact that there is a ï¬nite probability for events with potentially disastrous consequences to happen. We need to enhance our resilience in order to be better prepared so we can minimize the physical and âmeasurableâ impact as well as the psychological and emotional health impact. Only an informed public and educated decision-makers are able to provide an effective response to a disruption. The necessity for a better-informed public on advanced technologies or more broadly for a âtechnologically literate citizenâ is not new [9]. As we can see, for example, from the events associated with Fukushima, in the discussion about vaccinations or genetically modiï¬ed organisms (GMOs) the public, particularly in the United States but also globally, is susceptible to a perceived risk, rather than a factual risk. Unfortunately, the concept of risk is not well understood in the public and therefore, any discussion about risk is dominated by the potential impact of an event, rather than both the impact and the probability of an event. As a matter of fact, the likelihood for a disastrous event to happen is often neglected. The misperception of the concept of risk in the public is compounded by the fact that the potential impact can easily be used in the media to capture attention and increase readership. In addition, social networks are becoming one of the main venues for communications and distribution of information without any review and vetting of information. The fact that social networks operate instantaneously does not help conventional media to convey information that has been vetted and therefore, is always delayed. The delayed release of vetted information by conventional means also increases the potential for early spread of misinformation, which can be difï¬cult to combat after the fact. Regarding the contentious issue of GMOs, the risk of potential side effects overwhelms the discussion about the beneï¬ts in the public. While there is no scientiï¬c evidence supporting any claims of detrimental side effects of GMOs in the modiï¬cation of approved food [10, 11], social media is dominated by claims of disastrous effects on animals and human consumers. Not only is a large portion of the animal feed in the US already genetically modiï¬ed [12] without any obvious effect, GMOs need to play a critical role in addressing the enormous and expanding malnutrition in many developing countries speciï¬cally in Africa or India [13]. The development and utilization of vaccines have prevented devastating epidemics decimating whole communities and regions in the past. While vaccination is associated with a small health risk, this risk is insigniï¬cant in comparison to the risk of foregoing vaccinations. Recent increases in measles epidemics in the US reflect the emerging challenges by experts to convince the public about the beneï¬ts vs. the risk associated with vaccination [14]. The opposition to GMOs or vaccination is largely driven by the misperception of risk, as the general public often overestimates the detrimental effects and underestimates or is not aware of the beneï¬ts and the effects of not adopting these technologies. GMOs have another challenge in that it is a new and advanced"
167,219,0.298,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"In order to introduce ecosystem-based approach to fishery management in longterm perspective, it is necessary to modify the higher education both in specialized and general universities by introducing relevant courses into the curriculum. At the same time, there are also approaches that do not rely on governmental funding. In particularly, environmental non-governmental organizations, such as the World Wildlife Fund, actively operating in Russia, traditionally play active role in the education of general public. The understanding of the importance of the fisheries sustainability is too weak now in the society, and special effort is required to improve that. Public education towards consuming sustainable seafood began only few years ago by publication of the first seafood consumer guide in Russian (Lajus et al. 2010). Other publications on sustainable fisheries were devoted to principles of ecological certification (Spiridonov and Zgurovsky 2003), illegal fishing of Kamchatka salmon (Dronova and Spiridonov 2008), comparison of consequences of long-line and bottom trawl fishing (Grekov and Pavlenko 2011), critical analysis of Russian fisheries against provisions of Code of conduct of responsible fisheries (Zgurovsky et al. 2013) and analysis of fisheries-related threats to the Arctic ecosystem (Bokhanov et al. 2013). In short-term perspective, one approach is the introduction of ecological certifications. Among a number of existing certification systems, the most demanded is a voluntary certification according to the standards of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). MSC develops standards for certification, and the certification itself is performed by an independent company. Certified fisheries obtain marked advantages. MSC program is quite well established in Europe and North America, but comparatively new for Russia with its very different civil and expert structures. By now, in total 15 fisheries are certified, and among them are the fisheries described in this chapter. Only fisheries that deal with export production participate in the program, because of absence of demand on certified fish on the Russian market. Participation in the MSC program requires all participants â company managers, governmental authorities, researchers, independent experts âvery profound understanding of its standards, consisting of three principles: maintenance of healthy status of target species, limited ecosystem effect of fishing operations, and effective"
291,83,0.298,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"change in life expectancy only due to the change in mortality at this given age x. The second part is the sum of an indirect effect and an interaction effect (Preston et al. 2001, p. 64). A geometric explanation might help to understand what is meant by this second component as it often appears to be confusing: Life expectancy can be interpreted as the area under the survival curve. In case of a decline in mortality at age x at time point t the survival curve at this age is higher than at time point t 1. This is meant by the direct effect. For the sake of simplicity, letâs assume that mortality only changed at age x. Nevertheless, the survival curve will be also higher at age x C 1: A survival curve where the survival at age x C 1 was at the same level as at t 1 would require an increase in mortality. This âwakeâ of a change in mortality at one age affecting the survival function at subsequent ages is estimated by the second component. We followed exactly the same procedure as in Chap. 5 to obtain the required death rates: Raw death rates, based on death counts and corresponding exposure times from the Human Mortality Database (HMD, 2017), were smoothed assuming Poisson distributed death counts using Camardaâs MortalitySmooth package (Camarda 2012, 2015). The life table functions lx , Lx , and Tx were estimated using the approach outlined in Chapter 3 of Preston et al. (2001). The values for ax , the mean duration lived at age x by those who died at age x, were taken from the HMD. While any kind of difference in calendar time could be used, we decided to estimate the age-specific contributions within an interval of ten years. I.e., we compared 1960 to 1950, 1961 to 1951, . . . . The years on the x-axis in Figs. 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, 8.12, and 8.13 refer to the latter time point. Thus, the values at any age x in year 1980 denote the contribution of changing mortality at age x between 1970 and 1980. The choice of a ten year difference is, of course, arbitrary but it allowed us also to express the contribution in âmeaningfulâ units: We used days and weeks andâin exceptional cases of substantial improvements or deterioriation in survivalâmonths. The surface maps were plotted using a terrain color scheme: Green indicates moderate contributions to life expectancy. When the color turns to brown, that age alone contributed at least one week to the increase in life expectancy during the decade of observation. Very bright brown areas depict contributions of one month or more. Blue colors denote negative contributions. Just like deeper shades of blue suggests lower depths below sea level on geographic maps, they indicate here changes in age-specific mortality that bring life expectancy down. Again, we have not included the whole set of countries from the HMD but rather a subset of countries with rather peculiar features, which we already pointed at in previous chapters."

232,41,0.298,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"1 Introduction The French word dommage (damage) has several translations into English. Two are of particular interest: ï¬rst, it is the partial or total physical destruction of a living being (ranging from physical injury to death) or an object, due to an accident; second, it represents loss, as in the expression âitâs a pityâ or âwhat a pityâ. This polysemy makes it difï¬cult to create an empirical concept in the sense of a class of objects that can be characterized by the elements that compose it. But why even try? Because a deeper understanding of the anthropological meaning of damage can help to identify social dynamics that receive little attention in classical risk prevention studies [1]. In practice, the word appears to designate both the consequences of a disaster, and the losses suffered by humans and non-humans which are serious enough for it to be asserted that the disaster must not happen again. In this case, taking damage and its dynamics into account can help to go beyond the simple issue of loss. D. Pecaud UniversitÃ© de Nantes, Nantes, France D.

231,756,0.297,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"This chapter presents a review of what is known about the impacts of climate change on the biota (plankton, benthos, ï¬sh, seabirds and marine mammals) of the North Sea. Examples show how the changing North Sea environment is affecting biological processes and organisation at all scales, including the physiology, reproduction, growth, survival, behaviour and transport of individuals; the distribution, dynamics and evolution of populations; and the trophic structure and coupling of ecosystems. These complex responses can be detected because there are detailed long-term biological and environmental records for the North Sea; written records go back 500 years and archaeological records many thousands of years. The information presented here shows that the composition and productivity of the North Sea marine ecosystem is clearly affected by climate change and that this will have consequences for sustainable levels of harvesting and other ecosystem services in the future. Multi-variate ocean climate indicators that can be used to monitor and warn of changes in composition and productivity are now being developed for the North Sea."

However, FV3-like ranaviruses have been isolated from captive fishes on several occasions. A ranavirus displaying 98â99 % nucleotide identity to FV3 over a portion of the major capsid gene has been reported among cultured marbled sleeper goby (Oxyeleotris marmoratus) in Thailand (Prasankok et al. 2005). Furthermore, FV3 outbreaks have impeded efforts to restore populations of the critically endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the Missouri River Basin of the USA (Waltzek et al. 2014). High-mortality epizootics were reported among young-of-the-year pallid sturgeon in 2001, 2009, and 2013 at the Blind Pony Hatchery in Sweet Springs, Missouri, USA (Chinchar and Waltzek 2014; Waltzek et al. 2014). Experimental transmission of the 2009 isolate recreated the same high-mortality disease in naÃ¯ve juvenile pallid sturgeon following bath exposure (Waltzek et al. 2014). Furthermore, an FV3 strain isolated from moribund hatchery-reared Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii) was found to be lethal to both Russian and lake (A. fluvescens) sturgeon following intraperitoneal injection (Waltzek et al. 2014). Finally, an FV3-like ranavirus was isolated from juvenile white sturgeon (A. transmontanus) on a California, USA, farm during an unusual mortality event in 1998 (Waltzek et al. 2014). Experimental transmission studies using FV3-like viruses isolated from a diversity of ectothermic vertebrate classes have been shown to infect black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), northern pike, pike-perch, mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), although little or no mortality was observed in these species (Gobbo et al. 2010; Bang-Jensen et al. 2009, 2011a, b; Brenes et al. 2014a). Similarly, recent North American fish health surveys resulted in the isolation of FV3 from healthy appearing fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), walleye (Sander vitreus), and northern pike (Waltzek et al. 2014). Although preliminary, these data suggest that imperiled sturgeon may be predisposed to infections with FV3-like viruses; whereas, other fishes may simply act as viral carriers or dead-end hosts.

However, caridean shrimps, particularly the Hippolytidae, are reported to be among the most abundant crustaceans within SAV in the major lagoonal systems of the southwestern GoM (Negreiros-Fransozo et al. 1996). Also, the diets of common fishes, such as the sparid Lagodon rhomboides and the batrachoidid Opsanus phobetron, from GoM lagoons along the YucataÌn Peninsula include caridean shrimps, presumably Hippolytidae or Palaemonidae (Canto-Maza and Vega-Cendejas 2007, 2008). Consequently, it is reasonable to infer that natant decapod crustaceans may be of greater importance among the nekton assemblages of seagrass meadows in the southern GoM than suggested by the literature on fish assemblages from these systems. Seagrass meadows have different trophic dynamics than other coastal wetland habitats in that seagrass primary production is consumed by some nekton as both live and dead (detritus) material (Heck and Valentine 2006), whereas the trophic role of emergent marsh plant production in the support of nekton populations is largely through a detrital pathway in marshes and the role of mangrove primary production may not contribute significantly to trophic support of nekton (Beck et al. 2001). Some nekton, such as the pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) (Livingston 1982; Montgomery and Targett 1992) and a few larger nektonic herbivores, such as green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) and manatees (Trichechus manatus) consume live seagrass and contribute to recycling of nutrients and maintenance of seagrass productivity (Thayer et al. 1984; Heck and Valentine 2006). Seagrass meadows have long been recognized as important foraging sites for the juveniles of predatory fishes, especially members of the Sciaenidae (drums) and Lutjanidae (snappers) (Gilmore 1987; McMichael and Peters 1989; Rutherford et al. 1989; Rooker et al. 1999), but these species are commonly found in other coastal wetlands as well, and so are not characteristic of seagrass meadows per se. The smaller species of fishes, such as members of the Gobiidae and Fundulidae (especially Lucania parva) and natant decapods such as shrimps in the family Hippolytidae, are widely distributed and abundant in seagrass habitats within all regions of the GoM (Table 6.20). Many members of the Syngnathidae (pipefishes), such as the dwarf seahorse (Hippocampus zosterae) (Figure 6.107b) and fringed pipefish (Anarchopterus criniger) are even more dependent upon seagrass habitats within the GoM and have been identified by some as species of special concern (Beck et al. 2000). It has been suggested that the refuge value of seagrass structure is a key feature in maintaining these assemblages of smaller nekton (Heck et al. 2003)."

Beaked whales for example feed down to depths of 1 km (0.62 mi) preying on squid and mid-water fishes. The Gulf of Mexico has been considered a distinct geographic region (Backus et al. 1977) on the basis of the lanternfish species distributions in the Sargasso Sea and the Caribbean. Out of about 209 species known to occur in the western Sargasso and Caribbean Sea complex (Gartner et al. 1988; Sutton and Hopkins 1996), approximately 140 have been sampled in the Gulf of Mexico. Bangma and Haedrich (2008) have suggested that the Gulf mid-water fishes be considered an ecotone or transition between the subtropical Atlantic and tropical faunas because the Gulf of Mexico has a mixture of species from both the north Atlantic and Caribbean. In any case, the mid-water fish play a significant role in the transfer of mass and energy up the food web to larger open-ocean pelagic species (Hopkins and Baird 1977; Hopkins et al. 1996). The deep Gulf of Mexico between about 1,500 m (4,921 ft) and 3,700 m (12,139 ft) is very poorly sampled to date. A biomass of 4.5 mg ww/m3 (standard deviation Â¼ 1.9) between the 1,500 and 3,700 m (4,921 and 12,139 ft) depth can be estimated based on the work of Sutton et al. (2008) in the central Atlantic. This would be the equivalent of about 12 g ww/m2 between 1.4 and 3.7 km (0.87 and 2.3 mi) in depth. Much of our knowledge of deep macroplankton or micronekton is not quantitative in terms of numbers or biomass per volume. However, extensive information is available on the number of species (Gamma diversity) of the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent Caribbean. This is due to the exploratory fishing of the NMFS (now within NOAA) (Springer and Bullis 1956; Bullis and Thompson 1965). Summaries of catches of oplophorid shrimps (Decapoda: Caridea: Oplophoridae) by Pequegnat and Wicksten (2006) illustrate the wide geographic and depth distributions of this diverse group caught in mid-water trawls and bottom-trawled nets. Of the 25 species they reviewed, 21 were sampled in the water column. Mesopelagic micronekton standing stocks (Hopkins and Lancraft 1984; Sutton and Hopkins 1996) and composition (Hopkins et al. 1989) assessments are available for the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Figure 7.51). The latter authors have constructed an energy budget for a typical mid-water fish species that defines their importance in consuming upper water column"
284,379,0.297,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Social movements opposing mining activities claim that developing mining activities jeopardizes local (and supralocal) livelihoods. Communities in Peru, Guatemala, Colombia and Ecuador signal the risks to their livelihoods, which are dependent on agriculture, cattle and forests. Concerns about health also appear, with high relevance in Esquel (Argentina) regarding cyanide use. Worries about water quality, and availability for local economic activities and household use, are common to all studied cases. While the affected communities signal such concerns as grounds to redraft or even stop a mining project and national mining plans, governments and companies claim that these decisions are not for local communities to make. Central governments argue that mining is an issue of national interest and experts within a national decision-making process should have the last word. Governments and mining companies frame local alarm as an exaggeration that undermines the positive impacts of mining. Moreover, critical communitiesâ and EJMâs views are being labelled by Latin American national governments as irrational, ignorant, anti-development, politically driven, promoted by foreignersâ interests or by a radical, subversive environmentalism (Bebbington, 2012b), hand in hand with criminalization processes (OCMAL, 2011). Ofï¬cial participation arenas become frustrating spaces given the partial information that is shared and the powerless participation modes they offer (Cole and Foster, 2001). As decision-making procedures are unable to address local communitiesâ concerns, disputes form around these procedures and their decisions (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Suryanata and Umemoto, 2005; Walter and MartinezAlier, 2010; Urkidi and Walter, 2011). It is becoming increasingly common for EJMs to prevent or boycott public audiences, as these are seen as an empty requisite for project approval (Jahncke Benavente and Meza, 2010). There were cases of boycotts of public audiences in Tambogrande, Toquepala, TÃ­a MarÃ­a, Esquel and Loncopue. Indigenous communities rejected and misrecognized the alleged consultation processes led by mining companies and governments in Peru, Colombia and Guatemala. In Ecuador and Argentina, indigenous communities claimed that formal consultation never occurred (Urkidi and Walter, 2011; PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). Furthermore, one of the ï¬ndings of this research has been the role played by violence in the fostering of consultations. Human Rights claims have been identiï¬ed as a particular root of Latin American EJMs (Carruthers, 2008). Mining referenda have emerged in contexts of repression and criminalization of activists, where concerns regarding the physical and psychological integrity of activists were rising. In this"

Sea-level rise in the twenty-first century is projected to be in the range of 0.5â1.7 m with associated impacts of increased flooding depth, area and maximum wave height. Other changes are less certain, but could include increased stratification, small changes in biological production and alterations in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. For the people of coastal Bangladesh, the sea is both a support and a threat. Marine fisheries ecosystem services provide a vital contribution to livelihood and to diet, while flooding associated with storm surge events has regularly caused devastation. This chapter describes the current biophysical situation in the northern Bay of Bengal and the factors influencing change, while Chap. 25 presents the future prospects for fisheries as projected in this research. The research is also linked to Chap. 8 which discusses flooding from both rivers and the sea and Chap. 16 which discusses possible changes in tropical cyclones and coastal flooding."
151,319,0.297,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Oral gavage and dietary studies have been conducted to determine the acute effects of CPY on birds (Table 4). Data on toxicity of CPY to birds were reviewed previously (Solomon et al. 2001) and in the sections that follow, only studies that have been conducted since that review are discussed. Hubbard and Beavers (2008) administered CPY by oral gavage at 21.6 mg ai kgâ1 bwt to 19-wk old northern bobwhite (C. virginianus) using corn oil as a vehicle and observed signs of toxicity (Hubbard and Beavers 2008). The effects included a ruffled appearance and lethargy. Signs of toxicity were more prevalent and occurred sooner at higher doses. Reduced consumption of food was observed at doses â¥36 mg ai kgâ1 bwt. The acute oral 14-d LD50 was >60 mg ai kgâ1 bwt, as only 30% mortality occurred at this dose, the largest tested. The no-mortality dose was 36 mg ai kgâ1 bwt and the NOEL was 13 mg ai kgâ1 bwt. The acute oral toxicity of Lorsban 50W was determined by exposing northern bobwhite (C. virginianus) (Kaczor and Miller 2000). Twenty-two-wk old birds were dosed once with Lorsban 50W (50.5% purity) and observed for 14-d. Food consumption, body weight, signs of toxicity, and lethality were monitored throughout the observation period. In the group fed the greatest dose (121 mg ai kgâ1 bwt), all birds died within 24 h of dosing. During the first day or two following dosing, consumption of food by birds exposed to CPY was less that of the controls. However, rates of food consumption quickly returned to those of control birds and, as a result, there was no significant decrease in body weight over the study period for any of the treatment groups. The most prevalent sign of toxicity was lethality. The only other observed sign of toxicity was lethargy and it usually preceded lethality. Necropsies of dead birds revealed gaseous intestines. The LD50 was 35.9 mg ai kgâ1 bwt, the NOEC was 7.6 mg ai kgâ1 bwt and the LOEC was 15.2 mg ai kgâ1 bwt. In other studies, the toxicity of CPY in a variety of formulations was evaluated. These formulations included Lorsban 2.5P (2.48% ai, Brewer et al. 2000b), Lorsban 10.5 LEE (10.5% ai, Brewer et al. 2000a), GF-1668 (18.7% ai, Gallagher and Beavers 2006), and Lorsban Advanced (41.1% ai, Hubbard and Beavers 2008). The lowest LD50 from these studies was 12.6 mg ai kgâ1 bwt (Brewer et al. 2000a) and the smallest NOEL was <4 mg ai kgâ1 bwt (Hubbard and Beavers 2008). To determine the importance of duration of acute exposure on a daily basis, 25-wk old northern bobwhite (C. virginianus) were pre-conditioned to feed during either a 1- or 8-h period each day (Gallagher and Beavers 2007). Following the pre-conditioning period, the birds were offered food treated with CPY for either 1 or 8 h for 1-d. The birds were observed for 7-d after treatment. Rate of food consumption and body mass decreased with increasing dietary concentration of CPY in both treatment groups. Greater toxicity was observed in the group feeding for only 1 h each day. This result suggests that birds being exposed over an 8-h period had longer to metabolize and detoxify CPY. LD50 values were 75 mg ai kgâ1 bwt for birds receiving their total dose in 1 h and 116 mg ai kgâ1 bwt for those receiving the dose over an 8-h period. LC50 values were 3,697 and 6,986 mg ai kgâ1 diet for birds"

After European settlers had built thousands of milldams between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, 1â5 m of slack water sedimentation had covered the ï¬oodplains and the present meandering river channels incised in these sediments (Walter and Merritts 2008). The impacts of weirs, especially on ï¬sh migration, have been known and addressed for centuries (see Chaps. 6 and 9). In preindustrial times, when harmonizing various river uses on local scales was a necessity, ï¬nding compromise was key. Although neither historical observations nor ï¬shery records have been kept, this is evident from water legislation. A Scottish statute of 1214 demanded, for instance, openings in dams, and all barrier nets had to be lifted on Saturdays to allow salmon runs (Salmo salar, Hoffmann 1996). A ï¬shing decree from 1545 for the Austrian Traisen River, a right-hand tributary of the Danube, provides similar protections for potamodromous ï¬sh species (Raab 1978). For tributaries of Alpenrhein (Rhine upstream of Lake Constance), ï¬sh passes were planned already in the sixteenth century. Along the Ill River, such a technical facility should have re-enabled migration of lake trout, which was interrupted by a dam to withdraw drinking and process water for the commune Feldkirch. This dam replaced an older and lower construction that was destroyed by a ï¬ood in 1566. Some decades later, the manorial lords upstream raised an ofï¬cial complaint because their main ï¬shing target was missed. A ï¬sh bypass was suggested as possible solution but never built due to the technical problems of such a construction in the schistose rocks (ZÃ¶smair 1886). A ï¬sh pass was however realized on the Albula River, a tributary of Hinterrhein in the Swiss canton GraubÃ¼nden, after millers erected a new dam in the 1680s and interrupted lake trout migration. The passage had a length of 6 m and a width of 1.5 m (Bundi 1988). In the late nineteenth and especially in the twentieth century, the number of dams rose exponentially around the globe, ï¬rst in the North and then in the South (see Chaps. 1 and 6). They continued to serve century-long functions especially as hydropower producers and for irrigation. New technologies and machinery built with ever-cheaper steel and powered by fossil energy helped to create concrete ediï¬ces of 100 m height and more. Together with the necessary means to transform mechanic energy into electricity and to transmit this electricity over large distances, large manufacturers and railways and urban administration soon started to beneï¬t. After World War II, electricity use rose, not least with domestic demand for household appliances. In arid regions, dams and reservoirs secured irrigation of agricultural land. A summary on dam construction in the twentieth century demonstrates the increasing pace of large dam building after 1950 (Rosenberg et al. 2000). By 1900, several hundreds of large dams (i.e., equal or higher than 15 m; International Commission on Large Dams) existed. Up until 1950, the total global number newly built per decade was less than 1000. During the 1950s, almost 3000 new dam projects were implemented. In the 1970s, the number peaked at more than new 5400 facilities. In the 1990s, still almost 2000 new constructions occurred globally. In the 2000s and 2010s, the number further decreased, but, e.g., Zarï¬ et al. (2015) assume"
255,181,0.297,Railway Ecology,"Conclusions There have been several studies that quantiï¬ed the level of various disturbances and their impacts on wildlife populations. Plants are, in general, the ï¬rst to be described in relation to air and soil contamination, perhaps due to the facility of realizing experimental analysis, or of using plants as bio-indicators. Nevertheless, there is still little scant knowledge about the mechanisms and processes underlying the behaviour of vertebrates, because most studies concerned only a small number of species (van der Grift 1999). There is strong evidence that noise, light, and vibrations that can reach from 85.5 to 97 dB(A), can affect insects, amphibians and birds (Fig. 6.2). In contrast, the availability of food and vegetation in the railway verges seems to overcome the noise pollution and seems to attract reptiles, some bird species, and several mammals (Fig. 6.2). There is a wide diversity of measures to minimize railway disturbances, but further studies are needed to understand the effectiveness of these measures in reducing railway disturbance of wildlife.

All of these factors may exacerbate the impact of rising sea level in the area. Along the northwest portion of the Big Bend coast, between the Fenholloway River and the Aucilla River, is an area illustrating changes most common to the Big Bend marshes and coastal forests. Figure 6.41 shows relatively small losses along the marine marsh boundaries but rather significant inland recession of the coastal forest boundary as tidal marshes expand inland. According to Raabe et al. (2004), increased tidal flooding has resulted in loss of hammocks in tidal marsh and widespread inland recession of the upland forest boundary. Although marsh shoreline recession is most common along the coast, small areas of shoreline advance are present, primarily the result of high marsh bank slumping and recolonization by low marsh species (Raabe et al. 2004). Overall, Big Bend shoreline change documents relatively minor movement in both directions with significant growth of intertidal marsh over adjacent uplands in response to sea-level rise over an approximate 100-year period. As documented by Raabe et al. (2004), dieback of coastal forests is common in the low-gradient Big Bend area as marine water submerges the limestone surface under rising seas. 6.3.4.2.3 Northeastern Gulf Barrier Islands and Beaches The barrier island-inlet system of the northeastern GoM extends from the western margin of Ochlockonee Bay, FL (eastern margin of the Apalachicola River Delta) west to Cat Island,"

Moreover, about 39 taxa of aquatic invertebrates were reported following a 2-year study of pesticide application on Malaysian rice fields (Lim 1980). Across 18 sites in the Philippines and India the highest number of aquatic invertebrate taxa reported was 26 and the lowest was 2 by single sampling at individual sites (Roger et al. 1987). Based on these data recorded from 1975 to the present, they stated that crop intensification had a tendency to decrease the values for total number of species; however, it cannot be accepted as a general concept that crop intensification decreases biodiversity in rice fields (Simpson et al. 1994)."

Thirteen taxa are included in this group, with the most larvae being scaled sardines (Harengula jaguana), round herring (Etrumeus teres), and Spanish sardine (Sardinella aurita) in the spring and Atlantic thread herring (Opisthonema oglinum), Spanish sardine, and scaled sardines in the fall (Table 7.2). While scaled sardines and Atlantic thread herring were distributed throughout the continental shelf during the fall, they were sparsely distributed throughout the open Gulf and Florida Shelf in the spring (Figures 7.18 and 7.19). The Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) is one of the most abundant pelagic fishes in the northern coastal Gulf of Mexico; it is an exploited marine resource, the principal prey for many important commercial and recreational fish species, as well as marine birds and mammals. As both a planktivore and detritivore, Gulf menhaden are an integral and key component of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem (Vaughan et al. 2011). However, because adults spawn primarily near the mouth of the Mississippi River during the winter and the plankton surveys were conducted in the spring and fall, only one Gulf menhaden juvenile was collected in the plankton surveys (Table 7.2). From 1982 through 2007, average clupeid larval abundances were highly variable from year to year during the spring and fall for both gear types (Figures 7.20 and 7.21). For neuston net samples, the average abundance of Clupeidae larvae ranged from 0 (2004) to 68.5 (1983) larvae per 10-min tow in the spring in the open Gulf and from 1.3 (1983) to 97.4 (1993) larvae per 10-min tow during the fall along the continental shelf (Figures 7.20 and 7.21). Average clupeid larval abundance for bongo net samples ranged from 11.7 (1982) to 247.2 (1999) larvae per 10 m2 and from 6.7 (1983) to 225.9 (1995) larvae per 10 m2 during spring and fall plankton surveys, respectively (Figures 7.20 and 7.21). For both gear types, the average abundance of Clupeidae larvae was typically higher along the continental shelf during the fall, compared to spring in the open Gulf of Mexico. Family Coryphaenidae"
255,246,0.297,Railway Ecology,"using a GPS unit (Trimble Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, USA). Black and grizzly bear scats were classiï¬ed as âbearâ because they could not be differentiated in the ï¬eld. When the diameter, age and contents were visibly similar for scats found within 5 m, only one scat was recorded. All scats detected were removed from the CPR to avoid double counting. Where multiple tracks were encountered, e.g., sidings, all tracks were surveyed and the mean number of scats detected per track was used in the analysis. Perpendicular transects were used to estimate relative abundance for bears and ungulates within the railroad corridor (<250 m). Two random points were generated within each rail segment in a GIS for each sampling year. Each point was used as the starting location for a perpendicular transect. At each point, a transect extended out perpendicularly away from the CPR in both directions for 250 m; the transects were 3 m wide. Pellet groups and scat found more than 1.5 m from the transect center were not recorded. Perpendicular transects were truncated at the edge of impassable features such as rock cliffs, rivers and open water. Along each transect ungulate pellet groups were classiï¬ed into those of elk or deer based on differences in size and shaped as described by Elbroch (2003). White-tailed deer and mule deer pellets were combined into one class of âdeerâ because they could not be reliably differentiated in the ï¬eld. The number of pellet groups was counted for each transect. Bear scats were recorded using the same criteria as the rail bed transects. Pellets and scat that appeared to be more than a year old-based on visible signs of decay (bleached color or unconsolidated) were excluded as were amorphous ungulate or bear feces (Elbroch 2003). The count of bear scats were weighted based on the date they were detected, as they are detectable throughout the short summer season (Dorsey 2011). The ï¬rst day that bears have been historically sighted in the study area is April 15; although the date of bearsâ emergence varies each year, it was used as a starting date for when bears could have been foraging on grain and left scats. As each day passed after April 15, there were cumulatively more days when bears could have visited and left scats. Therefore, each scat was given a weight inversely proportional to the day of year it was detected after April 15, which is the 105th Julian calendar day of the year. For example, the weighted value of one scat detected on September 13th, (day 273 of the year) would be ((273â105)â1 = 0.006). The ï¬nal value was the sum of all weighted scats detected for each track segment stored as RArail bed. The relative abundance for each species was deï¬ned as the number of pellet groups or weighted value kmâ1 within each 4.86 km long segment (i) (Eq. 1). For example, the relative abundance of elk, RArail corridor (i) was the number of elk pellet groups kmâ1 averaged over n transects (t) within each rail segment (i)."

169,336,0.296,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Hence, conservation and restoration practitioners and researchers need to share information effectively and with diverse audiences such as policy- and decision-makers, NGOs, and other stakeholders to ensure sharing most recent ï¬ndings and to enable proactive management (Seavy et al. 2009). Rapid environmental change urgently requires society to be informed about the ongoing and upcoming threats related to climate change. Broad suggestions for adapting rivers to climate change impacts are similar to those for other ecosystems, including the enhancement of resilience, connectivity, and legal protection while reducing stressors, such as habitat degradation or fragmentation (Palmer et al. 2008). However, the development of adequate and robust management strategies is key to conserve intact, freshwater habitats. With respect to climate change and aquatic ecosystems, water temperature is one of the master variables that requires attention. Riparian vegetation contributes various important functions in relation to aquatic habitats, including the moderation of water and ambient air temperature via evapotranspiration and reduction of solar energy input by shading. It thus provides a buffer zone that ï¬lters sediments and nutrients, provides food, and creates woody debris as habitat for xylobiont species (Richardson et al. 2007). Evapotranspiration rates are highest in forest habitats due to their high leaf area index (Tabacchi et al. 1998). In this context, a major issue is the mitigation potential of riparian vegetation to keep rivers cooler. Recent studies have shown that shading by riparian vegetation can buffer the warming effects of climate change (Bond et al. 2015). Another important aspect in climate change adaptation is habitat connectivity. As discussed above, species will tend to follow their preferred thermal niche in their river network. Accordingly, the spatial connection between different river reaches is highly important, especially for cold-water taxa, as long-term thermal refugia are located upstream where water temperature is lowest along the longitudinal continuum. As shown by Isaak et al. (2015), thermal habitats in mountain streams seem highly resistant to temperature increases. As a result, many populations of coldwater species currently exist where they are well-buffered from climate change. However, connectivity is not only relevant on the scale of the river network. On shorter time scales, cold-water refugia may occur as patchy distributions along the river course. Deep pools with high groundwater exchange rates or other river sections with groundwater intrusion can provide valuable habitats where species can endure heat waves. Accordingly such refugia must be connected to the surrounding habitats such that they can be accessed and used. However, morphological degradation impedes the availability of such refugia. Thus, habitat heterogeneity and morphological integrity, including natural riverbed and sediment dynamics, are essential to provide adequate habitat patches for different species and their life stages, also from the thermal point of view. In addition to climate change, the future of freshwater ecosystems will be strongly inï¬uenced by other sources of stress: socioeconomic and technological changes as well as demographic developments on the global scale (Dudgeon et al. 2006; Nelson et al. 2006). Ultimately, as climate change impacts start to overwhelm the capacity of society and of ecosystems to cope or adapt, substantial reduction in GHG emissions"

This âlitter artifactâ in the middle of the ocean was popularly called the âGreat Pacific Garbage Patch,â which had a significant impact on the public perception of the problem. The linguistic framing of the plastic pollution repelled the public by playing on the yuck factor, similar to the case of GMOs described above. The pollution was also unknown to many, making the novelty of the problem significant (driver 7). On the other hand, this description did give some backlash since it created an illusion of islands of plastics floating around in the ocean. Since such islands do not exist in reality, some commentators have argued that the environmental problem was exaggerated and that this could erode citizensâ trust in institutions [24]. Plastic pollution was not perceived as such a big risk in the decades after the first reports were published. This can be explained using several of the risk perception drivers (Table 1). Since plastic pollution was first reported as a phenomenon on the open ocean and not related directly to severe impacts on marine species and ecosystems, it was not perceived as a risk with âpotential for disasterâ (driver 4) nor a contamination that impacted a large group of people (driver 5). Debris in the middle of the ocean has no direct link to any human populations per se, which might also have affected the lack of public response (driver 5). Furthermore, oceanic pollution is abstract and not so tangible since it is not easily visible to most people. Therefore, the âGiddens paradoxâ (driver 8) might also have influenced the lack of perceived risk in these early years. Finally, there was very little information communicated to the public about the problem, for instance, from 2004 to 2010, microplastics were only mentioned a few times in UK newspapers, whereas the number of articles grew markedly in the following years [25]. Since people obviously cannot perceive a risk that they are not aware of, this lack of communication is a final but very important reason for the lack of early alertness to the problem."

In July of 2016, the American Chemistry Council published âPlastics and Sustainability: A valuation of environmental benefits, costs and opportunities for continuous improvement,â largely a comparison of life cycle analyses putting plastic in a positive light against alternative materials (glass, metal, paper). At the same time, the Plastic Pollution Policy Project convened 18 organizations focused on zero waste initiatives to align on policy and campaigns and to create common messaging to counter industry-dominated narratives. A movement has emerged, while stakeholder positions have dug in their heels. Here we have discussed solutions to microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, which largely form in terrestrial environments from primary or secondary microplastics. We know that microplastics are global, increasingly toxic over time, and impacts to wildlife are pervasive, leading to the collective conclusion that plastic in the environment causes harm. We also know that capturing microplastic downstream is extremely difficult and requires upstream intervention."
389,354,0.296,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"in both the internal organs and muscle of ayu (internal organs: t = â3.855, p < 0.001; muscle: t = â2.809, p = 0.006) (Fig. 17.6). The concentrations in the internal organs of ayu were positively correlated with those in the riverbed samples (i.e., fish prey) that were collected simultaneously with the ayu (t = 8.197, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no correlation between the concentrations in the ayu muscle and the riverbed samples (t = â1.202, p = 0.261; Fig. 17.6). Thus, we conclude that herbivorous fish assimilate radiocesium from the microalgae and silt on the riverbed stones as they forage. Between 2011 and 2013, the activity concentration of radiocesium in the internal organs and the muscle of ayu declined, mainly because of the half-life of 134Cs (2.07 years), which is considerably shorter than the 30.1 years for 137Cs. However, the concentration of 137Cs in the whole ayu body tended to decrease during 2011 (Iguchi et al. 2013). Therefore, the decrease in the concentration of 137Cs in ayu cannot be explained only by the half-life of 134Cs. The activity concentration of 137Cs in the internal organs, which represented the majority of the 137Cs in ayu, was correlated with that in the riverbed samples. Therefore, the decrease of 137Cs in the riverbed, which may have been caused by flushing out of the contaminated soil from the mountains, would explain the decrease of 137Cs in ayu. In European lakes, Cs concentrations in fish muscle peaked a few years after the Chernobyl disaster (Jonsson et al. 1999; Smith et al. 2000). Then, the rate of decrease in muscle 137Cs concentrations was initially rapid, but later slowed. Conversely, in the rivers of Fukushima, the radiocesium contamination levels in ayu peaked immediately after the FNPP accident. The concentrations then decreased slowly, fluctuating with the transport of fresh polluted sediment from the mountains following snowmelt and typhoon events (Figs. 17.5 and 17.6). Ayu fork length was correlated not with concentrations of radiocesium in the internal organs but with that in the muscle (internal organs: t = â1.168, p = 0.246; muscle: t = 4.329, p < 0.001). The concentration of 137Cs in fish increases with fish size according to a power law relationship because of changes in prey items (Smith et al. 2002). For instance, the concentration in northern pike (Esox lucius) increased as the trophic level of prey increased from plankton to invertebrates and then to small fish. Indeed, the level of radiocesium contamination in fish at Fukushima increased according to the order herbivores (i.e., ayu) < omnivores < piscivores at Fukushima (Mizuno and Kubo 2013). A positive correlation was also observed for ayu body size relative to the muscle concentration of radiocesium. Thus, in this case, the positive correlation between ayu body size and radiocesium concentrations in their muscle could not be explained by a change in feeding patterns because the prey size and the prey items do not change as the ayu grows. Also, the time (season) of collection had no effect on the activity concentrations of radiocesium in ayu muscle. The activity concentration of radiocesium in fish is a function of uptake and elimination rates. In hatchery-reared ayu, assimilation efficiency decreases as the fish grow (Akutsu et al. 2001). Larger ayu therefore need much more food per unit weight gain than smaller individuals. Thus, at our study site, larger ayu have greater potential to accumulate radiocesium from microalgae on the riverbed stones than smaller ayu."

302,296,0.296,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"In principle, aquatic species interact with MPs through a variety of pathways featuring direct or indirect ingestion, respiration, or attachment to the body surface. Therefore, a single stressor (e.g., inert particle) influences life-cycle parameters on multiple levels. For instance, the presence of MPs can limit the nutrient assimilation by reducing the proportion of available food particles or by interfering with feeding mechanisms and locomotion, influencing digestion efficiency, and driving behavioral adaptations (e.g., avoidance, foraging). This implies that effect studies with MPs should focus on multiple endpoints including typical life-cycle parameters (e.g., reproduction, growth, nutritional state), histological analyses, and biomarker responses. Furthermore, the implementation of time-course, chronic, and multigenerational test designs might help uncover adaptive responses as well as cascading effects in populations. Only the simultaneous investigation and direct comparison of the toxicity of natural and polymeric particles will enable discovering specific MP-associated risks in the diversity of particulate matter. In the absence of this reference, adverse effects of MPs observed in the laboratory could be nothing but a representation of the (normal) biological response and physiological condition induced by natural particles. However, species in freshwater systems are adapted to naturally occurring particles, and it remains relatively unclear whether polymer particles act differently or have the potential to bypass protective adaptations."
231,801,0.295,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Climate is one of the factors regulating recruitment of ï¬sh in the North Sea. It has been shown to influence many species, including cod, sole, plaice and herring. Temperature generally has a positive effect on recruitment of cod stocks at the cold end of their latitudinal range and a negative effect on warm-water stocks, including the North Sea stock (Planque and Fredou 1999). The relation has been shown using different statistical stock-recruitment models (Olsen et al. 2011; Ottersen et al. 2013) and is thought to be responsible for the series of high recruitment during the cold period of the 1960s and early 1970s (OâBrien et al. 2000; Brander and Mohn 2004), contributing also to the âgadoid outburstâ of the late 1960s to mid-1980s, when productivity of cod and other demersal stocks was extraordinarily high (Cushing 1984; Rijnsdorp et al. 2010). Cod recruitment has been low during recent warm years and the stock biomass may remain low unless cooler conditions return (Olsen et al. 2011). Direct physiological effects of temperature on cod (particularly growth) have already been described. The temperature effect on recruitment is mediated through survival during the planktonic and early life stages and is probably due to a combination of direct and indirect effects. Production of a sufï¬cient supply of the right sizes and quality of zooplankton prey, in particular the cool-temperate copepod Calanus ï¬nmarchicus, at the right time of year affects cod survival and recruitment (Beaugrand et al. 2003; Mieszkowska et al. 2009). Climate-related changes in spring SST and copepod abundance have consequences for the spatial patterns of recruitment in the North Sea (Nicolas et al. 2014) and probably for adult distribution as well. Herring in the North Sea have experienced two periods of weak recruitment during recent decades. Poor recruitment during the period 1971â1979 has been ascribed to low"

Most studies to date have been on temperate-zone insectivorous bats. However, many tropical bats feed on nectar and fruits, thereby pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds of several hundred species of plants (Ghanem and Voigt 2012). Consequently, frugivorous bats are key for succession and maintaining plant diversity, especially in fragmented Neotropical landscapes (Medellin and Gaona 1999; Muscarella and Fleming 2007). However, very little is known about the impact of light pollution on this feeding guild. Southern long-nosed bats Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, a nectar- and fruit-eating species, used areas of relatively low light intensity when commuting (Lowery et al. 2009) and Oprea et al. (2009) rarely captured frugivorous bats along roads, although some were present in municipal parks. However, neither study could disentangle the influence of lighting from other factors related to urbanisation, such as altered vegetation cover or increased noise levels. Lewanzik and Voigt (2014) provided the first experimental evidence for light avoidance by frugivorous bats. They found that Sowellâs short-tailed bat Carollia sowelli, a specialist on fruits of the genus Piper, harvested only about half as many fruits in a flight cage compartment lit by a sodium vapour street light than in a dark compartment, and free-ranging bats neglected ripe fruits that were experimentally illuminated (Fig. 7.6). Lewanzik and Voigt (2014) concluded that artificial light might reduce nocturnal dispersal of pioneer plant seeds. Since Fig. 7.6 Artificial lighting reduces and delays feeding behaviour on pepper plants by a frugivorous bat. a Percentage of harvested infructescences of Piper sancti-felices among 14 marked plants harvested by Sowellâs short-tailed bats Carollia sowelli in nonilluminated conditions (black) and under conditions where plants were illuminated by a street lamp (grey) in the field, b time after sunset when infructescences were harvested.

Finally, the ecological sensitivity of different areas and âmarine crossroadsâ where incidents are more likely to occur can be comparably easily identified and located. It is, however, more complex to relate these parameters to what we know about the likelihood of human errors. Although clear distinctions between human error on the one hand and technical malfunction on the other can seldom be made, available statistics show that the former tend to still be the most common cause of incidents and accidents (Knudsen and Hassler 2011)."

For example, in Brazil, Leishmania braziliensis occur in some synanthropic bat species that serve as a reservoir host for leishmaniasis but require sand flies as a vector (Shapiro et al. 2013). Fungus Environments soiled with large accumulations of guano may harbor Histoplasma capsulatum, a fungal pathogen that causes histoplasmosis. When roosts in attics, roofs, and other rooms are not cleaned on a regular basis, guano accumulates creating a greater risk to humans (Bartlett et al. 1982; Martins et al. 2000). Humans can develop histoplasmosis after inhaling the microscopic spores of H. capsulatum, often while participating in activities that disturb a heavily contaminated environment. While histoplasmosis is rarely fatal, infections in individuals with weakened immune systems can become severe (Martins et al. 2000), yet it is questionable that infections by H. capsulatum can be traced back to bats."

Without going into the details of which species or species-areas are included in each of these time frames, it is important to note that the EU discards affect the demersal species more than the pelagic species,66 which is why the implementation did not start with them. So far, the Commission has adopted 5Ã¾3 plans. In October 2014, the Commission adopted five discard plans, applicable from 1 January 2015, for certain pelagic and industrial fisheries.67 One year later, in October 2015, the Commission adopted three discard plans, applicable from 1 January 2016, for certain demersal fisheries.68 The discard ban is established as a landing obligation. Catches during fishing activities in Union waters or by Union fishing vessels in international waters (waters not subject to EU or third countriesâ sovereignty or jurisdiction) must be brought and retained on board the fishing vessels, recorded, landed, and counted against any applicable quotas, except when used as live bait. There are two possible exceptions to this obligation. First, the regulation allows for fishing operators to continue to discard species that, according to the best available scientific advice, have a high survival rate when released into the sea.69 For instance, an exemption from the landing obligation exists for Norway lobster caught in pots, traps, or creels in ICES division VIa and subarea VII.70 Second, to cater for unwanted catches that are unavoidable even when all measures for their reduction are taken, certain de minimis exemptions from the landing obligation may be established.71 For"

For example, the standards of a water body whose designated use involves human contact recreation should protect humans from exposure to microbial pathogens while swimming, wading, or boating. Other uses might require standards to protect humans and aquatic life including ï¬sh, shellï¬sh, and other wildlife from consuming harmful substances. Standards set upstream may impact the uses of water downstream. For example, the water quality of small headwater streams may affect the ability of a downstream area to achieve a particular designated use such as being âï¬shableâ or âswimmable.â In this case, the designated use for the smaller upstream water body may be deï¬ned in terms of the achievement of the designated use of the larger downstream water body.

230,392,0.294,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract Microplastics are an emerging marine pollutant. It is important to understand their distribution in the marine environment and their implications on marine habitats and marine biota. Microplastics have been found in almost every marine habitat around the world, with plastic composition and environmental conditions significantly affecting their distribution. Marine biota interact with microplastics including birds, fish, turtles, mammals and invertebrates. The biological repercussions depend on to the size of microplastics encountered, with smaller sizes having greater effects on organisms at the cellular level. In the micrometre range plastics are readily ingested and egested, whereas nanometre-sized plastics can pass through cell membranes. Despite concerns raised by ingestion, the effects of microplastic ingestion in natural populations and the implications for food webs are not understood. Without knowledge of retention and egestion rates of field populations, it is difficult to deduce ecological consequences. There is evidence to suggest that microplastics enter food chains and there is trophic transfer between predators and prey. What is clear is that further research on a variety of marine organisms is required to understand the environmental implications of microplastics in more detail and to establish effects in natural populations.

One of objectives was to advance and further deï¬ne the permitting process in Federal waters, and another was engage and train displaced ï¬shermen in a new venture. In this case, 2 sites were chosen but one was abandoned due to conflicts identiï¬ed early with the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary nearby and its management plan that does not permit aquaculture within its boundaries.

233,538,0.294,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Metapopulation Capacity Gathering distribution estimates is difï¬cult for rare or elusive species, and gathering population data more so, often because of the inaccessibility of their habitat which in turn biases ecological studies around the world (Martin et al. 2012). Population viability analysis can predict species trends, but such modelling also requires a certain level of life history data (Brook et al. 2000) that is unavailable for the full spectrum of species of concern. We have quality landscape data, but we want to know how this affects the species that reside in such landscapes. Once such tactic is looking at metapopulation capacity (Î»M), calculated from spatial input (i.e. patch areas and distances) of spatially explicit metapopulation models. We can consider metapopulation theory as a compromise between landscape ecology and species distribution modelling (Hanski 1998). The resulting value is the capacity of a landscape to support long-term species persistence (Hanski and Ovaskainen 2000). Î»M is one way of assessing risk for species living in fragmented landscapes, as a relative quantiï¬cation of fragmentation. Schnell and coworkers (2013a) further developed a modiï¬cation of Î»M for large-scale landscapes. Speciesâ habitats fragment over time, often due to human land use changes, and eventually the animals grow increasingly endangered. When isolated populations are too small and isolated, the metapopulation as a whole goes extinct. Therefore, Î»M can be useful in prioritising species conservation from a spatial standpoint (Hanski and Simberloff 1997; Hanski and Ovaskainen 2002; Schnell et al. 2013b). In the realm of conserving evolutionary history we can argue in much the same way, so combining the Î»M and ED could help us to prioritise and plan conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner, by factoring in the underlying processes of fragmentation, while balancing the objective of conserving evolutionary history. We can even calculate Î»M at the patch level, allowing us to target speciï¬c areas within a species distribution for conservation prioritization (Ovaskainen and Hanski 2003).

Irrespective of the boat lifetimes, the total demand for the entire market (except Santorini) increases steadily and tops of at 40 large boats for the base run. For both LT204 and LT276 however, the number of large boats increases to around 50 as the boatyardâs capacity is more evenly distributed over the years, leading to more purchases of large boats as more capacity is available because boat orders are less clustered."

They have provided people water-based recreational opportunities and have been a source of water for wildlife and their habitats. They have also served as a means of transporting and transforming waste products that are discharged into them. The quantity and quality regimes of streams and rivers have been a major factor in governing the type, health, and biodiversity of riparian and aquatic ecosystems. Floodplains have provided fertile lands for agricultural crop production and relatively flat lands for the siting of roads and railways and commercial and industrial complexes. In addition to the economic beneï¬ts that can be derived from rivers and their floodplains, the aesthetic beauty of most natural rivers has made lands adjacent to them attractive sites for residential and recreational development. Rivers and their floodplains have generated, and, if managed properly, can continue to generate, substantial cultural, economic, environmental, and social beneï¬ts for their inhabitants. Human activities undertaken to increase the beneï¬ts obtained from rivers and their floodplains may also increase the potential for costs and damages such as when the river is experiencing periods of droughts, floods, and heavy pollution.

55,128,0.293,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"and said very little about exogenous or endogenous candidiasis, at a time when nystatin was attracting attention. At the 1950 NYAS meeting, Samuel B. Salvin, then at the Division of Infectious Diseases at NIH, placed the incidence of fungal diseases in context of other infectious diseases. Fungus infections in man, although less frequent than bacterial, are still numerically important. For example, of the 92,933 deaths due to infections and parasitic diseases in the United States in 1945, 284, or 0.3 per cent, were due to mycoses. This was approximately equal to the number of deaths reported as caused by scarlet fever, measles, or the typhus-like diseases (due to rickettsia), and was more than the total of all deaths recorded from rabies, smallpox, relapsing fever, leprosy, brucellosis, paratyphoid fever, plague, cholera, and anthrax. It should be realized, of course, that effective control measures are employed against some of the aforementioned diseases, whereas control methods against the mycoses not only are not practiced, but, generally, are not even known. It should also be borne in mind that the dermatophytoses, although characteristically nonfatal, are extremely common, probably equalling the most widespread of the bacterial or virus diseases in prevalence.6 In 1953, Walter Nickerson from the Department of Microbiology, Rutgers University, tried a creative presentation of mortality data to chart the rise of fungal infections.7 He used graphs for the period 1945â1949 that showed starkly opposite mortality trends, where âall infectionsâ had dropped sharply, while that from mycoses had increased markedly. Nickerson had produced his graphic illustration by using very different scales for the two classes of infection. Deaths from mycoses were recorded as actual numbers, while those from all infections were recorded in thousands. The alarming increase of nearly 50% in fungal infection deaths was actually from 270 to 380, while the actual number of deaths from all infections had fallen 30%, from 93,000 to 66,000 deaths â still 170 times greater! In the event, the annual total deaths from mycoses in the next decade never reached 500.8 More telling was Nickersonâs point about morbidity; he stated that âmycotic infections are probably the mostly widely distributed and most numerous types of infection, with dermatophyte infections, such as athleteâs foot, alone as prevalent as the most widespread of the bacterial and virus diseasesâ.9 Medical mycologists had long argued for recognition of the distinctive pathogenicity of fungi.

241,1114,0.293,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"19.2.2 Zooplankton It is well known that oceanic zooplankton respond to variations in climate (e.g. Beaugrand and Reid 2003; Hays et al. 2005). The response has usually been explained as a bottomup process: the atmospheric forcing influences primary productivity through hydrography and stratiï¬cation of water, which changes mixing depth, light and availability of nutrients. This in turn affects grazing zooplankton, planktivorous ï¬sh and even seabirds (Aebischer et al. 1990; Frederiksen et al. 2006). Similar responses to climate or weather parameters have also been shown in the Baltic Sea. For instance in the Gulf of Finland, there was a signiï¬cant positive correlation between westerly winds and the abundance of marine copepods, whereas easterly winds promoted a high abundance of small euryhaline cladocerans (Viitasalo et al. 1995). This could have been caused by westerly winds advecting saline waterâ and marine speciesâfrom the northern Baltic Proper into the Gulf of Finland, and it remained unclear whether any trophic effects were involved. In contrast, rotifers and cladocerans were positively associated with high sea surface temperatures in summer (Viitasalo et al. 1995). In this case, the warm water probably increased growth rates of these surface-dwelling taxa and also increased the availability of suitable small-sized food in the strongly stratiï¬ed water (Kivi et al. 1993). In an analysis of open-sea monitoring data for the Gulf of Finland and northern Baltic Proper in 1979â2008, rotifers also increased at the expense of crustacean zooplankton, apparently due to the combined effects of changes in hydrography, eutrophication and top-down pressure (Suikkanen et al. 2013). This resulted in a shift towards a food web structure with smaller sized organisms."

Radiocesium concentration was measured as described by Shigenobu et al. (2014). Fat greenlings caught from the northern waters had a relatively lower radiocesium concentration than those collected from the southern waters (Table. 12.1). In the southern waters, the level of contamination was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in coastal waters, at depth less than 30 m (geometric mean, 128 Bq/kg-wet) than in offshore waters, at depth greater than 50 m (geometric mean, 28.4 Bq/kg-wet). The highest radiocesium concentration detected was 1,070 Bq/kg-wet in a fat greenling collected from the southern coastal waters on 20 May 2012. In this study, none of the fish specimens had a radiocesium concentration higher than 10,000 Bq/kg-wet weight.

See Sections 8.6 and 8.7 below for related environmental and habitat issues that govern oyster populations and the oyster fishery.

36,829,0.293,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Generally, it is a lot easier to attract funding for specific projects and programs than for staff or volunteer compensation, but these projects may be short term and tied to specific areas. Conservation solutions that require long-term monitoring with standardized methodologies (mandatory for statistical inference of success or failure of interventions) often lack âinnovation appealâ to referees and funding organizations. Access to core or unrestricted funding which can be used for key strategic work, or to maintain basic network administration, is hard to secure. BCT has managed to grow its unrestricted income through donations, membership, legacies, and community fundraising, with some success, but this takes time and investment, and can be hard to maintain during periods of economic downturn. Ironically, while lack of protective legislation hampers conservation progress for some networks, protective legislation can lead to negative attitudes toward bats in other areas, particularly during recessions when protection of species can be seen as a barrier to economic growth. In addition, perceived âexaggeratedâ bat protection efforts can lead to reluctance among citizens to admit to the occurrence of bats in their property at all, for fear of losing partial control over their property. In a social network, links between actors are almost entirely based on forms of communication, so mechanisms for communication (from face-to-face to online contact) are critical for the success of a network, particularly when members are geographically dispersed. All the bat conservation networks have a Web presence for interaction and/or issue newsletters, and many have regular face-to-face meetings, but gaps in communication can cause network stress, particular when node diversity is high (i.e., members come from many different backgrounds and perspectives). Effective communication is critical if network members differ in their position on a key issue. For example, tensions between the core actors in BCT and supporters and volunteers in 2006 over BCTâs stance on a government study of rabies in bats generated very strong concerns (Racey et al. 2013). This led to a review and new model of working with volunteers (partner and network agreements, regular meetings and communication) which proved very beneficial."

(2002) found a negative effect on the density of birds on railways in general, they did not ï¬nd differences in bird density between quiet and busy railways. Indeed, there is evidence that bird species tolerate the railway disturbance due to the attractiveness of numerous railway-related features. Species whose predators show negative responses to train disturbance may also beneï¬t from the railway vicinity (Rytwinski and Fahrig 2012). Railway verges may create edge effects that can increase biodiversity. In fact, special microclimatesâ thanks to different temperatures or insolation and new habitat availability along the edgesâcan enhance habitat heterogeneity in homogeneous landscapes (Delgado et al. 2007). In turn, these new habitats may improve resting and foraging opportunities for some bird species (Morelli et al. 2014). Also, railways can be a useful source for gastrolithsâ digestive purposes, and a source of sand bathing locations used by birds to clean the feathers. Ghosh et al. (2010) showed that apparently due to the food availability, house sparrows (Passer domesticus) adapted to loud noise (between 35 and 95 dB), being undisturbed by passing trains at the railway station study site. Equally, Li et al. (2010) observed the abundance and richness of seven ground-dwelling bird species, namely the Tibetan ground tit (Pseudopodoces humilis), Tibetan lark (Melanocorypha maxima), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), white-winged snowï¬nch (Montifringillla nivalis), plain-backed snowï¬nch (M. blandfordi), white-rumped snowï¬nch (M. taczanowskii), and rufous-necked snowï¬nch (M. ruï¬collis). They found greater numbers of individuals of these species near the Qinghai-Tibet railway (less than 300 m) than farther away (from 300 to 1,200 m), probably due to verges provide nesting sites and foraging opportunities. The non-continuous nature of the noise near railways due to the intermittent flow of train trafï¬c may constitute the main reason that some birds ignore the railway. This was hypothesized by Wiacek et al. (2015) to explain the greater abundance of the breeding community of woodland birds near a busy railway line in Poland when they assessed the effect of noise at three different distances from the track (30, 280, and 530 m). Species with low frequency calls, such as the wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) and common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), also occurred in large numbers near railways. Other bird species also seem to ignore the railway disturbance. For example, more than 90% of bald eagle nests were built near human infrastructures, including railways that had more than 1,000 railcars going by each day (Mundahl et al. 2013)."

The Habitats Directive already reflects several of the adaptation law principles, without making any of them explicitly considerate of aspects of climate change adaptation. For example, surveillance is within the scope of Art. 9â11 HD, entailed by the duties to report and research in Art. 17 and 18 HD. The situation is similar regarding the WFD. Whilst the monitoring programmes stipulated in Art. 8 WFD are generally not designed to cater for the need to identify and monitor climatic aspects, they will inherently contribute to the detection and understanding of aspects of climate change (EC 2009, p. 50). The Birds Directive contains no monitoring duties, but it does stipulate research and reporting obligations (Art. 10 and 12 BD). Most significantly, on the level of an individual protected area, management planning according to Art. 6 (1) HD induces the scope of monitoring needed in order to identify the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types that are protected in the area and under the prevalent conditions (Schumacher and Schumacher 2012, p. 120). The general deterioration prohibition, Art. 6 (2) HD, and the assessment of implications of plans and projects stipulated in Art. 6 (3), (4) HD serve the purpose of at least maintaining resilience, although improvement cannot be directly achieved with these instruments. With regard to climate change impacts, this"

Accumulated values for the period from March 21, 2011 to July 31, 2012, when the fat greenling was thought to be affected by contamination off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, were as high as 5.4 Ã 106 Bq/l at site-FP, 2.2 Ã 105 Bq/l at site-F1, and 1.8 Ã 104 Bq/l at site-F2. These accumulated values were indicative of the direct load of radioactivity in the ecosystem at each site. In addition, accumulation curves of 137Cs concentrations of each sites indicated sharp increase during the early days and reached 90 % of accumulated values of July 31, 2012 in first 20 (site-FP), 21 (site-F1), and 45 (site-F2) days. Cs concentration data for fat greenlings in the coastal waters of Fukushima Prefecture were extracted from the dataset published by MHLW (2014) and from TEPCO data reports for the 20-km area and the FNPP port (TEPCO 2014a). Timeseries for fat greenlings in the coastal waters of Fukushima and for the 20-km area indicate similar decreasing trends beginning in the spring of 2012 (Fig. 13.3). The median and the 95th percentile values were calculated from the combined data set of both for each 6-month period beginning March 1, 2011. Ecological half-lives calculated from these values for the period from March 2012 to August 2014 were 175 days for 95th percentile and 194 days for median. The values were slightly lower than the results for fat greenlings (217 days) collected from the southern area off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture between August 2011 and September 2012 (Tateda et al. 2013).

(iii) The well-developed Omo riverine forest in Nyangatom territory would be destroyed by the radical drop in the riverâs flow volume and the effective elimination of the annual floodâin turn destroying the key subsidiary activities of wild food gathering, hunting and beekeeping. Nyangatom communities along the Omo would face widespread hunger and desperationâconditions exponentially worsened by the GOKâs expropriation of their lands and clearing of their forest for new commercial scale irrigated agricultural farms. Unable to be mitigated by long-standing exchange relations between Omo riverine zone dwelling Nyangatom with their counterparts settled around Kibish River (Fig. 7.6) and in the Ilemi Tri-angle. Under such dire conditions, the most likely survival option for the Omo Nyangatom would be to migrate back to the Nyangatom and Toposa settlement area in the Ilemi Triangle. This desperate movement would inevitably intensify the already widespread armed conflict in the region as ethnic groups compete for what resources remain (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Like their Dasanech neighbors downstream, the Nyangatom are already experiencing the dismantling of their survival system due to actions by the Ethiopian government. These actions include eviction of settlements and expropriation of their planting lands in favor of the large commerical irrigation agriculture. Recent reports by the Nyangatom include accounts of major such measures by the GOE."
169,28,0.292,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"History has been acknowledged for 20 years as an important research element for river management that has been applied, for example, to deï¬ne reference conditions and assess the level of degradation. The evolution of river uses and related ecological conditions, especially in recent decades, has been utilized to show the impact of humans on these ecosystems. Integrating a historical perspective into river management can, however, go beyond these targets (see, e.g., Haidvogl et al. 2014, 2015; Higgs et al. 2014). Just as present river management decisions will inï¬uence future conditions, paths trodden by users in the past have a bearing on todayâs ecology. Sound long-term studies of the natural and societal drivers shaping historical river changes can thus support our understanding of the present situation and identify trajectories of change. In long-term studies taking into account the dynamics of natural forcesâin particular climate change and subsequent altered hydrologic and temperature conditionsâas well as social dynamics (e.g., decision-making processes, main energy sources and technologies, superordinated practices and values) can reveal distinct overarching patterns of river use and management. This can contribute to developing future strategies and plans with lower ecological impacts. This chapter describes major milestones of human river uses and ecological impacts. With some brief mention of Asian river case studies, it highlights especially examples, which are representative of industrialized countries of Europe and North America. In Europe, larger environmental changes of aquatic ecosystems occurred already in ancient and medieval times. European colonists spread practices and techniques of river uses to other areas of the industrialized world after they reached"

Shifts in dominant species may affect the biogeochemistry and functioning of the pelagic ecosystem in the following summer. As increasing temperature and stratiï¬cation also favour cyanobacteria, rotifers, and small cladocerans, the plankton community is projected to shift towards smaller sized organisms. Mesocosm studies also suggest that climate change may influence the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and zooplankton, potentially increasing the temporal mismatch between these groups in spring. Such changes may have negative consequences on zooplankton production and thus food conditions of planktivorous ï¬sh. A climate-induced decrease in salinity together with poor oxygen conditions in the deep basins would negatively influence the main Baltic Sea piscivore, cod. Several studies have conï¬rmed that this causes cascading effects on clupeids and zooplankton. It is less clear whether the effects cascade from zooplankton to phytoplankton. Reduced duration and spatial extent of sea ice would cause habitat loss for ice-dwelling organisms, affect the icemodulated landâocean interactions, and probably induce changes in nutrient dynamics within and under the sea ice."
231,1028,0.292,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The survival of a species can be directly impaired if temperatures are shifted beyond the fundamental thermal niche, leading to local extinction (Fig. 10.6). Temperature also affects the fundamental niche of a species with respect to other conditions, which are often directly related to temperature (e.g. oxygen saturation, hydrological regimes, solute concentrations). Indirect consequences of temperature change can be seen in freshwaters from around the North Sea, for example with respect to stratiï¬cation regimes (Wagner and Adrian 2011) or oxygenation (Wilhelm and Adrian 2008). These changes alter the environmental ï¬ltering of colonising species, such that local diversity can increase or decrease depending on the number of species that are precluded or enabled to establish viable populations. The meta-community context (Leibold et al. 2004) reflects the interplay of dispersal and local processes and will become an important tool to predict future changes in aquatic biodiversity. This is even more likely given that much of the regional biodiversity in aquatic systems is contributed by ponds and shallow lakes as these have high beta-diversity due to their often isolated nature (Scheffer et al. 2006) and provide important ecosystem services such as carbon storage due to their high number (Giller et al. 2004; Downing et al. 2006; Tranvik et al. 2009). At the same time, there is high potential for small isolated systems to lose species with global climate change (Burgmer and Hillebrand 2011) and spatial dynamics are important for maintaining biodiversity in these systems. Meta-community dynamics can also provide spatial insurance for freshwater ecosystems (Loreau et al. 2003). In a meta-community mesocosm study, colonisation from a regional species pool and higher biodiversity positively affected the recovery of the pond ecosystems from heat stress (Thompson and Shurin 2012). Changes in species turnover with time reflect changes in biodiversity dynamics, i.e. local immigration and extinction."

376,976,0.292,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","the Altiplano is becoming warmer and drier (Seth et al. 2010). This has implications for reducing forage quality (ZorogastÃºa-Cruz et al. 2012) and drying of evergreen peat bogs (bofedales) that are fed by glacial melt and provide key grazing for camelids (i.e., alpaca and, to a lesser extent, llama). There are also instances where increased land pressure occurs when too many families reside in the same area or when remittances are heavily invested in livestock (Turin and Valdivia 2011). Emigration of men or youths seeking urban jobs or secondary schooling has undercut the labor supply for herding and managing natural subirrigation systems. In some instances introduced forages (e.g., alfalfa) have been successfully established in agro-pastoral zones, reducing pressure on native range and allowing expansion of smallholder dairy operations (Turin and Valdivia 2013). For Bolivia, Healy (2001) documents how tractor introductionâin support of expanding quinoa cultivationâhas displaced llama production. The rangelands of northern Mexico are comprised of highly diverse landscapes (Table 17.1). The large, private ranchers focus on beef cattle, and they have access to land mostly situated in the most productive, semiarid grassland region. African forage grasses (i.e., Cenchrus ciliaris, Eragrostis curvula) have been introduced to boost rangeland productivity. A peasant class of pastoralists (ejidatarios) is found in the arid and semiarid hilly desert scrub (ejido) region where cattle, goats, and sheep can be herded in a traditional, seminomadic fashion; animals feed on native forage and crop residues. Ranches utilize cow-calf production systems based on grass forage. Steers are finished at large feedlots in preparation for export to the US. Animals produced in the ejido system are typically sold in local markets. Livestock grazing pressure has been intense in Mexico since the arrival of the Spanish. Large portions of the semiarid zone have been subjected to nonirrigated cultivation, and deforestation has occurred. Multiyear droughts are common. Nearly half of the rangelands have endured severe soil erosion and woody encroachment due to heavy grazing and lack of fire (SEMARNAT 2005). Other trends include unfavorable shifts in land cover and plant species composition, including the expansion of introduced invasive species; this is most apparent in desert scrub ecosystems (SEMARNAT 2005). Climate studies indicate that precipitation patterns have been changing; warmer, drier conditions are expected (PiÃ±eda-MartÃ­nez et al. 2007)."
219,526,0.292,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Agricultural expansion is the main driver of LUCC in La Paz (Wilson 2007). The extent of native forest decreased by 19.3 % in 2011 compared to 1991. This suggests an annual deforestation rate of 1.12 % (Sabattini et al. in press). Given that forests provide a variety of ecosystem services, deforestation is causing signiï¬cant losses that affect both local people and the rest of the world (Zaccagnini et al. 2014). The soybean monoculture has increased the risk of soil erosion and water contamination due to use of herbicides (Wilson 2007). Efforts to prevent and reverse land degradation processes are being made. They include land use planning to develop more diversiï¬ed and integrated land use/cover. A watershed approach is promoted to ensure that the planned land use/cover is supported by the natural capacity of the watershed and is consistent with the socio-cultural characteristics of the resident communities (Wilson and Sabattini 2001). In this regard, a number of institutions are conducting evaluation of LUCC, habitat fragmentation, soil and water quality, soil erosion, and other ecosystem indicators in the basin of Arroyo. The institutions include INTA EEA ParanÃ¡ and FCA UNER with CONICET and SAyDS7 of Argentina. Furthermore, indicators are seeking to determine the impact of the changes on social issues related to education, health, state assistance, housing quality, land tenure, profitability of agricultural enterprises, and household income. Thus, it is possible to have scientiï¬c technical elements useful in assessing and monitoring, to generate early warnings of degradation processes of natural resources, and from this information, implement appropriate planning of land use policies. This initiative is important in demonstrating Argentinaâs resolve to develop a monitoring and evaluation of land degradation and improvement as well as developing land use planning based on an ecosystem approach. This is consistent with the countryâs M&E of land degradation at a country level that follows the LADA case study."

36,606,0.292,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"only 14 % of native fruit species offered to them were actually consumedâsuggesting that R. aegyptiacus only became common in the eastern Mediterranean with the introduction of new cultivated plants (Korine et al. 1998). The second study found that out of three different types of fruit offered, guava was the most preferred, followed by sea almond (Terminalia catappa) and mango, with fully ripe fruits being preferred over semi-ripe fruits. It concluded that this provided some support for farmersâ claims that bats caused damage to their crops (Yapa et al. 1999). The third study tested fruit choice in relation to nutritional requirements. Flying foxes were found to prefer low-calcium, high-sugar fruits such as papayas, but although sugar was the primary basis for fruit selection, pregnant and lactating females required greater amounts of calcium. However, the flying foxes in this study consistently avoided figs, which are excellent sources of calcium (Nelson et al. 2005). In the last study, bats were found to prefer native and commercially unimportant figs (F. polita), rose apple (Syzygium jambos) and mountain apple (S. malaccense) to the cash crops of lychees and persimmon (Andrianaivoarivelo et al. 2012). These important results provide a perspective on the dietary preferences of pteropodids and should be repeated with other species. There is convincing evidence that planting Muntingia calabura, which is very attractive to C. sphinx, can lessen the impact of these bats on commercial fruit. Singaravelan and Marimuthu (2006) showed that C. sphinx visited Muntingia more than any other wild or commercial fruit and recommended that it is planted around fruit orchards. Vergheseâs (1998) study on grapes in India found that less bat damage occurred closer to a mango orchard and suggested that presence of these trees deters the bats from feeding on grapes. However, it may be that the fruit bats simply show a stronger preference for feeding on mangoes (e.g. Ayensu 1974; Mahmood-Ul-Hassan et al. 2010). It would thus be useful to compare the results of Vergheseâs (1998) study with a similar study in the adjacent mango orchard. Law et al. (2002) recommended planting trees which fruit in spring in Australia to relieve the flying fox damage suffered by orchardists at that time of year. Although the effectiveness of these decoy crops is yet untested, there is evidence that P. poliocephalus will cease consumption of commercial fruit if alternative native foods become available (Eby 1990). However, in order to be effective, the selection of plant species must be based on their high productivity and attractiveness to bats as well as producing fruit at the same time as the commercial crop. Local site conditions must also match the specific needs of the plant in order to ensure optimum growth. Most importantly, these food trees should not be planted in the immediate vicinity of orchards but located away from commercial fruit-growing areas in order to attract the bats away from orchards (Law et al. 2002). The authors also suggest that planting Syzygium around commercial fruit trees may reduce the feeding of bats on the latter. As these planting schemes still need to be tested for effectiveness, Law et al. (2002) suggested monitoring results through regular mapping and identifying dietary changes in the bats."
389,278,0.292,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"We sought to determine whether the observed radioactivity in the environment in the summer of 2012 could maintain radiocesium (134Cs + 137Cs) concentrations of 25,800 Bq/kg-wet in the fat greenling. Marine fish obtain radiocesium from the environment via uptake of food and water. 137Cs concentrations in marine fish directly correlate with the concentrations in seawater under stable conditions (Kasamatsu 1999; IAEA 2004), expressed as the concentration factor (CF). Kasamatsu (1999) summarized the CFs of 137Cs for 27 species of marine teleost fish around Japan. The CFs were calculated from data obtained between 1984 and 1996; the average CF value for each fish species ranged from 22 to 122. The IAEArecommended CF value of 100 for marine fish lies within this range (IAEA 2004). We estimated the CF for fat greenling off the coast of Fukushima prefecture from 29 measures obtained in 1982â2010, archived, and published by the NRA (Nuclear Regulation Authority 2014). The average CF was 67 Â± 29, also within the range described by Kasamatsu (1999). The CF value for fat greenling off the coast of Fukushima suggested that the surrounding seawater should contain 137Cs concentrations of 240 Bq/l to maintain a Cs concentration of 16,000 Bq/kg-wet (25,800 Bq/kg-wet for 134Cs + 137Cs) in the fish. In August 2012, the 137Cs concentration of seawater was less than 0.1 Bq/l off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture; the highest values observed in the FNPP port were also less than 100 Bq/l (TEPCO 2014b). TEPCO (2012b) also reported values much lower than 0.1 Bq/l in samples obtained around the Ota River. We also considered the possibility that excretion of 137Cs from the fish was compensated for by ingestion of prey. Assuming a biological half-life of 100 days (World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2011), the daily excretion rate was calculated as 0.0069 dayâ1 and the daily amount of 137Cs excreted from the fat greenling was 110 Bq/kg-wet. Assuming an ingestion rate of 0.03 dayâ1 and assimilation rate of 0.5 (Tateda 1997), the fat greenling would have to consume more than 7,300 Bq/kg-wet 137Cs daily to compensate for excretion. The 137Cs concentrations in the marine biota within the 20-km area were ND to 1,000 Bq/kg-wet (TEPCO 2014a), far below the required level. Thus, the status of environmental 137Cs contamination in the area off the Ota River and in the 20-km area were insufficient to maintain the 16,000 Bq/kg-wet Cs concentration observed in the fat greenling, which were then assumed to be excreting excess radiocesium."

182,158,0.291,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Subsequently, as contributors to the deepening depression in agriculture, their continuing deaths encouraged the state to assume some responsibility for this activity. Throughout, sheep exerted influence over how and where research was practised, and by whom. In the earlier period, the symptoms they suffered, and the geography and seasonality of their diseases, reinforced agricultural sponsorsâ perceptions of them as products of place, and led to their positioning at the hub of research networks populated by experts in their bodies and environments. Their tendency to fall ill at particular times and in particular places shaped the questions that these experts asked of them, and led to their investigation on farms. State-funded researchers in the early twentieth century paid less heed to the farmed environment and conducted narrower, discipline-specific, laboratory-based enquiries that were underpinned by their different perceptions of sheep as hosts and transmitters of infection. However, their non-human subjects forced them to return intermittently to the field. Throughout, the sheepâs variable responses to both disease and scientific investigations generated a host of conflicting claims about their diseases. Their acknowledged importance as research subjects also encouraged ambitious veterinarians to enrol them in a campaign for professional advancement, which drew strength from the lengthy and intimate relationships that vets claimed to have developed with them. In the course of these activities, sheep built relationships between diverse human and non-human actors including: scientific experts and the state; the microbes, parasites and environments implicated in sheep diseases; the human and animal victims of analogous diseases that helped to shed light on sheep; and the multiple species of experimental animals that acted as sheep proxies. Through these relationships, sheep were awarded new roles as patients, pathological specimens, experimental material, culture media, victims and shapers of their environments, subjects of field trials, hosts and transmitters of infection, food for parasites, points of comparison with other species, and commercial products. Made and remade in the course of scientific enquiries, the sheepâs identity was in a constant state of flux. Their lived experiences also changed. As scientific subjects, sheep underwent clinical monitoring and treatment, feeding trials, dipping, experimental inoculations, parasitic infections, and premature, purposeful deaths. This had ramifications for farmed sheep, which were treated by dipping, drenching, dosing, isolation, managed grazing and restricted breeding in efforts to promote their health."
273,63,0.291,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"Driving forces can be classified into different types according to different criteria. According to the path by which various influencing factors take effect on ecological environment, they can be classified into direct driving force and indirect driving force. Direct driving force directly influence the course of ecological environment and is the physical, chemical and biological driving forces for changes in ecological environment and its services; we may identify and measure them by different accuracy. Direct driving forces include climate change, regional land utilization and land coverage change, species introduction or elimination, technological improvement and application, external input (such as fertilizer application, insect pest control, irrigation, etc.), various natural, physical and biological driving forces (such as volcanic mountain), harvest and resource consumption. Indirect driving forces have wider effects, often take effect by changing one or more direct driving forces; they are the different kinds of signals stimulating decision making process and thus their influence can be understood through how they affect the direct driving forces. Direct and indirect driving forces often produce synergistic effect. Indirect driving forces mainly include population driving force (such as population quantity, age and gender structure, educational level, spatial distribution), economic driving force (such as economic scale, structure of import and export), sociopolitical driving force (such as democratization, status of private social organization, mechanism for solving international frictions), cultural and religious driving force (such as choice of personal consumption concept), technological driving force (such as rate of investment in scientific research and development, rate of new technology adoption, status of development in biotechnology). According to if the various factors could be under the direct control of decision makers, driving force can be classified into internal and external driving force. Decision makers may change internal driving forces, but they canât change external forces; therefore, internal driving forces are under the direct control of decision makers, but external driving forces are not under their control. Decision is generally made via three levels of organization: local level (such as certain farmland or standing forest), regional level (municipal, provincial and national) and global level. The same influencing factor may show changing controllability at different level and different timeframe.17 Some of the influencing factors are exogenic and uncontrollable for decision makers at local level, but turn to be endogenic and controllable at regional level; for instance, national policies are uncontrollable for local government, but controllable for central government. Similarly, some other influencing factors are unchangeable and uncontrollable in short term, but changeable and controllable in the long term, such as technology, which can hardly achieve breakthroughs in short term but can be always changing from the long run. This book mainly addresses the driving forces at regional level. At this level, the internal driving forces of decision making generally include: various systems (such as property right system), service and commoditiesâ price and market, technological innovation,"

While much of the film focuses on victims, survivors and scientistsâ efforts to understand, trace the source of and treat the outbreak, the end of the film provides a critical ârevealâ. A series of brief shots shows the destruction of rainforest, disrupted bats taking refuge in a pig house, a pig sold at a wet market being prepared in a restaurant, an Asian chef with unwashed hands, and an American businesswoman, who then becomes ill, taking the viewer back to the start of the story. This narrative brings together many of the themes found across OH advocacy images. Indeed, Professor Ian Lipkin of Columbia University (an expert in emerging infectious diseases and OH ally) was a key scientific adviser for the film.98 Taken together, what can these images tell us about the sorts of animal bodies and disease that have shaped OH, and which are, in turn, shaped by it? Generic animals, humans and plants play a central roleâwith outlined images of human figures, common animals such as cows, hand-foot-paw prints, and leaves often appearing in OH logos. Reinforcing the verbal messages of OH advocates, they convey an idea of OH as a generic, universal approach that addresses all types of health problem arising at the intersections of humans, animals and environmentâeven though, as shown above, the work performed by researchers adopts a more selective approach to those problems. Once we move beyond the generic animal, more differences begin to open up between their portrayal in OH images, advocacy arguments and OH research. for example, while cows feature in a small number of OH research papers which are largely devoted to bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, they are extremely common in the visual sample. While dogs appear in both, in visual images they feature as family members and veterinary patients, notâas in scientific articlesâas carriers of rabies. Images of charismatic wildlife such as great apes and giraffes are prominent in OH advocacy but extremely rare in OH research. By contrast, animals as experimental models are rarely depicted despite their presence in the research literature. These are obvious promotional choices, making the most of publicly appealing imagery while avoiding drawing attention"
376,974,0.291,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","tribute to wind erosion. Climate change studies indicate warming and drying trends, both in the recent past and future forecasts (Savage et al. 2009). Currently, unsustainable dryland cultivation is the greatest threat to livestock survival during winter, spring, and fall when the high-elevation summer pastures are unavailable. Sustainable dryland cultivation is the greatest threat in terms of the fragmentation of pastoral migration routes and staging areas.22 Both situations will only get worse if climate change scenarios are verified, as more cultivated areas are abandoned in the most fragile landscapes and drought becomes the norm rather than just a temporary or cyclic event. The Ethiopian situation illustrates too many people and livestock (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) exploiting a diminishing natural resource base. This trajectory was predicted over 20 years ago (Coppock 1994). Symptoms are ecological and socioeconomic (Coppock et al. 2014). The former include bush encroachment and gullying on certain soil types. The latter include land-use fragmentation due to de facto privatization of grassland parcels annexed from communal resources, loss of dry-season grazing to maize cultivation, and occupation of former drought grazing reserves by people who have arrived from overpopulated places elsewhere. Bush encroachment has been exacerbated by decades of overgrazing and (past) official bans on the use of prescribed fire that have shifted the competitive balance from perennial grasses to woody plants (Coppock 1994). This loss of grasses means a decline in fine fuels that are needed to carry fires that might otherwise control the recruitment of woody seedlings. Maize cultivation by pastoralists is a food insecurity response to a declining ratio of livestock to people and thus is symptomatic of the trend of increasing poverty (Desta and Coppock 2004). Chronic food insecurity has led to dependence on food aid, the provision of which effectively delays resolving the root causes of hunger (Coppock et al. 2014). The Sahel differs from southern Ethiopia in many respects, but shares some of the same broad outcomes. The Sahelian belt occurs at a continental scale, with far more variation in terms of climate, land use, and rangeland ecology (Table 17.1). Sahelian production systems vary from pure pastoralism to highly integrated agropastoralism where crop residues provide livestock fodder, and livestock manure enhances crop yields (Heasley and Delehanty 1996; Turner et al. 2014). In the Sahel the overall challenge for pastoralists is how to exploit the highly variable occurrence of fodder over space and time most efficiently. Fragmentation of landscapes and natural resource endowments has occurred due to population growth, spread of cultivation, and national policies that attempt to reassert tougher border controls, although efforts have occurred to accommodate pastoral mobility across national borders (Zoundi and Hitimana 2008). In some instances, however, cultivation has remained stable or retreated due to variation in local population growth and climate patterns (Tappan et al. 2004). Pressure on grazing resources from cultivation is particularly a problem in the southern Sahel where seasonal, long-distance livestock movements to the north during the rainy season (e.g., transhumance) have been"

31,21,0.29,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Traditional definitions of medical death are unambiguous, describing a final event that leads to the absolute state of being deadâin which case the biological death of a human being (idem identity) is co-terminus with the social death of the person (ipse identity). The biological death of a person has narrative consequences in how we may configure personal identity. In the most formal terms this involves correct signification. Being dead signifies a corpse, a state of non-being, for which the personal pronoun in the phrase âI am (a corpse)â is no longer correct. A corpse refers to a husk, and a husk is no longer a person that actively possesses a body. Furthermore, physical death has relational consequences for others. My death, for example, would mean that my wife would undergo a relational/narrative change: that is, my wife would become a widow. Social death concerns our ipse identityâthe narrative identity of who we are. While social death is dependent on having existed, it is not necessarily co-terminus with existing as a biological entity. Real changes in our biology certainly prompt relational changes in how we may configure the narratives of our lives. After a heart attack, for example, there may be a subtle shift in who we understand ourselves to be through what we believe we are realistically capable of doing. This may signal a subtle shift in our personality. Less subtly, brain injury, as argued earlier, can lead to narrative inversions in our clinical status: from a living person that is self-conscious and aware of others, to a living human organism which in PVS is not conscious in this way. A relational change in the meaning of who a person is has both an existential as well as a biological dimension. The narrative of who we are is existentially anticipated in the face of our physical mortality. We existentially configure the meaning of our lives in anticipation of our physical death. This has a secular and religious dimension. In secular terms the meaning of our life matters beyond its physical annihilation. For example: we might suffer a serious brain injury that marks our autobiographical death destroying our dignity; we resonably anticipate being respectfully treated and honestly remembered after our physical life has ended. In spiritual/religious terms we may anticipate who we are and how we might continue in a life hereafter. If one believes that how we treat mortal remains matters for a disembodied life hereafter, then the burial rituals associated with keeping the corpse intact take on a special ânarrativeâ significance."
255,141,0.29,Railway Ecology,"regarding the movement of species in ballast waters (Drake and Lodge 2004; Seebens et al. 2016). We speculate that overland transportation of biological stowaways is likely to be less frequent than those by aquatic vehicles; however, we also suspect that the lack of studies for the terrestrial counterpart does not reflect the true contribution of this process for non-native species dispersal. Below we describe a few documented cases where terrestrial transportation had a relevant role on the expansion of biological invaders, with special emphasis on trains. The spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) is an example of a non-native species dispersed by trains. This plant, native to south east and central Europe, arrived in North America in the late 1800s and by the year 2000 it was already found in most contiguous American states (Sheley et al. 1998). The mechanisms that enabled such a fast dispersal were unclear for a long time, but a recent reconstruction of the patterns of invasion of this plant showed a close agreement between the extent of colonized areas and its velocity dispersal on one side, and the spatial coverage and development of the railway network in the USA on the other (Broennimann et al. 2014). For instance, the wave of invasion was much faster and wider in the eastern states, where a denser and older network exists. In favor of the important role of stowaway transportation of this species in trains, particularly for some long-distance dispersal events, is the plantsâ known ability to become attached to the undercarriages of vehicles (Sheley et al. 1998). Trains are known to have been a vehicle of dispersal also for ragwort plant species. One of such cases concerns the South African ragwort (Senecio inaequidens), a species introduced in Europe from South Africa in the ï¬rst half of the twentieth century, and that is now found from Norway in the north to Italy in the south, and from Bulgaria in the east to Spain in the west (Heger and BÃ¶hmer 2006). The achene-type fruit of this species is able to stick to trains in movement or to their transported commodities, a characteristic that contributed to the rapid dispersal of the species along railways systems (Heger and BÃ¶hmer 2005). Another plant of this group known to âhitchhikeâ on trains is the Oxford ragwort (Senecio squalidus), a hybrid that escaped cultivation from the Oxford Botanic Garden. At the end of the eighteenth century it was established in some parts of Oxford (Harris 2002; Heger and BÃ¶hmer 2005), and it currently invades most of Britain. George Druce, an English botanist, described the dispersal of this plant as follows (1927b, p. 241, in Harris 2002): â ... the vortex of air following the express train carries the fruits in its wake. I have seen them enter a railway-carriage window near Oxford and remain suspended in the air in the compartment until they found an exit at Tilehurst [about 40 km from Oxford]â. A few records of animal species being transported as stowaways in trains can also be found in the scientiï¬c literature and the media. Perhaps the most recurrent cases refer to urban pest species, such as rats and mice (Li et al. 2007), but there are also references to ants (Elton 1958), beetles (White 1973), spiders (Nentwig and Kobelt 2010) and even armadillos (Hofmann 2009).

77,49,0.29,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"not all support this hypothesis. For instance there is evidence that the duration of obesity is associated with mortality independent of BMI level. Abdullah et al. (2011) conducted analysis of 5,036 participants from the Framingham cohort study. Using data from 48 years of follow-up, they showed that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality increased with the number of years of obesity; compared with those who were never obese, being obese for 1â4.9, 5â14.9, 15â24.9, and 25 years was associated with adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality of 1.51 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.27â1.79), 1.94 (95 % CI 1.71â2.20), 2.25 (95 % CI 1.89â2.67) and 2.52 (95 % CI 2.08â3.06), respectively. Similar patterns were found for cause-specific mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The relationships were robust to adjustment for current BMI, and were reduced but not completely eliminated by adjustment for potential intermediate factors such as incident cardiovascular disease and diabetes or biomedical risk factors. A large body of research has focused on the topic of whether infancy is a sensitive period in the development of obesity and cardiovascular research. Several studies have concluded that rapid growth in infancy is importantly associated with subsequent obesity and adverse cardiovascular health (Ong et al. 2000, 2009; Ong and Loos 2006). However, these studies have generally only examined changes in weight (or weight adjusted for height) during infancy, and have not considered the associations of growth in later periods of childhood with the same outcomes. Without these comparisons (i.e. determining whether weight change in infancy is more strongly associated with later outcomes than is weight change in later childhood) it is difficult to conclude that infancy is a sensitive period. Studies on this topic have used a variety of statistical methods, often less than ideal (Tilling et al. 2011c; Tu et al. 2013) â for instance, relying on repeated z-scores, an approach which does not model the clustering of measurements within individuals and generally can only include people with complete, non-missing, data at all ages. In ALSPAC and Probit, two large studies with lots of repeated measurements of growth, we have used multilevel models to define growth trajectories across childhood (Howe et al. 2013c; Tilling et al. 2011b); an approach which is appropriate for repeated measures data and which can incorporate missing data under a missing at random assumption. In these analyses, we have not found strong support for infancy as a sensitive period in relation to a wide range of cardiometabolic risk factors, including blood pressure (central and peripheral), glucose, lipids, insulin, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Howe et al. 2010; Tilling et al. 2011a; Anderson et al. 2014). Longitudinal studies also permit in-depth examination of the ways in which the determinants of obesity act throughout the life course, potentially providing deeper aetiological insight than would be possible in cross-sectional studies. For example, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants that are associated with obesity and greater BMI in adulthood. Since BMI changes in childhood can result from changes in both height and weight, examining the effect of the genetic variants on growth trajectories in childhood can provide improved understanding of the potential mechanisms through which the genes are acting (Paternoster et al. 2011; Warrington et al. 2013; Cousminer et al. 2013). Risk scores of obesity-related genetic variants have been shown to be associated with changes in height, weight"

260,234,0.29,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"An appropriate, timely resolution of inflammation is just as important as the induction and progression of this response, because a prolonged inflammatory response increases the risk of tissue damage and host death (Fullerton et al. 2013). Although sparse, there is evidence suggesting that ranavirus infections may exacerbate inflammatory responses, accounting for some of the observed ranavirus pathology. For example, in 1997 a novel iridovirus was isolated in Saskatchewan (Canada) from larval tiger salamanders (Bollinger et al. 1999). These animals suffered from exacerbated inflammation, necrosis, and characteristic ranavirus-induced cytoplasmic inclusions within splenic, renal, lymphoid, and hematopoietic tissues (Bollinger et al. 1999). Similarly, whole populations of ranavirus-infected greenstriped tree dragons (Japalura splendida) exhibited systemic hemorrhaging, necrosis, granulomatous, and necrotic inflammation, as well as severe renal pathology, hyperanemia, and extensive hepatic damage (Behncke et al. 2013), culminating in mass mortality. Ranavirus infection within pythons suggests that inflammation may be a determinant of ranaviral pathology (Hyatt et al. 2002). Mortality of largemouth bass infected intraperitoneally with largemouth bass virus (LMBV) is believed to result from virally induced inflammation and associated necrosis (Zilberg et al. 2000). Consistent with these inflammatory symptoms, juvenile bass inoculated with LMBV exhibited corkscrew swimming and distended abdomens (Zilberg et al. 2000). Notably, the deeper tissues of infected fish were unaffected, bringing into question whether virus-induced damage was due to target cell accessibility or the limitations of LMBV cell tropism. The latter suggests that inflammation and necrotic damage resulting in mortality may be the result of primary injuries at the initial sites of infection. Indeed, the above observations are reminiscent of earlier studies of FV3 infections in rodents (Gut et al. 1981; Kirn et al. 1980, 1982), in which, despite the inability of FV3 to replicate at 37 Â°C (Aubertin et al. 1973), the initial viral inoculum was responsible for extensive inflammation, necrosis, and liver damage."
231,176,0.29,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.2 Harmful Algal Blooms Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been reported in several regions of the North Sea and linked to changes in nutrients, temperature, salinity, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (ICES 2011). Their relation to anthropogenic drivers is unclear. Harmful algal blooms may impact ecosystem function and thus influence economic functions, including human health. However, several species known to cause HABs (e.g. Phaeocystis spp., and several dinoflagellates and raphidophytes) were already present in the North Sea at the beginning of 20th century (Peperzak 2003). Laboratory studies indicate that a rise in temperature may enhance growth, but that not all species tested responded in the same way (Peperzak 2003). 1.6.3.3 Offshore Oil and Gas Vast oil and gas reserves formed during the North Seaâs long geological history are currently being exploited. A large number of oil and gas production platforms widely distributed over the North Sea are responsible for supplying energy to European countries. Waters around the platforms are sometimes contaminated by chemicals including substances that affect benthic communities. Detailed studies showed effects of drilling activities (discharge of oil-based muds) only up to about 1 km from the platform (Daan and Mulder 1996). 1.6.3.4 Renewable Energy As the use of renewable energy from offshore wind farms and from wave/tidal power plants increases, so the threat to seabirds and marine mammals will increase. The long-term impacts of renewable energy infrastructure on the North Sea ecosystem are not yet clear. Initial studies based on a UK wind farm show that plant and animal growth on piles may offer a substantial additional food supply for marine mammals. Studies by Garthe (Kiel University, unpubl.) on telemetered northern gannet Morus bassanus from Helgoland show birds can avoid wind farms to some extent."

182,355,0.29,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"ANIMAL PATIENTS Surprisingly little is known about the history of animal patients. This is partly because many animal victims of disease were not awarded this role: they were killed or left to suffer and die rather than being cared for clinically by owners and healers. It is also because historians have not tended to study the sorts of animals and diseases that resulted in the treatment of animals as patients. In focusing on the interests of humans rather than animals, their accounts privilege the effects of infectious animal diseases on the health of humans, animal populations and the agricultural economy. They rarely consider the implications of disease for individual and small groups of highly valued animals that were more likely to be subjected to clinical interventions: Abigail Woods. âAnimals and Disease.â In Routledge History of Disease, edited by Mark Jackson, 147â64.

218,19,0.289,Sustainable Development in The Jordan Valley : Final Report of The Regional Ngo Master Plan,"Region such as by GLOWA (2008). Overall, these impacts include a foreseen reduction in local annual water resources with a maximum of 20 % by 2050 and increasing temperatures and related surface water evaporation rates. The Jordan Valley is characterized by a wide range of bioclimatological and physical conditions, and its location at the crossroads of climatic and botanic regions endows the area with a rich variety of plant and animal life. For example, a total of 20 species of large mammals belonging to six orders have been recorded in the Valley. Among them, four species are considered at risk according to the IUCN red list of threatened species. Moreover, 18 bat species were found along the Jordan Valley, two of them are considered endangered or threatened on a global scale. Around spring and autumn, the Jordan Valley serves as an important migration route for some 500 Million migrant species, flying between Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and Africa. Some of these species are currently considered threatened on a global scale by the IUCN and Birdlife International. Most importantly, large portions, or even entire bird populations, pass through the Jordan Valley, as it serves as a bottleneck for bird migration. An analysis of the environmental flow requirements for the river indicates that the physical characteristics of the flow are the most important ecological factor for enabling macro-invertebrates. Less water in the LJR caused changes to the stream channel, resulting in a narrower and more canalized river ecosystem. Less water has also resulted in much slower velocities, reducing the habitats depending on flows, such as falls, cascades, and rapids. Less water in the river also means less dilution with inflowing polluted water, such as brackish (ground) water or wastewater. This leads to higher salinity and pollution concentrations in the river stream. As a result, the ecology of the river is now reduced to pockets of high-resistant and medium-to-slow velocity habitats. In thewestern part of the Jordan Valley, a total of 44 natural reserves and national parks have been assigned by Israel from Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It should be noted that the nature reserves in the West Bank have been established by Israel unilaterally without the consent or cooperation with the Palestinians. A total of 28 of these nature reserves are entirely located inside the project boundaries, while the areas of the rest are crossed by the projectâs boundaries. The total protected areas north of Bezeq stream is 61 km2, while the total protected areas south of the Bezeq stream as deï¬ned by Israel amount to 117.5 km2. The areas of the natural reserves and national parks north of Bezeq stream tend to be smaller than those in the Palestinian West Bank. The protected natural reserves in Jordan are mainly located outside the Jordan Valley."
222,218,0.289,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Bangladesh ranks fifth in the WorldRiskIndex for disaster risk related to natural disasters in 2016 (Comes et al. 2016). Around 26 per cent of the population are affected by cyclones, while 70 per cent live in flood-prone regions (Cash et al. 2013). The coastal delta is particularly vulnerable to cyclones and tidal surges owing to its low elevation (Chap. 8). Other hazards that the coastal area is exposed to include coastal and river erosion and water logging from polders. Since the 1950s changes in extreme weather events have been observed (IPCC 2014). In Bangladesh weather and extreme weather were found to be associated with mortality (Lindeboom et al. 2012). In Abhoynagar, a rural coastal sub-district of Bangladesh, it was found that heavy rainfall was associated with mortality (Lindeboom et al. 2012). Extreme precipitation events and higher temperatures are likely to cause widespread food-borne and water-borne disease outbreaks including cholera and other diarrheal diseases. Cholera (Vibrio cholerae) outbreaks have been shown to be linked to rising sea surface temperatures which trigger the release of cholera into the environment. Cholera risk may be exacerbated by coastal and estuarine water warming or by local flooding (RodÃ³ et al. 2002; Lipp et al. 2002). Thus it was found that cholera risk in Bangladesh increases with the increase in sea surface temperature (Shahid 2009). Increased precipitation in the country has been also linked to increased non-cholera diarrhoea (Hashizume et al. 2007). Bangladesh is highly prone to flooding because of its location at the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) rivers and because of the hydro-meteorological and topographical characteristics of the GBM delta (Mirza 2002). On average, annual floods inundate around 20 per cent of the country and can reach up to 70 per cent during an extreme flood event (Mirza 2002). As a result about two-thirds of the tube-wells and all toilets have become unusable in Bangladesh (Annya et al. 2010). During floods water supply and sanitation condition becomes severely disrupted and allows the spread of various water-borne diseases. Low-lying coastal regions across the world are prone to salt water intrusion due to sea-level rise (Chap. 17 and 18). In Bangladesh, the south-west coast is subject to additional drivers of salinity ingress such as"

The challenge is to ï¬nd meaningful and robust indicators to quantify ecosystem services, measure changes in demand and supply and predict future scenarios. At present, most governments are not effectively measuring or monitoring ecosystem services. This chapter addresses the basic requirements for collecting information on ecosystem services."

The authors also investigate the linkages between ecosystem services and aspects of extreme poverty. Their findings suggest that the poor are often more vulnerable to the loss of ecosystem function that restricts the supply of natural goods and services. The poor depend upon ecosystem services, but the nature of this dependence is necessarily not uniform throughout the year. The poor also tend to benefit less from environmental conservation efforts than those who are not poor. The dynamic patterns of dependence on ecosystem services of the poor and their coping strategies require regionally specific and in-depth evaluation.

Of course, since the publication of Peter Singerâs influential Animal Liberation (1975), the interests of animals are less likely to be omitted from the utilitarian calculus, but few if any experimenters value animal lives on a level with human ones. Singerâs own commitment to their interests did not extend to calling for the abolition of vivisection, and the balanced position he expressed in 1980 is very close to the view of the medical research community today: The knowledge gained from some experiments on animals does save lives and reduce suffering. Hence, the benefits of animal experimentation exceed the benefits of eating animals and the former stands a better chance of being justifiable than the latter; but this applies only when an experiment on an animal fulfils strict conditions relating to the significance of the knowledge to be gained, the unavailability of alternative techniques not involving animals, and the care taken to avoid pain. Under these conditions the death of an animal in an experiment can be defended.6"

246,50,0.289,Rewilding European Landscapes,"If the abandoned land is too degraded assisted regeneration may be needed (Cramer et al. 2008). Active restoration would involve large-scale native trees plantation and tree growth management (Rey Benayas et al. 2008). An intermediate level of intervention involves the creation and management of forest regeneration sources or âwoodland isletsâ (Rey Benayas and Bullock 2012; see Chap. 7). Another problem often requiring intervention is the vulnerability of intermediate stages of natural succession to natural perturbations, such as invasive species (Kull et al. 2004; Stoate et al. 2009) and fire (Pausas et al. 2008). Fire is a particularly acute problem as it has impacts not only on biodiversity but also on human health (ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2010b). If fire regime is not appropriately managed, frequent fires will favor fire-prone scrubland and halt succession towards forest, in a selfreinforcing feedback loop (ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2010a). One of the strategies to manage fire regimes is to maintain open spaces in the landscape (see Chap. 8), minimizing also the impacts of revegetation on species that prefer open areas (Fig. 1.2). This strategy can be implemented by increasing the populations of large herbivores (Hodder and Bullock 2009; Sutherland 2002), including reintroduction of extinct species (Svenning 2002). In the case of species regionally extinct, it is possible to use individuals from other populations. For instance, seven European bison were recently reintroduced in northern Spain, 1,000 years after their extinction (Burton 2011). A more complex situation occurs with species that are globally extinct, such as wild relatives of some domesticated species. A possible solution is to release into the wild individuals of breeds that are most likely to be successful in replacing the ecological role of their wild ancestors. For instance, Iceland ponies have been released in the former arable fields of the Dutch-Belgian border (Kuiters and Slim 2003): their grazing favored a dense grass sward and after 27 years open grassland still represented 98 % of the area. Natural colonization of abandoned land by carnivores can also be limited by the availability of prey, as is the case for the Iberian lynx ( Lynx pardinus) currently negatively affected by the scarcity of rabbits, decimated by diseases (DelibesMateos et al. 2008), or as can be expected for some populations of wolves and bears currently preying on livestock (Russo 2006). Rewilding may be a future option in areas that are undergoing agricultural development or intensification today. There is currently a debate between land sharing and land sparing approaches to reconcile food production with biodiversity (Phalan et al. 2011). In land sharing, biodiversity conservation and food production goals are met on the same land, with biodiversity friendly agricultural practices and extensive agriculture, whereas in land sparing, land is divided between areas of intensification and of exclusion of agriculture. In practice, it is difficult to determine which is the best option because species respond differently to the alteration of their habitat (Phalan et al. 2011). To maintain future options for rewilding, both land sparing and land sharing are needed. On the one hand, land sharing is essential to limit land degradation and to maintain the appropriate seed bank for future passive revegetation (see Chap. 7). On the other hand, land sparing would allow for the conservation of populations of species that are currently in conflict with human activities, making âcohabitationâ very difficult."

Those human interventions were often made at local-to-reach scale.

See also Huhn (2016) for a compelling comparative case from Northern Mozambique of a transformation of a corpse into a sorcerous âhumanlionâ, as she terms it. Upon seeing visible changes to the corpse, including the development of hide, the mourners undertook several steps to dismember, open and crack the body, succeeding only after several days in blocking the emergence of a âhuman-lionâ. 6. However, consuming food alone does not unambiguously index antisocial behaviour: in popular corruption discourses in several African countries, âeatâ covers the physical act of consuming food as well as a person engaging in corruption (see also Argenti 2007: 88f; Bayart 1993). Paradoxically, then, eating with others signifies specific anti-social, colluding and predatory forms of communities of corrupt consumption, if I may call it that. This latter form refers more to nocturnal necrophagous feasts of a society of muroiârather than families sharing their meals among themselves or with visitors (see also Geschiere 1995). 7. Transgressive acts to increase agricultural yields have a long history across Africa. Hilda Kuperâs (Kuper 1963: 66) reference to two main types of âmurders for doctoringâ were âagricultural fertilityâ and âpersonal aggrandisementâ. Burbridge (1925: 26) also notes, and condemns, this: âPerhaps in no instance does the sinister influence of this man [the âwitch-doctorâ] appear in darker colours than in the conditions annexed to the use of this agricultural charm divisi. These conditions, sometimes incestuous, sometimes murderous, always inhuman and unnatural, were eagerly complied with by the superstitious idler, not witting that by the sweat of his brow he must eat his bread. In sloth, he sat with his friendly benefactor by his side pulling the right string to set the mechanical forces free which were to fill his grain-bin.â 8. Enslaving others to work in a garden was documented by H. A. Junod (1962 [1912]: 514f). On this form of enslavement or âzombificationâ, see also Beidelmann (1963: 66) and Ellis and Haar (2004: 123). On sacrifices, such as the killing of relatives and the use of their body parts, and on illicit medicine or drugs to augment yields, see Marwick (1965: 80) and Gelfand (1964: 71â72). Agricultural or economic productivity is sometimes also conceived of in terms of reflecting incestuous relations, which are often understood in relation to the language of sorcery; see Jacobson-Widding (1990: 54) and Aschwanden (1982 [1976]: 101f). 9. There has been much discussion about Pentecostalism and its effects on sociocultural, gendered and economic realities in African as well as Melanesian contexts: Joel Robbins (2004), Matthew Engelke (2010) and Birgit Meyer (2004) have influenced much of this debate.

These abiotic changes will almost certainly lead to subsequent changes in species composition and biogeochemical cycling that can irreversibly alter the system from its historic condition (Seastedt et al. 2008). In addition to abiotic changes, biotic modifications may also contribute to the development of novel ecosystems. These biotic changes may include new species invasions (plants or animals, including livestock), local extinction of keystone species or ecosystem engineers. While some ecosystems remain intact, many, if not most, are novel and have an altered structure and function with unprecedented combinations of species under new abiotic conditions, compared to historic systems. This is an important starting point for the development and prioritization of invasive species management programs (Seastedt et al. 2008; Perring et al. 2013). However, it is likely that these novel systems are capable of further transformation and may not necessarily represent a resilient community. This is an important consideration in identifying desired outcomes and long-term management strategies that are designed to maximize ecosystem function and services, yet build and maintain ecological resilience (Eviner et al. 2012). Innovation, adaptation, and social flexibility will be required to attain these goals (Seastedt et al. 2008). Many restoration efforts have the objective of recreating the historic landscape, despite the uncertainty associated with what is actually the ânaturalâ ecosystem (Hobbs et al. 2009; Jackson and Hobbs 2009). In most cases outside of Europe and Asia, for example, the historic or ânaturalâ ecosystem is defined as what was present before Europeans exerted their widespread influence on landscapes (Black et al. 2006; Bowman 1998). The goal of restoring ecosystems back to their ânaturalâ state can only be effective when the historic range of variability in abiotic and biotic feedback mechanisms are still present (Seastedt et al. 2008). This may be feasible in some systems, for example, high elevation meadows, forests and riparian areas or remote and isolated wildlands, where invasive species have had only a limited impact. Alternatively, if the definition of a historic system is broadened to include a certain amount of modification and addition of new species, it may not be possible to conserve or restore the site to near-historic conditions, yet it may represent a functionally similar system (Hobbs et al. 2009). With an even broader definition of a historic system, it is possible to restore the key features and functions of the ecosystem, without the constraint of eliminating all nonindigenous species. Land managers need to take these considerations into account when assessing the feasibility of success, economic realities, and even intrinsic cultural values. While restoration to a historic or near-historic ecosystem is possible in some cases, the abiotic and biotic feedbacks may have been so dramatically altered for many rangelands that they now represent novel ecosystems with unique assemblages of species and functions that have no analog to historic systems (Hobbs et al. 2009). Novel ecosystem recovery to conditions resembling historic conditions through restoration is considered very unlikely or impossible (Jackson and Hobbs 2009; Seastedt et al. 2008). Consequently, restoration programs should focus on managing for future change that emphasizes ecosystem function, goods, and services (Hobbs et al. 2011), maintaining genetic and species diversity, and"
233,114,0.288,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"The Importance of Phylogeny in Conservation Why We Need to Evaluate Extinction Risk within a Phylogenetic Framework Phylogenetic approaches are now well accepted in many ecological disciplines. Phylogenetic methods are also increasingly commonplace in extinction biology (see Purvis 2008). The necessity of employing a phylogenetic framework for exploring a non-evolving trait such as risk of extinction has been questioned (Grandcolas et al. 2011). Reasons for doing so are multifold. First, as we have discussed above, many drivers of extinction risks can be linked to phylogenetically conserved traits, such as body mass (Cardillo et al. 2005, 2008) and phenology (Willis et al. 2008, 2010). Therefore, phylogenetic comparative methods, such as independent contrasts (Felsenstein 1985) or phylogenetic regression are important because species cannot be considered as statistically independent (see Purvis 2008 for further discussion). Second, species evolutionary history might itself be an important predictor of extinction risk, for example, with higher risks associated with either more evolutionarily distinct lineages (Purvis et al. 2000a; Mace et al. 2003) or centres of diversiï¬cation (Davies et al. 2011), depending on the clade and taxonomic scale. Third, by considering extinction within a phylogenetic framework, we can quantify directly its impacts on the tree-of-life as the loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD) (Purvis et al. 2000a; Mace et al. 2003). This measure of evolutionary heritage provides a useful conservation metric, typically measured in millions of years, it is easily comprehendible, and simple to calculate for particular regions or taxa (Mooers et al. 2005). Although, there remain practical obstacles in the implementation of phylogenetic approaches for conservation planning, there is now increasing appreciation of the importance of including an evolutionary perspective within conservation goals, as illustrated by the Zoological Society of Londonâs EDGE of existence programme (http://www.edgeofexistence.org/) that emphasises the conservation of evolutionary distinct and threatened species (Isaac et al. 2007)."

231,1183,0.288,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"that it might not be sustained at, or expected to recover to, levels observed in the past (Jennings and Blanchard 2004). Cook and Heath (2005) examined the relationship between sea surface temperature and recruitment in a number of North Sea ï¬sh species (cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole) and concluded that if the recent warming period were to continue, as suggested by climate models, stocks which express a negative relationship with temperature (including cod) might be expected to support much smaller ï¬sheries in the future. In the case of cod, climate change has been estimated to have been eroding the maximum sustainable yield at a rate of 32,000 tonnes per decade since 1980. Calculations show that the North Sea cod stock, could still support a sustainable ï¬shery under a warmer climate but only at very much lower levels of ï¬shing mortality, and that current âprecautionary referenceâ limits or targets (such as FMSY), calculated by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on the basis of historic time series, may be unrealistically optimistic in the future. For Atlantic mackerel, increases in sea surface temperature are known to affect growth, recruitment and migration with subsequent impacts on permissible levels of exploitation (Jansen and Gislason 2011). Jansen et al. (2012) used information on larval ï¬sh from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) to show that abundance has declined dramatically in the North Sea since the 1970s and also that the spatial distribution of mackerel larvae seems to have changed. Whether these trends can be ascribed to changes in climatic conditions remains unclear, although development and/or mortality of mackerel eggs is known to be very sensitive to seawater temperature (Mendiola et al. 2007). There have been many attempts to include climatic variables in single-species population models (e.g. Hollowed et al. 2009), and thereby to project how the productivity of ï¬sh stocks will be affected by climate change in the future. Particular emphasis has been placed on climatic determinants of ï¬sh recruitment, and indeed several studies have inserted temperature or other environmental terms within the âstock-recruitâ relationship in order to make medium or long-term forecasts. Clarke et al. (2003) used projections of future North Sea temperatures and estimated the likely impact of climate change on the reproductive capacity of cod, assuming that the high level of mortality inflicted by the ï¬shing industry (in 2003) continued into the future. Outputs from the model suggested that the cod population would decline, even without a signiï¬cant temperature increase. However, scenarios with higher rates of temperature increase resulted in faster rates of decline. In a re-analysis by Kell et al. (2005), the authors modelled the effect of introducing a âcod recovery planâ (as being implemented by the European Commission), under which catches were set each year so that stock biomass increased by 30 % annually until the cod stock had recovered to around 150,000 tonnes. The length of"
364,240,0.288,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"The Path to Food Entitlement Crop losses affect the amount of food available for a family and the amount of food surplus that can be sold for cash to purchase other basic needs. The incidence of food insecurity is therefore influenced by the farming systems adopted (crops grown, number and density of crops, etc.), as well as anthropogenic or biogenic hazards or risks encountered in farm production, and the consequent effect on the familyâs access to food. Difficulties in Meeting Household Expenditures Across sites, the majorityâif not almost allâof the respondents indicated that they have problems or difficulties in meeting their expenses for even the most important household expenditures. These include food (10â58 %) and farming/fishery inputs (33â69 %). For all sites, the main reasons for problems in paying for their household needs include the seasonal and irregular flow of income, crop losses from typhoons and seasonal climate variations, the high costs of agricultural inputs, and the difficulty of reducing expenses and making other household adjustments. In the upstream and midstream sites, 44 % are below the 2009 NSCB food poverty threshold of PHP 14,040 for the province of Cavite, while 52 % in the upper downstream site and 26 % in the lower downstream site are below the NSCB food poverty threshold of PHP 12,150 for the province of Laguna. Food expenditures include basic necessities such as rice, fish, sugar, coffee, cooking oil, and in some instances canned goods, flavorings, milk, and meat. Rice is bought by the majority of the households across the watershed. Pandey in his report (2008, as cited in RaÃ±ola 2010â2011) indicated that in developing countries like the Philippines, poor people spend 30â50 % of their income on rice. However, with the price of rice increasing by as much as 50 %, this means an equivalent drop in their real income of 15â25 %, a substantial loss for poor people who are hovering just above the poverty line. Sources of Entitlement, Risks in Farm/Fishery Production, and Seasonal Food Insecurity The ability of households and their members to acquire enough food through production, exchange, or transfer depends on their current sources of entitlement. These include their productive assets, such as their land, tools, and equipment, as well as their farm-related entitlements such as the number or density of crops planted, combinations of crop species, period of harvesting and/or production cycle, total land area for cultivation, and the actual farm size cultivated. Other important sources of entitlement include labor resources, education and health, size of the family, level of income, and nature and sources of income. These factors are related to householdsâ levels of poverty and food poverty thresholds as estimated by the NSCB. However, for households in the Silang Santa-Rosa subwatershed, sources of entitlement are limited, and this is compounded by their regular exposure over time to combinations of farm risks and uncertainty (both natural and anthropogenic)."

The genetics of âfoundation speciesâ, those that structure their environment, such as trees and corals, could be particularly important as heritable changes in these species could affect entire ecosystems. The ï¬eld of community genetics (Whitham et al. 2008) has tended to focus on genetic surveys of key indicator species of ecosystems, often including vegetation (Bailey 2011; Zytynska et al. 2012). Indicators or foundation species may be a ï¬rst priority to monitor. An alternative approach may be to choose representatives from key functional groups within ecosystems, standard practice in microbial community genetics (Nannipieri et al. 2003; He et al. 2007), and routinely applied in animal and plant ecology. Wild species that are commercially relevant such as marine and freshwater ï¬sh, timber trees, crop pests and large predators have seen an explosion in genetic studies during the last three decades, focusing on DNA barcoding for species identiï¬cation and wildlife forensics (e.g., MinhÃ³s et al. 2013), delineation of commercial stocks using population genetics approaches (e.g., Nielsen et al. 2012), genetic assignment of individuals or their products to source population (e.g., Lowe and Cross 2011) and assessing the impacts of anthropogenic barriers such as roads or dams to the movement of individuals (e.g., Keller and Largiader 2003). Such approaches are directly influencing policy and management, enabling law enforcement helping authorities to prioritise their direct interventions and redeï¬ne populations for exploitation management."

This has been shown for a range of taxonomic groups (Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Parmesan 2006).

For instance, EHNV can persist in fish tissues frozen at â20 and â70 Â°C for more than 2 years and for at least 7 days at 4 Â°C (Langdon 1989). EHNV is also persistent for long periods in distilled water (i.e., no decrease in titer over 97 days at 15 Â°C) and in tissue culture medium dried on sterile plastic Petri dishes (between 113 and 200 days at 15 Â°C in the dark; Langdon 1989).

Human impacts such as ditching or management practices such as livestock grazing (and then soil compaction) can also affect processes related to hydrodynamics, vegetation composition, and sediment deposition. Although many salt marshes tend to have a ânaturalâ appearance, some along the mainland coast result from human interference. Salt marshes emerged about 2500 years BP after the last glacial period. Apart from small-scale embankments from the Roman period onward, most of the coastline became protected by seawalls about 1000 AD, thus reducing brackish marshes further inland and disconnecting them from the salt marshes. Peat reclamation along the coastline and subsidence behind the seawalls combined with sudden falls in the human population due to disease in the Medieval period, made the embankments vulnerable to attack by the sea. This resulted in societal collapse and a subsequent inability to maintain the seawalls that protected the embankments (Wolff 1992). This resulted in embayments such as the Lauwerszee, Dollard (the Netherlands), Leybucht (Germany), and subsequent new salt-marsh development. In past centuries, extensive areas of salt marsh have been embanked for coastal protection and agricultural exploitation (Dijkema 1987). Currently, a decline in the pioneer zone and increase in the high marsh zone in the Wadden Sea has been reported (Esselink et al. 2009).

219,851,0.287,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Land Degradation on Grazing Lands Impact of Land Degradation or Improvement on Livestock Productivity We assess livestock productivity using beef and milk offtake only. This approach ignores other effects of pasture degradation such as parturition and mortality rate. Parturition could increase while mortality rate could fall due to better pasture intake. Ruï¬no et al. (2009) ï¬nd that adding supplements to diets increases calving rate among smallholder Kenyan dairy farms. Huttner et al. (2001) reports that malnutrition is a major factor predisposing cattle to poor health among Malawian smallholders. Like the case for crops, we estimate the impact of grazing biomass change on livestock productivity using two scenarios: Business as usual (BAU)âContinuous grazing and improved pasture management ârotational grazing which allows natural regeneration of grasslands. Choice of rotational grazing as an improved forage management is done due to the observation that a number of farmers reported to have used it. Consistent with Havlic et al. (2014), forage productivity under continuous and rotational grazing was estimated using EPIC model estimated in Sokoto Nigeria by Izzaraulde (2010). The biophysical and socio-economic characteristics of the sites selected in Sokoto were comparable with those selected in Southern Niger (Nkonya et al. 2015). Grazing biomass productivity under BAU and rotational grazing was simulated with the EPIC model, establishing a generic, perennial C4 species and grazing regime during the rainy season (June 1âOctober 31) and a livestock density of 1 TLU/ha. Continuous grazing was set such that animals could continue grazing until biomass reduces to a minimum amount of plant dry matter of 0.1 Mg/ha. Rotational grazing scenario allowed 15-day resting periods in-between to allow for grass natural regeneration. It is important to establish the feed requirement of grazing animals and match this with available pasture. The feed requirement will provide the potential productivity of livestock. Assuming the animals feed on forage with speciï¬c nutrient properties, the quantity of feed intake will vary depending on the characteristics of the animal. Speciï¬cally, the body weight, growth rate, milk production, and activity level of the animal will jointly determine the level of intake required. StÃ©phenne and Lambin (2001) estimated the DM biomass consumption per TLULivestock in the Sahelian zone to be 4.6 tons/year based on the following: â¢ Average daily dietary requirements are 6.25 kg DM per TLU (HouÃ©rou and Hoste 1977; Behnke and Scoones 1993; Leeuw and Tothill 1993). â¢ Consumable forage of grasses is only one-third of the above-ground biomass (Penning de Vries and DjitÃ¨ye 1982; Leeuw and Tothill 1993). This means requirement must be multiplied by a factor of 3 to account for this. â¢ Shrubs, trees and crops residues contribute 33 % of livestock biomass requirements (HouÃ©rou and Hoste 1977; Pieri 1989)."

169,732,0.287,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"In the Austrian stretch of river Danube (approx. 350 km), ten hydropower stations/ impoundments have been implemented within the last 70 years. All of them massively affect the ï¬sh fauna. The most threatened ï¬sh are those of the rheophilic guild, which was dominant during pristine conditions. Straightening the river channel at larger scales started in the 1850s. Their further development favored lacustrine as well as eurytopic species at the same time that it decreased abundances and occurrences of riverine species by shortening free-ï¬owing habitats and cutting off side arms. Impoundments deny rheophilic ï¬sh a number of structures found in free-ï¬owing river stretches: suitable gravel spawning grounds, small- and large-scale inshore structures for nursery and juvenile development, and shelters in times of ï¬ood events and winter situation as well as proper food security. As a consequence, ï¬sh ecological research shows an extreme decrease of riverine adults in the central impoundments, and successful reproduction is only possible in small, restricted areas of running waters with gravel habitats in the tail water of the dams. However, in impoundments stronger development of eurytopic and lacustrine ï¬sh species is hampered by comparatively low water temperatures, low plankton density needed as starter feed for their larvae, a lack of macrophytes as spawning habitats, and a lack of structured refuge and nursery habitats. Based on these abiotic and biotic conditions, a Danube impoundment does not serve the development of a proper life cycle for riverine ï¬sh or for lacustrine communities. Eurytopic species are most likely to accept suboptimal conditions, and therefore in most impoundments a very limited number of eurytopic species dominate the ï¬sh fauna. Planning and constructing of the latest Danube hydropower plant at âFreudenauâ (operation started 1998) considered a variety of ecological measures to improve the biotic integrity of the affected river section. Large-scale habitat constructionsâbased on the lessons learned at other impoundmentsâinclude double-riprap secured gravel banks, creation of massive inshore riverbed structures, a bypass system for ï¬sh migration, and creation/connection/integration to riparian backwaters and side arms. Results from the ï¬sh assemblages as seen in Fig. 24.11 pinpoint the positive ecological development of the central impounded area only when riparian side arms and structures are situated. Because of âagingâ of the constructed riparian elements, succession happens in the riparian vegetation as well as in the habitat morphology, and hence continuous human management and maintenance are vital to sustain the habitatâs functioning. Given the scale that humans use the riverâs ï¬ow to satisfy such needs as electricity, in response habitat management has to secure the functioning of ecological improvements to guarantee future ï¬sh stocks for next generations.

They might also accept compromises in the acquisition of experimental primates: for instance, wild-caught animals, often seen as local pests, could be used instead of purpose-bred animals. Furthermore, the application of the âThree Rsâ â replacement, reduction and reï¬nement1 â is likely to be less stringent, particularly regarding reï¬nement strategies in the housing and husbandry of the animals, and even more so in the experimental design of studies (e.g. the implementation of severity limits and humane endpoints)."

255,117,0.287,Railway Ecology,"Habitat Management Vegetation mowing at railway verges was successfully applied to reduce moose WTCs in Norway, and it could have had three complementary beneï¬ts: ï¬rst, reducing the attractiveness of the verges for animals, therefore reducing foraging close to railways (Jaren et al. 1991; Andreassen et al. 2005); second, reducing the time spent by animals close to the railway, as they could perceive the clearing as dangerous (Jaren et al. 1991); and, third, allow them âsee and be seenâ rule, as provided for both the train driver and the animal, with a greater amount of time to react to each other and avoid a collision (Jaren et al. 1991). This technique reduced the number of moose WTCs by half (Jaren et al. 1991; Andreassen et al. 2005). On the contrary, Eriksson (2014) originally hypothesized that tree-clearing could be the factor behind the increase in moose and roe deer train collisions in Sweden, as early successional stages created after mowing provided attractive foraging opportunities for ungulates, but she found that it had no effect on the increase of WTCs in her âBefore-After-Control-Impactâ, the so-called BACI design (Eriksson 2014). Finally, it is worth mentioning that vegetation removal may increase barrier effects for small vertebrates, as these do not cross open spaces due to their associated high predation risks (Hunt et al. 1987; Yanes et al. 1995)."

However, the occurrence of Phragmites on the outer portions of the delta is a mixed blessing. On one hand, Phragmites populations stabilize an easily erodible landscape (Rooth and Stevenson 2000) and protect the more diverse and fragile interior marshes of the delta (Hauber et al. 2011). On the other hand, Phragmites populations provide little in the way of habitat and food for migrating waterfowl that overwinter in the Mississippi River delta (Hauber et al. 1991). The Phragmites marshes of the Mississippi Riverâs Birdfoot Delta are unique in that they contain the most phenotypically and genetically diverse Phragmites populations in the world (Hauber et al. 2011). The most common phenotype, known as the Delta phenotype, tends to occur in the outer portions of the delta and is considered the oldest Phragmites lineage in the Birdfoot Delta (Hauber et al. 1991; Fournier et al. 1995; White et al. 2004a). More recently the interior marshes of the delta have been colonized by at least two other lineages, the Gulf Coast subspecies and the introduced haplotype M, which has Eurasian origins (Hauber et al. 2011).

55,149,0.287,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"1997.109 The data they collected showed that âdeaths in which an infectious disease was the underlying cause, those due to mycoses increased from the tenth most common in 1980 to the seventh most common in 1997â, with the annual number of deaths increasing from 1,557 to 6,534. They confirmed that there had been âa marked upward trend in overall mortality due to the invasive mycosesâ, and highlighted the growing importance of immuno-compromising conditions, particularly HIV/AIDS.110 What was interesting was that the regionally specific mycoses discussed in this chapter only registered in the summary when they affected patients with HIV/AIDS, indeed, the disease was âa major determinant of the trend in overall mortality from histoplasmosisâ.111 However, the report supported the view that social changes were major factors in the fluctuating incidence of fungal disease, as with coccidioidomycosis in Arizona, where the increase was due to âan influx into the state of older nonimmune individuals who were susceptible to acute infection and more likely to manifest symptomatic illnessâ.112 In other places, it was not so much the arrival of virgin human soil, but the wider and more intense circulation of the âseedsâ of infection, literally thrown up by construction and extreme climate events. In discussing overall mortality, the CDC report confirmed what doctorsâ experience had told them: The two major factors responsible for the emergence of fungal infections have been the HIV disease epidemic and the many advances of modern medicine (including solid organ and bone marrow transplantation) that enable or prolong the survival of critically ill and susceptible patients. In addition, the aging of the population has increased the number of susceptible persons.113 To which should be added greater medical awareness, plus new and more sensitive diagnostic technologies. However, the report showed that antifungal drugs had reduced mortality in certain groups and from certain infections; the main exception was aspergillosis, the mycosis most associated with âadvances in modern medicineâ, which we move on to in the next chapter.

An assessment of vulnerability specific to California was conducted for several reasons. First, because of the large volume of CPY used in that state (Fig. 1); second, the historical detections of CPY reported from monitoring studies conducted in the state (CDPR 2012a; CEPA 2011a, b; USGS 2013); third, the availability of detailed records on pesticide applications from the California Department of Pesticide Regulationâs (CDPR) Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) database (CDPR 2012b); and fourth, because of the intensive use of furrow and flood irrigation on crops registered for use with CPY in the state (Orang et al. 2008). Losses in furrow and flood irrigation tail-water have been identified as a major cause of transport of pesticides, including CPY, to nontarget aquatic systems (Budd et al. 2009; Gill et al. 2008; Long et al. 2010; Starner et al. 2005). This pathway could not be simulated with the National Pesticide Assessment (NPAT) model. The assessment of vulnerability for California was conducted using the Cooccurrence of Pesticides and Species Tool (CoPST), a modeling framework developed by the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) to evaluate the potential spatial and temporal co-occurrence of pesticides with threatened or endangered aquatic and semi-aquatic species (Hoogeweg et al. 2011). The framework integrates a number of databases necessary for temporal and spatial analysis, including historical records of pesticide use and soil properties, weather records, agronomic data, and species habitat for the Sacramento River, San Joaquin, and the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary watersheds (SI Appendix C). Using the modeling framework, daily pesticide runoff and erosion losses in the Central Valley of CA were estimated for historical CPY applications to agricultural fields. Approximately 47,860 historical applications of CPY were simulated for the period 2000â2008."

After 14-d exposures of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to 0.325 Î¼g CPY Lâ1, activity of whole-body AChE was 22% of that in control fish (van der Wel and Welling 1989). Following removal to clean water for a further 14 d, activity of AChE had recovered to 40% of that in control fish. Similar observations have been reported for other organophosphorus insecticides. For example, activity of brain-AChE in Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo salar) exposed to formulated fenitrothion (50% inhibition at initiation of recovery) and transferred to fresh water, recovered to 66% of control values in 7 d and 93% in 42 d (Morgan et al. 1990). It is not known if AChE recovery rates in fish differ among organophosphorus insecticides having O-methyl (fenitrothion) or O-ethyl (CPY) substituents, and whether there are models, with which recovery rates can be extrapolated. If, as is generally suggested (Morgan et al. 1990), recovery of phosphorylated AChE in fish requires synthesis of new enzyme, rates of recovery would be slow and dependent on rates of metabolism and the physiological and biochemical characteristics of fishes, which appear to be unknown. In the absence of having a model for predicting recovery periods, empirical observations suggest that inter-exposure intervals of the order of 4â8 wk might be required for complete recovery of AChE in fish. This period was incorporated into the ERA (Sect. 4.2)."

376,463,0.286,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Concerns about the welfare of a rare bird, the California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), led to a study of the SES that sustains the small wetlands that are its primary habitat in the Sierra Nevada foothills. More than two-thirds of the wetlands in the area are fed primarily by irrigation water, either by irrigation runoff or through leaks in earthen irrigation canals and ditches, and are scattered within grazed annual grasslands that are mostly in private ownership. Wetlands fed by irrigation water are also more consistently wet and had greater bird use than those subject to seasonal water variations (Richmond et al. 2010). Designing the study and analyzing research results using an SES framework revealed that many wetlands are functionally âaccidentalâ and have little impact on land use or productivity from the landowner perspective. They are largely ignored by landowners, and while this benign neglect is to some degree why they have served as black rail habitat for decades, changing environmental and economic conditions could lead to their demise. In this study, the SES framework linked factors outside of the land manager-ecosystem relationship to strong impacts on the potential for conserving rail habitat, and revealed a need for governance that facilitates feedbacks from rail habitat conditions to water districts. The secretive black rail is a small ground-dwelling marsh bird, and was known only from large marshes in San Francisco Bay and along the lower Colorado River until it was âdiscoveredâ in the Sierra foothills of Yuba, Nevada, Placer, and Butte counties in 1994 (Richmond et al. 2008). The SES framework enabled researchers to conceptualize and model the ecosystem service of rail habitat provision as a product of the interaction of humans and environment, rather than a service provided by the ecosystem alone (Huntsinger and Oviedo 2014). Researchers hypothesized that the interaction of landowners and environment is driven mostly by water scarcity, fears of mosquito-related illness, ranching activities, water price, and landowner goals for their land (Fig. 8.3). To understand how landowner decisions influenced black rail habitat, landowners within the birdâs habitat distribution were surveyed about water and land management goals and practices in 2014. Results showed that about half the landowners purchased irrigation water from a water district. Water districts are local government institutions that supply water to farms and homes in a rural area. They typically serve hundreds to thousands of properties. While many respondents reported having a small wetland that could be rail habitat on their property, few survey respondents reported any management of such wetlands, with about 9 % reporting draining a wetland in the last 5 years, and 9 % reporting that they created a wetland during the last 5 years. About half said that they valued wetlands as wildlife habitat, about a quarter thought that the green forage was useful for livestock, but about a quarter reported not doing any management because the wetlands simply did not âbotherâ them."
241,1124,0.286,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"expanded sixfold soon after the collapse of cod stocks, during 1988â1995. A simultaneous decrease in zooplankton suggests that the effects of the cod collapse cascaded down from planktivores to zooplankton (Casini et al. 2008; Fig. 19.2). The marine zooplankton also declined because of direct physiological stress caused by declining salinity, and consequently, there was less food available for planktivores. This eventually caused starvation and low growth of clupeids, especially herring, in the late 1980s (Flinkman et al. 1998; RÃ¶nkkÃ¶nen et al. 2003; MÃ¶llmann et al. 2005) (Fig. 19.3). It is notable that the state of the cod stock in the Baltic Sea is not only driven by salinity and oxygen variation. This became clear when the eastern Baltic Sea cod stock started to recover in 2005, after more than two decades of low biomass and productivity, and despite the continuing âcod hostileâ (i.e. low oxygen) environment (Cardinale and SvedÃ¤ng 2011). The recovery was mainly driven by a sudden reduction in ï¬shing mortality and occurred in the absence of any exceptionally large year classes. This suggests that effects of ï¬sheries may at times override environmental factors as controllers of cod stocks in the Baltic Sea. The observation launched a vivid debate on the causes and consequences of the variations in the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea (MÃ¶llmann et al. 2011)."

Moreover, rates of exclusive breastfeeding of children 6 months of age or younger in Brazil (39 percent), continue to be almost 30 percentage points below those found in Peru (67 percent), and Chile (82 percent), although they are substantially higher than those in Mexico (14 percent). 14. For example, in Peru, in 2012, almost 1.2 million children received milk or other foodstuffs from the municipal Vaso de Leche program, and an even larger number received food from the Programa Nacional de Apoyo Alimentario (PRONAA). (In 2013, PRONAA was abolished and replaced by Qali Warma, a program that provides school meals to children in preschool and elementary school.) Jointly, these programs had a budget of 0.2 percent of GDP. In Uruguay, the Programa Alimentario Nacional has a budget equivalent to 0.12 percent of GDP. 15. Evidence from the region can be found in Cunha (2014) for Mexico; and in Hidrobo and others (2014) for Ecuador. 16. See discussions in Alive and Thrive (2014); Gilmore and McAuliffe (2013); Lassi and others (2013); and PÃ©rez-Escamilla and others (2012). 17. Half of the children in the intervention group, and half of those in the control group received a nutritional supplement, which consisted of one kilogram of formula per week. Although children who received the supplement initially outperformed those who did not, with effect sizes comparable to those found for the early stimulation intervention, the effects of the supplement were no longer apparent after late childhood. As a result, researchers have generally worked with two groups only: one in which half the children are a pure control group, and half received the nutritional supplement only (jointly referred to as the âcontrolâ group); and one in which half the children received the stimulation intervention only, and the other half received the stimulation and the nutritional supplement (jointly referred to as the âtreatmentâ group). This is the approach that was followed in the discussion in this chapter. 18. Half the children in both the treatment and control groups in Colombia received a nutritional intervention (in this case, micronutrient supplements), but this had no effect on child nutritional status or other measures of child development. 19. Relatively little is known about the FODI intervention itself (e.g., about the qualifications of the home visitors, the curriculum of the intervention, whether it was implemented with fidelity, or about the number of visits that each family received in practice), and the program has since been discontinued. The estimated effect sizes are surprisingly large, especially when compared to the Colombian intervention. It is important to corroborate these findings from evaluations of at-scale programs elsewhere in the region. 20.

231,841,0.285,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"resilience. Increases in species richness seem to have been due to the addition of warm-temperate species without the loss of cool-temperate species. The warm period since the late 1980s is still too short to determine whether the present ecosystem state is transitional and whether the cool-temperate species will gradually disappear, but evidence from archaeological material laid down during the Mesolithic warm period (4000â7500 y BP) indicates that cool-temperate species may remain (Enghoff et al. 2007) at least until temperatures rise by considerably more. The time taken for this to happen depends on the rate of global warming but also on decadal regional variability, which could maintain a cooler state over the next few decades. Substantial biological changes in the Northeast Atlantic including the North Sea have been associated with shifts in the sub-polar gyre and warming over recent decades (Hatun et al. 2009). This includes large-scale modiï¬cation of the phenology and distribution of plankton assemblages (Beaugrand et al. 2002; Edwards and Richardson 2004; Richardson and Schoeman 2004), changes in the availability of food resources and species, reproduction of benthic animals, composition of ï¬sh assemblages (Attrill and Power 2002; Simpson et al. 2011), and recruitment to the North Sea cod stock (Clark et al. 2003; Olsen et al. 2011). The diversity of the North Sea ecosystem may lead to contrasting responses to future climate change. For instance, the increase in temperature, light (through improved transparency), and wind in the south-eastern North Sea have probably contributed to the increase in algal biomass in this region during the period 1948â2004 (Llope et al. 2009). While their data suggest that phytoplankton biomass may have reached a maximum in the southernmost parts of the North Sea, Llope et al. (2009) concluded that phytoplankton biomass in the northern North Sea would continue to respond positively to a warmer, brighter, and windier future if current trends are maintained. Projections of the phenological responses of individual species under climate change have not yet been made, but the empirical evidence suggests that phenological changes will continue as climate warming continues. It is currently uncertain whether genetic adaptations within species populations will be able to cope with these changes, at least partly, or whether the pace of climate change is too fast for genetic adaptations to take place. This uncertainty is further compounded by the difference in phenological responses between species and functional groups. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching and result in disruption of the functioning, persistence and resilience of North Sea ecosystems. It is not clear whether general species attributes (e.g. trophic level) are sufï¬cient to predict future outcomes or"
224,101,0.285,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"In the opposite direction of causality, one finds natural resources (such as timber, or mining products) being extracted preferably in low density areas, which boosts the metabolic rates in these regions. High density areas are instead only the consumers of these resources, and the âupstream flowsâ do not weigh on their metabolic rates. This difference was considered so striking that UNEP based its scenarios of future resource use on the assumption that developing countries, over the coming decades, would tend to emulate the metabolic rates of industrial countries but maintain differences according to population density (UNEP 2011). Nevertheless, the IRP came to the conclusion that the already ongoing continuation of metabolic convergence would lead to an untenable level of global resource use, running up not only against all climate concerns but also against global resource constraints (fossil fuels, metals). Thus, Boserup, in contrast to most of her contemporaries, correctly viewed population growth and density increase not just as rising but also as alleviating environmental burdens."

241,923,0.285,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(Cramp and Simmons 1977; Pihl et al. 1995; Gilissen et al. 2002). A minor component of the Finnish and Swedish populations of some coastal birds remains in the northern Baltic Sea (Gilissen et al. 2002). Winter severity in the Baltic Sea reflects winter severity in the North Sea and further off the coast of western Europe, as well as in central Europe (Hurrell 1995). Winter severity in western Europe affects the non-breeding survival of several coastal birds and seabirds (Nilsson 1984; Koskinen et al. 2003). In addition to mortality from starvation and cold, severe winters may force birds to migrate further than normal and this incurs extra energy costs. Furthermore, when the Baltic Sea is largely ice-covered, seabirds are forced to feed in small open areas which increases competition for food and possibly the risk of disease (Grenquist 1965; Hario et al. 1995). Climate change affects the arrival and departure times of migrants (Forchhammer et al. 2002; JonzÃ©n et al. 2002; HÃ¼ppop and HÃ¼ppop 2003; Lehikoinen et al. 2004; Lehikoinen and Sparks 2010; Lehikoinen and Jaatinen 2011) and the timing of breeding (Forchhammer et al. 1998; Both and Visser 2001; MÃ¸ller 2002; Sanz 2002). A mismatch between hatching time and resource availability has been observed in passerines (e.g. pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Both et al. 2006) as well as in ducks (Oja and PÃ¶ysÃ¤ 2007). Trophic mismatches may cause population declines particularly in long-distance migrants in seasonal habitats (Both et al. 2010). In addition to trophic constraints, longdistance migrants may suffer from increasing competitive pressure by residents and short-distance migrants along with climate change, contributing to population declines in longdistance migrants (Lemoine and BÃ¶hning-Gaese 2003). Climate change may also drive changes in migratory routes, stopover sites and migratory tendencies within species and populations. For instance, delayed departure from breeding areas may be the cause of recently observed northward shifts in wintering ducks (Lehikoinen and Jaatinen 2011). Milder winters may allow birds to winter closer to breeding grounds and thus contribute to higher survival, which has been proposed for the mallard (Gunnarsson et al. 2012). However, temperature may be less important in shaping the wintering distributions of European dabbling ducks than factors such as feeding ecology (Dalby et al. 2013). Species ranges are expected to move poleward with climate change (Thomas and Lennon 1999; Hickling et al. 2006), and this has already been shown for the breeding ranges of central European and Arctic birds (Brommer et al. 2012). More study species (41; 69 %) shifted their range margin northwards than southwards (18; 31 %) (Î§2, p = 0.00275). Only a few range margin shifts were greater than three grid squares. An example of a species with a large shift in the southern border northward is the ruff Philomachus pugnax. Large shifts in the northern border occurred in coot, mute swan, common eider, razorbill and Arctic skua"

Australian bats have also been documented preferentially foraging around water sources. When compared to other habitat types in the Simpson Desert, more feedings buzzes were recorded around permanent and temporary water sources (Williams and Dickman 2004). Bats will also forage over hypersaline water bodies but more feeding buzzes are recorded over freshwater sites (Griffiths et al. 2014b). There is also evidence (e.g. Aldridge and Rautenbach 1987; Schoeman and Jacobs 2003, 2011; Naidoo et al. 2011, 2013) that insects associated with freshwater habitats (e.g. Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera) occur in the diet of southern African bats."

The Pawnee National Grassland is managed for multiple ecosystem goods and servicesâ domestic livestock grazing, wildlife, threatened and endangered plants and animals, recreational opportunities, and oil and gas development. These multiple goods and services interconnect the interests of public land managers with private land ranchers (Fig. 15.6). Drought can occur at any time in the region and multiyear droughts of 8â14 years occurred in the 1930s and the early 1950s (Lauenroth and Burke 2008; Evans et al. 2011). Facilitating ecosystem resilience and reducing risk of resource degradation are important to these grassland managers. Reducing economic risks when drought reduces forage availability from public and private land is important to the private land livestock owners. Drought often brings conflict between environmental and economic interests because it directly involves environmental and socioeconomic systems."

Deforestation will also contribute to the increase of GHG emission to the atmosphere. In the long term, the increasing GHG concentration in the atmosphere will cause an increase in global temperature and global climate. New finding from the 5th AR of IPCC indicated that agriculture, forest, and other land uses represent 20â24 % of global emission. Without mitigation efforts, the contribution of this sector may increase to 30 % by 2030. The three tropical regions, South America (TSAm), Southeast Asia (SEA), and tropical Africa (Af), are the main contributors to the global emission from land use change and forestry (Fig. 9.1). In the last 50 years, the rate of the emission from this sector tended to increase, except in South America (Houghton et al. 2012), and it is the largest and most variable single contributor to the emission from land use change (Le Quere et al. 2013). It is clear that deforestation in the short term will affect the regional climate and in the long term enhances global warming causing the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events. Among Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia has the largest forest area. Rate of deforestation fluctuates from year to year; however, in general it tended to increase. GHG emission from land use change and forest (LUCF) has been found to be the major contributor to the total national emission. It accounted for about 60 % of the total national emission, much higher than energy sector (MoE 2010). Efforts for reducing national emission have been prioritized on this sector (Bappenas 2010). Potential of reducing emission from REDD+ activities, i.e., reducing deforestation and forest degradation, maintaining role of forest conservation, implementing"

The adenohypophysis receives the majority of its blood supply from the paired superior hypophyseal arteries, which arise from the medial aspect of the internal carotid artery, within the ophthalmic segment. The neurohypophysis is supplied by the inferior hypophyseal arteries. These vessels are terminal branches of the meningohypophyseal trunk, which arises from the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. The hypophyseal portal veins drain the primary capillary plexus formed by the superior hypophyseal arteries, which deliver blood to the pars distalis. The pars distalis in turn houses the secondary capillary plexus. Thus, a portal venous system allows delivery of hypothalamic prohormones to the adenohypophysis, and the neurohypophysis secretes hormones directly into the venous draining system of the pituitary 76.

To identify and explore the barriers and bridges to that integration, a range of social and systems sciences were applied to examine the effectiveness of ârepublican,â e.g., national, based on the French system, and traditional forms of governance and the potential to harmonize them. In addition, exercises in scenario development allowed managers and planners to explore potential paths of policy development. Finally, conceptual modeling afforded a systems analysis of the ecological, economic, and social factors that can individually or by interaction create opportunities or barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries management. The results were used to make recommendations for ï¬sh and water policies, in education (universities and governmental agricultural professional schools), and will have practical relevance for food security and health care (Melcher et al. 2013; Ouedraogo et al. 2014; Sendzimir et al. 2015). This chapter pursues the central question of the SUSFISH project, e.g., what is the long-term potential to establish sustainable ï¬sheries and aquatic ecosystems on which they depend in BF? SUSFISH embraced this question as a challenge wider than simply transferring the technical means to monitor ï¬sheries but in instilling and awakening a culture of healthy ï¬sheries that is broadly supported across Burkinabe society as well as in government policy. We begin by describing the scientiï¬c advances that the project used in application to establish bioindicators and monitoring methods as the technical base of ï¬sheries management. We then consider the many factors, biophysical as well as economic, political, and cultural, which potentially can inï¬uence the trajectory of Burkinabe ï¬sheries toward sustainability. We conclude with recommendations based on lessons learned."

Much effort has gone into exploring geographic and taxonomic patterns of diversity, looking to answer why some regions and some taxa are more species-rich than others. Recent debate has contrasted explanations based upon ecological limits and times for speciation (e.g. see Rabosky and Lovette 2008). Comparisons between sister taxa, which are by deï¬nition of equal age, allow us to control for time for speciation, and thus differences in richness must reï¬ect either variation in speciation or extinction rates (Barraclough et al. 1998). Such comparisons have shown that diversiï¬cation rates have been higher in more tropical lineages (Davies et al. 2004; Rolland et al. 2014), but that higher tropical species richness is most likely a product of both faster rates and longer times for speciation (Jansson and Davies 2008). However, high diversiï¬cation might be explained by high speciation rates, low extinction rates or a combination of both, and until recently, it has not been possible to reliably disentangle the two. Unraveling the processes of extinction and speciation remains a major challenge (Benton and Emerson 2007). The fossil record is often thought to provide the most reliable documentation of speciation and extinction, yet the cumulative fossil record suggests that speciation rate increases inexorably through time (Raup 1991; Nee 2006; Benton and Emerson 2007), whereas there is growing evidence suggesting that species accumulate in bursts, and speciation rates decline over time (Simpson 1953; Schluter 2000; Gavrilets and Vose 2005; Scantlebury 2013). Phylogeny provides an alternative tool for reconstructing evolutionary process (Harvey et al."

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are still widespread but concentrations are decreasing. Levels of lindane and DDT are also decreasing, but occasional erosion of old deposits leads to fluctuating concentrations in the Wadden Sea. Of particular future concern (as possible hormone disruptors) are newly developed xenobiotics, which include flame retardants, perfluorinated sulfonates and phthalates.

Furthermore, physical processes and ecological characteristics along the northwestern Cuban shoreline are similar to those of the Florida Keys. The Caribbean coast of Mexico is the northern portion of the Caribbean Sea Ecoregion, named the Contoyan Neritic sub-region (Wilkinson et al. 2009). The sub-region name reflects proximity to Isla Contoy, located just east of the Campeche/YucataÌn Inner Neritic zone (Figure 6.3). The area generally has lower average sea surface temperatures (28  C [82  F] in summer and 22.5  C [72.5  F] in winter; Figure 6.4) and lower nutrient loading than the Southern GoM Marine Ecoregion. Coral reefs, carbonate beaches, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows are common coastal habitats, and water flow through the YucataÌn Channel has a primary influence on coastal and shelf ecosystems. Beaches are primary tourist attractions of economic importance to the region. The Northern GoM Ecoregion is a warm-temperate area in the GoM basin that contains approximately 60 % of tidal marshes in the United States, freshwater inputs from 37 major rivers, and numerous nursery habitats for fish (Figure 6.2) (Wilkinson et al. 2009). Average sea-surface summer temperatures in this region range from 28 to 30  C (82 to 86  F), while winter temperatures range from 14 to 24  C (57 to 75  F) (Figure 6.4). This is generally a region of high nutrient loading and includes biotic communities such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, coastal lagoons and estuaries, and low river basins. This ecoregion extends from southern Keewaydin Island on the west coast of Florida to just south of Barra del Tordo in the State of Tamaulipas, Mexico and comprises six subregions that reflect the influence of tropical currents from the Caribbean Sea through the YucataÌn Channel, the Loop Current and associated warm-water eddies, freshwater contributions from major river systems and groundwater, and outflows through the Straits of Florida. Level III subregions include the Western Florida Estuarine, Eastern Gulf Neritic, Mississippi Estuarine, Texas Estuarine, Laguna Madre Estuarine, and the Western Gulf Neritic (Figure 6.3). The Southern GoM Ecoregion encompasses tropical waters of Mexico that support a variety of coastal habitats, including coastal lagoons, estuaries, beaches and dunes, mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. Air temperatures vary little between winter and summer, averaging about 26  C (79  F), although sea surface temperatures vary between 24 and 28.5  C (75 and 83  F), respectively (Figure 6.4). This is also a region of generally high nutrient loading and some local upwelling. The continental margin in this region is very topographically diverse, including a relatively narrow continental shelf (6 to 16 km [3.8 to 10 mi] wide) in the southwestern portion of the ecoregion with beaches and estuaries composed primarily of reworked fluvial sediment, interspersed with coastal rocky outcrops (Moreno-Casasola 2007; Contreras-Espinosa and CastanÌeda-Lopez 2007). In contrast, the southeastern coast of Campeche and YucataÌn is fronted by a wide and shallow carbonate continental shelf and carbonate sand beaches. Many of the same biotic communities present in the northern GoM are common in this ecoregion, although coastal salt marshes are almost completely replaced by mangroves, and coral reefs and seagrasses become important. The Southern Gulf ecoregion extends from Barra del Tordo, along all six Gulf-facing States in Mexico, to the northeastern end of the YucataÌn Peninsula. Subregions include Veracruz Neritic, Tabasco Neritic, Campeche/YucataÌn Inner Neritic, and Campeche/YucataÌn Outer Neritic (Figure 6.3). Marine ecoregions for Cuba were not classified beyond Level I (Greater Antilles; Spalding et al. 2007); however, coastal systems within the Central Caribbean Ecoregion described by Sullivan-Sealey and Bustamante (1999) (equivalent to the Greater Antilles Ecoregion of Spalding et al. 2007) were classified based on dominant community type. Coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove-dominated habitat are common along the northwestern Cuba coast. Further discussion of this classification is presented below in Section 6.4.2."
337,6,0.284,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"In other words, sustainability need not even be an issue because human ingenuity will guarantee that any problems associated with resource depletion will be addressed through market mechanisms. NEP, the New Environmental Paradigm and alternative framework (Dunlap and Van Liere 1978; Dunlap et al. 2000), placed human society into a larger gestalt that viewed it as a part of the natural order. A NEP perspective suggested: (1) there were real and finite limits to what technology could do; (2) there was a need to accept the limits on human affairs imposed by the biophysical environment through physical and biological constraints; and (3) human survival was dependent upon the health of the environment. Much of the current sustainable development literature directs attention to the unresolved tensions between environmental protection and economic development regularly treating these issues as separate policy concerns. Analyses of the environmental protection movement emphasized changes in social values that occurred more or less explicitly in response to this tension (cf., Humphrey and Buttel 1982; Schnaiberg 1980; Buttel 1992). Hays (1991), for example, in his discussion of the post-World War II history of forest planning and management, noted a shift in public attitudes from one that viewed forestlands primarily as a source of useful products (such as wood and wood products) towards one that viewed the forest as a setting for home, work, and play. More generally, Field and Burch (1988) noted a shift from control and exploitation of nature as dominant themes to the emergence of a view that partners nature and society. The selection of any option based on an OR scenario is problematic since no choice is made with impunity. All choices have costs. Moreover, whereas we might"

The use of jetties as a way to increase the flow in the main channel and hence increase bottom scour is a way to reduce the amount of dredging that may be needed, but any modiï¬cation of the width and depth of a river channel can impact its flood carrying capacity. It can also alter the periodic flooding of the floodplain that in turn can have ecological impacts. 1.3.6.2 River Bank Erosion Bank erosion can be a serious problem where towns are located close to morphologically active (eroding) rivers. Predictions of changes in river courses due to bank erosion and bank accretion are important inputs to land use planning in river valleys and the choice of locations for bridges, buildings, and hydraulic structures. 1.3.6.3 Reservoir Related Issues Degradation of the riverbeds upstream of reservoirs may increase the risks of flooding in those areas. Reservoir construction inevitably results in loss of land and forces the evacuation of residents due to impoundment. Reservoirs can be ecological barriers for migrating ï¬sh species such as salmon. The water quality in the reservoir may deteriorate and the inflowing sediment may settle and accumulate, reducing the active (useful) water storage capacity of the reservoir and causing more erosion downstream. Other potential problems may include those stemming from stratiï¬cation, water-related diseases, algae growth, and abrasion of hydropower turbines.

For example, extinction will tend to remove largebodied species with slow life histories and narrow niches, and species in regions with high intensity of extinction drivers. Because many of the traits linked to extinction risk (e.g. body size, generation time, dispersal ability etc.) demonstrate phylogenetic conservatism (Fritz and Purvis 2010), such that they tend to be clustered on the phylogeny, extinctions will also tend to cluster on the phylogeny. Whereas evidence for trait-based explanations for plant extinctions is mixed (Freville et al. 2007; Bradshaw et al. 2008; Sodhi et al. 2008; Davies et al. 2011; Daru et al. 2013),"

182,357,0.284,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"ANIMALS AS PATHOLOGICAL SPECIMENS The role of pathological specimen was performed after death by many of the animals that feature in this volume. Its frequency reveals how important animal bodies were to the building of pathological knowledgeâ about diseases that afflicted particular animals, the distribution of diseases across the species, and the disease relationships between species. We have seen how animals were transformed into pathological specimens through post-mortem examination. Their organs, tissues and bodily fluids could be observed directly, removed for exhibition to interested parties, preserved for deposition and inspection within museums, or prepared for microscopic examination within laboratories. In existing historical literature, these processes and practices are generally sidelined by, or conflated with, the animalâs role as experimental material. The key exception is in accounts of the state control of certain late nineteenth-century animal diseases. Woods shows that in Britain, policies for the eradication of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and swine fever were predicated on the belief that they could be diagnosed accurately during post-mortem examination. Experience demonstrated that this was not, in fact, the case: Abigail Woods. âfrom Practical Men to Scientific Experts: British Veterinary Surgeons and the Development of Government Scientific Expertise, c.1878â1919.â History of Science li (2013): 457â80. Other authors have explored the diagnosis, in animal pathological specimens, of diseases that spread to humans via meat consumption. Here the animals performed simultaneously as food, a role that is discussed further below. Starting in Germany, and spreading subsequently to other European countries and the USA, specimens of pig muscle were subjected to microscopic inspection to see if they contained the parasitic disease trichinosis, which could cause death to human consumers: J.

233,92,0.284,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"with a concentration of threatened phylogenetic distinctive and rare species. Here, the PE measure was combined with probabilities of extinction. Their âimperilled phylogenetic endemismâ (IPE) index is the sum over all branches of branch length times its probability of extinction (product of extinction probabilities of all descendents) times the inverse of its range-extent. Gudde et al. (2013) claimed to âquantify where on the landscape at-risk evolutionary history is concentrated.â However, their âimperilled phylogenetic endemismâ (IPE) index appears to have the weakness that it could highlight places that have no threatened branches at all. As a revealing example, suppose that area A has 20 species, all of IUCN âleast concernâ (see IUCN 2006, 2012). Suppose that this corresponds to a low probability of extinction of 0.025 (for methods and discussion, see Mooers et al. 2008; Faith and Richards 2012). Each species is found in only ten areas. Suppose that area B has ï¬ve species, all IUCN âcritically endangeredâ (probability of extinction assumed to be a higher 0.4). Each species is found in 50 areas, but all are found together in this one area. Suppose also that each species is at the end of a branch of some unit length. Also, for simplicity, I will ignore deeper branches (assuming that all species have numerous secure sisters). IPE in this simple case is equal to the product of the number of branches, the probability of extinction and the inverse of the number of cells containing a given branch. Application of IPE gives area A the higher priority; the IPE score equals 20 times 0.025 times 1/10 or 0.05. IPE gives area B the lower priority; the IPE score equals 5 times 0.4 times 1/50 or 0.04. Application of IPE therefore would ignore the opportunity to save, with a reserve based around area B, ï¬ve critically endangered species. Instead, IPE would give preference to an area with 20 non-threatened species! This reveals the key limitation of the approach. IPE is supposed to reï¬ect a concentration of range restricted, threatened species. Gudde et al. (2013) argued that âour mapping does indeed quantify where at risk PD is concentratedâ. However, IPE, in the example above, actually quantiï¬ed where not-at-risk PD was concentrated! This weakness of IPE is similar to that of EDGE (see above and Faith 2008). Both methods suffer the weakness that phylogenetic overlap of species is not effectively taken into account. For EDGE type assessments, an existing probabilistic PD approach (Witting and Loeschcke 1995) performs better (Faith 2008; see also May-Collado and Agnarsson 2011; Kuntner et al. 2011). In the ï¬nal section, I examine the prospects for using this âexpected PDâ approach to address some conservation assessment problems that have been unsuccessfully treated by the ED type methods. The PE measure is relevant to another study that attempts to integrate range extent and threat information into PD assessments. In their global study on conservation of phylogenetic diversity of birds, Jetz et al. (2014) devised a measure related to ED to provide scores for regions or areas. Their âEDRâ score for a species is simply the ED value divided by the range (number of occupied cells) of the species. Total EDR for a given region then is the summed EDR of all species occurring in the region. Jetz et al. ask, âUnder an objective of minimizing global PD loss, how do ED and EDR perform as metrics for a rule-based approach to taxon- and"

After damming, annual maximum peak discharges have decreased, minimum discharges increased, but average discharges remained similar to pre-damming conditions (Fig. 6.5). Moreover, because of riverbed incision of over 1.5 m, a higher discharge is needed to reach bank-full level and to inundate ï¬oodplains, which is the largest ï¬oodplain in Europe (length 300 km, width 20 km). Commercial ï¬sh catches severely decreased after damming, both in the main channel and in the ï¬oodplain lakes (Fig. 6.6). If the continuity of sediment transport is interrupted by dams or removal of sediment from the channel by gravel mining, the ï¬ow may become sediment starved (hungry water) and prone to erode the channel bed and banks, producing channel incision (downcutting), coarsening of bed material, and loss of habitat for litophilic species (Kondolf 1997; Fig. 6.7). Riverbed incision reduces the connectivity to ï¬oodplain habitats. Together with reduced ï¬ood ï¬ows (e.g., due to storage) the dimension and quality of ï¬oodplain habitats is reduced, affecting the productivity of the entire river-ï¬oodplain system. Also, further downstream, lack of sediment may cause habitat degradation due to erosion of river deltas or coastal shores."

36,97,0.283,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Abstract Land-use change is a key driver of the global biodiversity crisis and a particularly serious threat to tropical biodiversity. Throughout the tropics, the staggering pace of deforestation, logging, and conversion of forested habitat to other land uses has created highly fragmented landscapes that are increasingly dominated by human-modified habitats and degraded forests. In this chapter, we review the responses of tropical bats to a range of land-use change scenarios, focusing on the effects of habitat fragmentation, logging, and conversion of tropical forest to various forms of agricultural production. Recent landscape-scale studies have considerably advanced our understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat fragmentation and disturbance at the population, ensemble, and assemblage level. This research emphasizes that responses of bats are often species and ensemble specific, sensitive to spatial scale, and strongly molded by the characteristics of the prevailing landscape matrix. Nonetheless, substantial knowledge gaps exist concerning other types of response by bats. Few studies have assessed responses at the genetic, behavioral, or physiological level, with regard to disease prevalence, or"

291,114,0.283,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The panel on the left denotes the probability to survive for another 5 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer, regardless of the actual cause of death. The figure exhibits an obvious age gradient: Values of 30% or less at ages above 90 are the consequence that the women are not only at an elevated risk of dying from breast cancer. Other causes, most notably circulatory diseases, further reduce the chances to survive for five more years. Consequently, the upward trend of the contour lines can not be interpreted as progress made against the lethality of breast cancer. Still it provides the answer to the question âHow likely is it that I survive for another five years?â for someone who got diagnosed with breast cancer. While the left panel takes all âexitâ possibilities into account, the panel in the middle looks only at death from breast cancer. As a consequence, one minus the depicted value equals the probability to die from breast cancer within 5 years after diagnosis. The rather vertical lines from about age 40 to about age 80 indicate that the chance of surviving breast cancer for at least 5 years has increased over time. For instance, the probability for 60-year-old women who got diagnosed with breast cancer in 1980 to survive 5 years was 80%; the equivalent value in 2000 was higher than 90%. To express it even more positively: The risk of dying was cut in half within less than 20 years (1980: 1 0:8 D 20%; 1995 W 1 0:9 D 10%)! The panel on the right of Fig. 10.3 shows ârelative survivalâ, i.e., it illustrates the relative survival disadvantage of those diagnosed with breast cancer in relation to the general population. A level of one would indicate that there was no difference in the chance to survive for five more years between someone with a cancer diagnosis and the general population. Unfortunatelyâbut also not surprisinglyâwomen with breast cancer have lower survival chances than the general population. We can detect, however, progress over time. The excess risk is less than 10% in recent years for women with breast cancer in comparison to the general population (contour line of 0.9) whereas it was about 30% just 25 years earlier. It is important to point out that the increasing values of the vertical lines suggest a clear period effect: Progress against breast cancer was faster than progress in survival in general, regardless of the age when the woman was diagnosed. It is theoretically possible to observe relative survival estimates that are higher than one. For instance, it could be the outcome of a selection effect: Persons that take advantage of screening programs and other early preventive measures are possibly leading rather healthy lifestyles. If those persons are diagnosed with a cancer that is virtually non-lethal, their survival advantage of their health behavior might be stronger than the additional mortality risk of the malignant neoplasm. Hence, it can not be concluded that getting diagnosed with a certain cancer could actually improve survival chances. We would argue, though, that the small area at ages 90â 95 in 2000 is not the outcome of such a selection effect. Instead, we assume that it is the outcome of random data fluctuations due to small numbers of persons getting diagnosed. For example, 46 women at age 93 were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000. The corresponding estimates for colorectal cancer are depicted in Figs. 10.4 and 10.5 for women and men, respectively (pages 129 & 130). Both sexes feature comparable estimates.

Clearly, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat modification. To advance ecological understanding, we have highlighted a number of more specific research needs across all themes in this chapter. We further stress the following key research directions as particularly worthy of pursuit, many of which have been summarized in different context for mammals in general (e.g., Willig 2001). 1. Geographic and taxonomic biases toward the Neotropics and a focus on just one bat family, Phyllostomidae, need to be overcome. Although research efforts in Southeast Asia are gaining momentum (Kingston 2013), Africa deserves greatly intensified research activities. As technological advances now make acoustic sampling of aerial insectivorous bats increasingly time- and costefficient, this ensemble should regularly be targeted in ecological research, including environmental impact assessments. 2. Research should be broadened to encompass the full spectrum of possible responses at the level of populations, ensembles, assemblages, and metacommunities. Novel mechanistic insights could be gained by studies that assess behavioral responses to particular types of habitat conversion or habitat fragmentation. Similarly, studies are needed to investigate physiological and immune responses, as well as disease susceptibility across a broad range of host and vector species. A better understanding of the genetic effects on bats from habitat modification requires integrated research on a suite of different species that explore the link between patterns of genetic variation and speciesâ ecological and life-history traits. In general, the way in which species traits and"

Historical and physical paleoflood data provide another example of censored data. Before the beginning of a continuous measurement program on a stream or river, the stages of unusually large floods can be estimated based on the memories of humans who have experienced these events and/or physical markings in the watershed (Stedinger and Baker 1987). Before continuous measurements were taken that provided this information, the annual maximum floods that were not unusual were not recorded. These missing data are censored data. They cover periods between occasionally large floods that have been recorded or that have left some evidence of their occurrence (Stedinger and Cohn 1986). The discussion below addresses probability plot methods for use with censored data. Probability plot methods have a long history of use with censored data because they are relatively simple to use and to understand. Moreover, recent research has shown that they are relatively efï¬cient when the majority of values are observed, and unobserved values are known only to be below (or above) some detection limit or perception threshold that serves as a lower (or upper) bound. In such cases, probability plot regression estimators of moments and quantiles are as accurate as maximum likelihood estimators. They are almost as good as estimators computed with complete samples (Helsel and Cohn 1988; Kroll and Stedinger 1996). Perhaps the simplest method for dealing with censored data is adoption of a conditional probability model. Such models implicitly assume that the data are drawn from one of two classes of observations: those below a single threshold, and those above the threshold. This model is appropriate for simple cases where censoring occurs because small observations are recorded as âzero,â as often happens with low-flow, low pollutant concentration, and some flood records. The conditional probability model introduces an extra parameter P0 to describe the probability that an observation is âzero.â If r of a total of"

In another good example that occurred in the Gulf of Aden, three pirate skiffs made two attempts to approach the vessel.26 The first approach was deterred through the use of nonviolent evasion measures, whereas during the second approach it was necessary to utilize indirect force (first, a so-called parachute flareâon three separate occasions, followed by the second measure in the form of indirect warning shots) in order to persuade the skiffs to move away. Such examples represent a model scenario on how force is to be used, under what circumstances, and up to what extent of severity. The actor may, however, be held liable (for damage) if the defensive measures are unreasonably excessive or disproportional to the actual threat (excessive selfdefense) or if there was no actual threat (putative self-defense), as examined in further text."

Coastal habitats are already one of the most severely endangered habitats due to intensive land-use changes occurring during the last decades. Most changes are driven by tourism, which has caused substantial destruction of most endangered habitats such as coastal dunes. The second threat is increasing area of ports, which require more and more space for containers or car terminals. Urbanisation in general has caused an important pressure to coastal areas, which offer higher living standards, better economic conditions, job and education possibilities and favourable climate. Therefore, immigration pressure to coastal areas is substantial. Besides that, there is also agriculture, developed in adjacent areas to the coast, driven by favourable climate and increased requirement of fresh products. The constantly increasing anthropogenic pressure is additionally intensified by climate change effects, among which the sea level rise is a serious threat. Sea level rise is a parameter which â in contrast to many other climatic parameters, being also congruent among â is showing quite clear trends. However, factors which cause changes in morphology of coasts are numerous and include sediment supply, tidal currents, wave action, extreme weather events (Cooper and Pilkey 2004), and also the subsidence of the surface (Lambeck et al. 2004). Baustian et al. (2012) reports that in certain situation, such as high sedimentation of both organic and inorganic materials coastal wetlands may be able to keep pace with rising sea level. There are different projections of the sea level rise in different coastal areas across the globe; thus the only relevant basis for reliable predictions are local measurements on the concrete studied sites.

Annual outbreaks on trout farms may be due to persistence of the virus in the local environment or reinfection from wild redfin perch. Natural epizootics in redfin perch occur most often in summer, and there is evidence of a positive relationship between EHNV pathogenicity and water temperature. Redfin perch are not susceptible to EHNV below 10 Â°C, and incubation periods for the virus are shorter at higher temperatures (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995). In rainbow trout, EHNV outbreaks have occurred between 11 and 20 Â°C (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995; Whittington et al. 1994, 1999). Temperature-dependent pathogenicity may be related to viral replication rates (Ariel et al. 2009). The first transmission studies with EHNV were conducted by Langdon (1989) who identified a wide range of susceptible hosts, a factor that contributed to the listing of EHNV by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). Although there are recognized deficiencies in laboratory challenge models to determine the susceptibility of host fish to virus isolates under natural conditions, a potential increase in the host range of EHNV infections has been predicted. In three separate challenge studies, black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), pike (Esox Lucius), and pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) experienced significant mortality following bath exposure to EHNV (Bang-Jensen et al. 2009, 2011a; Gobbo et al. 2010). On the other hand, goldfish (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and European sheatfish (Silurus glanis) did not experience significant mortality following bath exposure to EHNV (Bang-Jensen et al. 2011b; Leimbach et al. 2014). Like other ranaviruses, the outcome of EHNV infection may depend on various viral, host, and environmental factors including: virus concentration and route of delivery, viral strain, host genetics, host density and age, and water temperature (Brunner et al. 2015). For example, lower mortality was observed when European redfin perch stocks were challenged with EHNV, but it was these individuals that caused transmission of the pathogen to and extensive mortality in Australian redfin perch that were cohoused with them (Ariel and Bang-Jensen 2009)."

(continued) countries to finance adequate benefits for future retirees for relatively low interest rates. Nevertheless, pensions might still need to be lower than currently promised benefits in some countries and/or parameters might need to be changed. These exercises may overestimate the benefits of funding as they may not take into account the indirect impact of declining real returns on savings as the population ages. In simulations by Attanasio et al. (2015), the worldâs interest rate declines from 4 percent in 2010 to 1.5 percent by 2100. If this were the case, increasing funding would provide less benefit. On the flip side, if savings are well invested and thus generate higher productivity growth, then the benefits of funding pensions would be higher. 3. Some countries will benefit more from funding than others. In relation to present time affordability, Panel b shows that for some countries with relatively young populations, including Belize and Guatemala, affordable replacement rates under fully funded arrangements are lower than under unfunded PAYG/DB. For other countriesâfor example, the Bahamas, Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, and venezuelaâfunding helps to increase affordability, but by less than 20 percent vis-Ã -vis the affordability of the unfunded PAYG/DB. Finally, for countries with a more advanced demographic transition, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, the benefits of funding in terms of increasing affordability are very large vis-Ã -vis the PAYG/DB systems. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that funding implies important transition costs, given that rights to retired workers must be preserved."

Fruit growers could thus be said to have revegetated the land, and therefore, it is unfair that they alone should bear the cost of protecting flying foxes.

Hence, Esselink and Chang (2010) concluded that storm floods contribute strongly to accretion of sediment, but that a hurricane flood does not always result in extra accretion, and may even result in less SEC at the low marsh. A thick layer of very turbulent water during a hurricane flood might prevent settlement conditions for sediment. Vegetation plays an important role in the accretion of sediment. This was demonstrated in the estuarine Dollard salt marshes in the Netherlands. Both vegetation density and height positively affected accretion rates (Esselink et al. 1998)."

28,219,0.283,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"At the start of the 1970s, the number of people recorded as âself-poisoning as communicationâ is still rising. Typical is a 1972 report from Dunfermline that claims acute âpoisoning has reached epidemic proportions ... [t]he number of poisoned patients increases year by year and there is no evidence that the trend is alteringâ.1 In the same year, a bleak study issues from Sheffield, entitled âSelf-Poisoning with Drugs: A Worsening Situationâ. This study claims that the rate of self-poisoning in Sheffield has doubled in the last decade and now accounts for almost one in ten medical admissions and one in five emergencies. Studies from Edinburgh, Oxford and Cardiff are cited as nationwide support for these truly alarming statistics.2 By the late 1970s however, it is reported from the Edinburgh RPTC that rates of self-poisoning are falling for men and levelling off for women. Keith Hawton and colleagues in Oxford report five years later that overall âthe recent epidemic of deliberate self-poisoning may have reached a peakâ around 1973.3 Work on this phenomenon of self-poisoning, parasuicide or overdosing continues throughout the decade; clinicians marvel at the seemingly endless increase, and then wonder at the abrupt levelling-off. There are three major research centres for these studies: in Edinburgh, at the MRC Unit and Ward 3 of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh; in Bristol, at the Accident Emergency Department of the Bristol Royal Infirmary; and in Oxford at the John Radcliffe (General) Hospital. These endeavours are increasingly led by Norman Kreitman (Edinburgh), Hugh Gethin Morgan (Bristol) and Keith Hawton (Oxford). Another form of self-harm emerges in the 1960s and 1970s in British psychiatry. Self-injury, self-mutilation or self-laceration are labels identifying people who damage themselves principally by cutting the skin on their forearms and/or wrists. This kind of self-harming behaviour"

126,340,0.282,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Some of the ï¬gures obtained were markedly below certain non-governmental organization estimatesâeven radically so, as in the case of Kalokol town, which was recorded by several nonproï¬t groups as 55,000 whereas the SONT estimate (from consultations with local elders and aid agency ï¬gures) was closer to 30,000. Since the population of Kalokol fluctuates greatly with economic and environmental conditions, this is not surprising. Other estimates, such as those by Oxfam for a number of village/town locales along the lakeârecorded in 2007 (prior to the 2007â2010 drought) , were lower. The highest population ï¬gures, however, provide the best indication of the central and northern Turkanaâs vulnerability to the decline or disappearance of Lake Turkanaâs waters and living resources. Local Turkana administrators and council of elders members consistently described to SONT researchers that the GOKâs 2009 census takers: â¢ Recorded populations only in major centers, avoiding the more populous outskirts. â¢ Avoided rural areas near the lake where most Turkana live (all local administrators questioned by SONT attest to the fact that there are often more people living between main village complexes than within them). The GOK Census states that census takers recorded very large areas (often hundreds of square kilometers around towns). Local ofï¬cials questioned gave contrary accountsânamely, that GOK census takers did not record the large and diffuse populations in lands surrounding those towns visited. â¢ Did not request the direct cooperation of locally chosen administratorsâindividuals who are trusted by local residents and far more knowledgeable about their communities and population sizes. â¢ Recorded information from children and others unlikely to report accurately, rather than from heads of household. Population estimates from SONT efforts with community members were taken primarily during the dry season. As noted earlier, the populations of these complexes can fluctuate widely with changing environmental and social conditions. Even a conservative estimate of the population dependent on the lakeâs resources points to at least 300,000 Turkana who are dependent on the lakeâs watersâfor household membersâ daily consumption, for ï¬shing and/or for livestock watering and grazing, and many exchange relations involving lake resources. â¢ The Turkana population surrounding Fergusonâs Gulf is particularly vulnerable to major hunger and disease conditions brought about by the retreat of Gulf waters, accompanied by ï¬shery collapse. Together with council of elders members, SONT conducted a preliminary survey of villages around the Gulf, and continued data collection at Kalokol and northward along the western shoreline. This work consistently produced larger ï¬gures than those released by the 2009 GOK census. Moreover, this population is overwhelmingly likely to swell as environmental and economic ârefugeesâ move southward along the lake and toward the lake from the upland plains. Fergusonâs Gulf, along with the northern reaches of the lake, must be anticipated to suffer the most immediate effects of early lake level drop from the developments underway (see Fig. 9.11). â¢ Lake retreat caused by the Gibe III damâs inevitable radical reduction of Omo River inflow, even during the presumed reservoir-ï¬ll, would desiccate Fergusonâs Gulf as indicated in the bathymetric of Figs. 9.10 and 9.11.11 â¢ The extremely shallow waters and biochemical characteristics of Fergusonâs Gulf support major reproductive habitats for ï¬sh species critical to the Turkana and intensive ï¬shing activity during parts of the year. These critical ï¬sh habitats would be eliminated by even the ï¬rst phase of lake retreat (Figs. 5.2 and 9.11). As this book goes into print, there is substantial evidence of major river flow reduction from closure of the Gibe III dam and reservoir ï¬lling, and early reports from villagers in both the lowermost Omo at Lake Turkana suggest both that recession agriculture in the delta and riverside environments and the riverâs annual pulse of freshwater, sediment and nutrients into the lake are fully compromised. All communities contacted report ï¬sh catches reduced, although to date, no systematic"

Figures 8.19 and 8.20 reveal the trends in brown shrimp in the northern Gulf of Mexico by state and total catch from 1980 and 1983 to 2009, respectively, showing fishery-dependent and fishery-independent catches. Figure 8.19 clearly demonstrates the predominance of the catch off Texas and Louisiana. Brown shrimp usually have the largest landings of northern Gulf shrimp (Figure 8.21). Brown shrimp reached an apex in 1990 at 103.4 million pounds (tails) followed by a low of 66.3 million pounds in 1997, a high of 96.8 million pounds in 2000, a low of 58.0 million pounds in 2005, and another high of 76.9 million pounds in 2009. The long-term average is 73.0 million pounds (Nance 2011). Fishing effort (measured in thousands of 24-h days fished) for brown shrimp increased steadily from 1960 through 1989 but then dropped off in 1991 and remained almost level for about 7 years (Figure 8.22). Effort then fluctuated over the next several years, reaching 100 thousand days fished in 2004, which is similar to days fished in the 1970s. Effort then dropped to the upper 60 thousand days fished for 2005 to 2007 and further dropped to 61 thousand days in 2008, the lowest since the 1960s. In 2009, brown shrimp effort increased to 82 thousand days fished (Nance 2011)."

233,561,0.282,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Introduction The Neotropical region extends from Mexico to northern Argentina, including the Amazon basin, the Andean cordillera and the Atlantic Forest. It is the most biologically diverse of the worldâs major biogeographic regions (Gaston and Hudson 1994; Myers et al. 2000; Hawkins et al. 2007). At least one million species of insects, 40,000 of plants, 3000 of ï¬shes, 1294 of birds, 427 of mammals, 427 of amphibians, and 378 of reptiles inhabit the Amazonian basin (Da Silva et al. 2005a). It is also a region of high endemism, including 6 of the worldâs 25 biodiversity âhotspotsâ (Myers et al. 2000). Many areas of the Neotropics are under continual threat from deforestation. In 2004, ca. 2.7 million ha of forest were cleared in Amazonia alone (INPE). In Central America, only 1.7 % of the original dry forest remains, and most of this comprises small, isolated patches (Griscom and Ashton 2011). Similarly, the Atlantic forest has been reduced to 12 % of its original area, with astonishing rates of deforestation every year (SOS Mata AtlÃ¢ntica, INPE, ISA 1998; Ribeiro et al. 2009). In Amazonia, wood extraction, industrial logging, cattle pastures, banana plantations and more recently oil palm culture are the main causes of the ongoing deforestation. The Neotropics are also threatened by climatic changes, which are likely to be particularly serious in mountain habitats (e.g., Engler et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2011; Feeley et al. 2011). Habitat destruction and climatic changes may cause species extirpation, displacements and extinction (e.g., Loiselle et al. 2010), which may in turn result in community disassembly, with loss of interspeciï¬c interactions (Sheldon et al. 2011). The consequences of community disassembly can be particularly strong in highly coevolved mutualistic species assemblages, such as insect-pollinator networks, plant species engaged in facilitation, or MÃ¼llerian mimetic species (Chazot et al. 2014). To preserve Neotropical biodiversity, given constraints of time and money, it is essential to identify priority areas for conservation (Williams et al. 1996). However, there are several problems in identifying such areas. Firstly, distribution data are not available for all taxa, so attention has focused on indicator taxa, which are expected to reliably indicate patterns of diversity in other, more poorly known groups (e.g., Howard et al. 1998; Lamoreux et al. 2006). Insects constitute at least 70 % of all terrestrial organisms (Samways 1994), and their outstanding evolutionary success"
102,226,0.282,Saving For Development : How Latin America and The Caribbean Can Save More and Better,"old is especially striking, from a very small portion 50 years ago to a significant percentage in the future. At the same time, fertility has fallen from 5.9 births per 1,000 women in 1950â55 to 2.15 in 2010â15, and is projected to decline even further to 1.78 in 2045â50. Around 2050, life expectancy and fertility rates in Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to converge to the levels of more advanced countries (United Nations, 2015). Not only will the number of older people be greater, but so too will the portion of the very old with higher needs. While less than 2 percent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean is older than 85, by the end of the century, that share will increase to more than 8 percent. The need for care of the elderly over the age of 85 increases significantly, despite technological advances. The share of adults that need help with functional activities of daily life (FADL) or instrumental activities of daily life (IADL)4 increases between two to five times after the age of 80, surveys conducted in Latin American cities in 2002 indicate (Table 6.1). Other sources suggest the same pattern. For instance, a survey conducted in Chile in 2009 showed that 12.8 percent of the elderly aged 60â64 were dependent in some way, while this percentage increased to more than 65 percent at ages 85 or over (SENAMA, 2009). This situation is similar in more advanced countries with better health systems. In countries like Italy, Germany, and Spain, the increase in the case of FADL is from nearly 10 percent at ages 60â64 to more than 30 percent for those over 75 years old. In the case of IADL, dependence at older ages is three times higher than for those between 65 and"

36,450,0.282,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"11.4 Offshore Wind Facilities Potential impacts of offshore wind-energy development on bats are poorly understood, although observations in Europe and anecdotal accounts of bats occurring offshore suggest that impacts may occur. Bats are known to regularly migrate across the Baltic and North Seas and visit offshore facilities (Hutterer et al. 2005; Boshamer and Bekker 2008; AhlÃ©n et al. 2009; Poerink et al. 2013; Rydell et al. 2014). AhlÃ©n et al. (2009) recorded 11 species of bats flying and feeding over the sea up to 14 km from the shore. In spring and late summer, migrating bats are found along coastlines of the Baltic Sea and southeastern North Sea in northern Europe, including all offshore islands where observations have been made (Rydell et al. 2014). This suggests bats, including Nathusiusâ pipistrelles, soprano pipistrelles, and common noctules, migrate on a broad front across the Baltic Sea and along its coasts, using small islands for stopovers. Researchers in North America also have reported activity of bats in both near and offshore habitats, suggesting impacts are highly probable at facilities located in such places. Cryan and Brown (2007) discovered longitudinal movement by hoary bats from inland summer ranges to coastal regions during autumn and winter and suggested that coastal regions with non-freezing temperatures may be important wintering areas for hoary bats. Off the coast of Maryland, Johnson et al. (2011) recorded five species of bats, including eastern red bats, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), hoary bats, tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and silver-haired bats, on a barrier island and concluded these species used this island during migration, which could have implications for wind energy development near and offshore. It seems likely that near and offshore wind facilities also will kill bats, but it is difficult or impossible to find bat fatalities at sea and no attempts to assess offshore turbine bat fatality have been made to date. Arnett and Baerwald (2013) suggested that impacts of the first several offshore wind-energy facilities proposed and built in North America, including those on inland waters such as the Great Lakes, be evaluated extensively both for fatalities and displacement effects."

IMTA promotes economic and environmental sustainability by converting byproducts and uneaten feed from fed organisms into harvestable crops, thereby reducing eutrophication, and increasing economic diversiï¬cation (Neori et al. 2004; Troell et al. 2003). IMTA has been investigated extensively in Atlantic Canada with salmon, blue mussels and kelps (Chopin et al. 2004, 2013; Ridler et al. 2006, 2007; Robinson et al. 2007). The University has been engaging commercial ï¬shermen on small-scale, IMTA as a means to diversify their income. By integrating the production of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) on a floating platform, ï¬shermen have been able to grow and sell new sources of seafood (Fig. 2.12aâb). The IMTA model was initially adopted due to concerns by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of nitrogen inputs from ï¬sh feed in coastal areas that were already nitrogen impaired. Working with state and federal agencies, a nitrogen mass balance model was derived and a IMTA demonstration project was launched in 2012 (Chambers 2013). The project sourced rainbow trout (known as steelhead in the ocean) from a local hatchery and stocked them diretly into seawater cages at 250 g. New Zealand fuzzy rope was suspended around the cage perimeter to collect mussel spat. The fuzzy rope, made from loops of polyester line, provides abundant surface area for mussel settlement. Mussels typically spawn twice a year in the Gulf of Maine and adhere to bottom substrate and materials in the water column (Langan and Horton 2005). Sugar kelp is endemic to New England waters and naturally settles on subsurface substrate. Kelp sorus tissue (sporophyte) was collected from mature kelp blades growing on the seacages and spawned in captivity. With the help of Ocean Approved in Portland, ME (http://www.oceanapproved.com/) and Maine Sea Grant, kelp spores were successfully spawned onto twines that were later seeded onto vertical and horizontal growout lines at the cage site. The UNH IMTA project demonstrated that nitrogen extraction by mussels (2.0% tissue and shell), kelp (2.4%), and trout (40% at harvest) can exceed nitrogen input from trout production. With a 4:1 ratio, 4 t of mussels/kelp to 1 t of trout, more"
225,133,0.282,"Spanish Economic Growth, 1850â2015","29. The cautious estimating procedure would, nevertheless, offset the claimed upward bias in growth rates stemming from approximating crops output from traded crops. An additional reason to choose such a rough procedure is that livestock output could be arguably seen as less volatile than crops output, and by its inclusion in the estimate of agricultural output, excess volatility would have been reduced. 30. Agrarian historians coincide in pointing to a decline in livestock output simultaneous to a rise in crops output over the late nineteenth century (GEHR 1978/1979, 1983, 1989). The literature does not address, however, the issue of over time change in animalsâ weight (most authors keep using weights per unit taken from the 1920 census by Flores de Lemus (1926)) and, more signiï¬cantly, the increased turnover of animals. GarcÃ­a Sanz (1994) shows the share of livestock slaughtered in 1865, and its differences with similar estimates for 1900 or 1930 (much closer among themselves) are striking, in particular, for cattle (the proportion in 1865 is, at least, 1â3 with respect those of 1904 or 1929), a feature consistent with the rise in urbanization within the period that brought a rise in beef consumption. Mutton consumption rose, in turn, (as sheep became increasingly less oriented towards wool production) and goatsâ meat experienced a marked decline. 31. The same procedure used for crops output was applied here. Alternatively, the 1858 livestock census could be used, but its noticeable underestimation of livestock numbers prevented me from doing it. 32. Sources used for yearly agricultural prices were Arenales (1976), Barciela (1983, 1989), Carreras (1989), ComÃ­n (1985a, c), EstadÃ­stica(s) de Comercio Exterior (various years), GEHR (1981a, b, 1989), GÃ³mez Mendoza and Simpson (1988), MartÃ­n RodrÃ­guez (1982), Ministerio de Agricultura (1974, 1979a), Ministerio de Trabajo (1942), Anuarios EstadÃ­sticos de EspaÃ±a (various years), Paris Eguilaz (1943), Piqueras (1978), Reher and Ballesteros (1993), SÃ¡nchez-Albornoz (1975, 1979, 1981) and Simpson (1994, unpublished data set). 33. Actually, since quantity indices are of Laspeyres type, price indices should be of Paasche type to derive current values (see expressions (I), (II) and (III) above). It is worth noticing that a hybrid of Laspeyres and Paasche price indices, which stems from defective statistics, is still common in todayâs national accounts (Cf. Corrales and Taguas 1991). 34. Fortunately, the small share of agricultural ï¬nal output represented by purchases outside agriculture keeps the size of the bias introduced by"

169,15,0.282,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"It is for these reasons that resilience has been applied mostly as a heuristic to help deï¬ne and explore issues in ecology and natural resource management (Quinlan et al. 2015). However, resilience has also been used as a concept within planning processes and adaptive management exercises (Roux and Foxcroft 2011; Namoi CMA 2013). Resilience can be understood as a systemâs capacity to â. . . retain its basic function and structure by absorbing the impact of disturbance and/or recovering and rebuilding post-disturbanceâ (Namoi CMA 2013). Such a deï¬nition is too general to measure precisely (Cabell and Oelofse 2012). A very wide diversity of variables has been used not as direct measurements but as indicators of separate factors that individually and collectively contribute to this capacity in different contexts. Social science applications have assessed various human capacities to cope or adapt in the face of shock or stress as indicators of resilience. These capacities have been variously deï¬ned in terms of robustness and vulnerability (Pasteur 2011; Barrett and Constas 2014),"

Species can be accidentally moved by a vehicle in many different ways, e.g. snails and slugs clinging to a train, insects flying inside a vehicle, plant seeds in passengersâ boots, or any organism that makes frequent use of cargo yards and that is loaded unintentionally loaded with the cargo. Nevertheless, despite the range of possibilities, the movement of stowaway fauna and flora is poorly documented for terrestrial transportation systems.

241,1233,0.282,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"most sensitive to wind, Norway spruce, would be favoured if deer populations survived winters better and browsed more than today on other plant species. Unless hunting increased, this would increase the sensitivity of Fennoscandian forests to wind felling (Swedish Forest Agency 2007). There is also a risk that pathogens and insects having marginal impacts under present-day conditions could become more important and that new insect pests could move in from the south. To maintain resilience, in terms of production, biodiversity and other forest uses, adaptive strategies should be considered at regeneration. For example, planting more tree species and favouring a higher number of species when cleaning and thinning than is usual today (Swedish Forest Agency 2007). Problems may also be encountered due to the higher frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as droughts, storms and spring and summer freezing (CCIRG 1996; Nikulin et al. 2011), with consequent damage to forests. The Baltic Sea basin has only a few tree species of economic importance in forestry, such as Scots pine, Norway spruce, birch and oak. However, changing tree species composition may be an appropriate adaptive management strategy (Ge et al. 2011a). The following changes in tree species composition are possible adaptive management strategies: â¢ A shift from mono-species to mixed species stands (see KolstrÃ¶m et al. 2011). â¢ Incorporating other indigenous tree species, currently of minor importance in forestry, but with high potential for timber production or carbon sequestration under climate change. â¢ Increasing the share of broadleaved species assumed to perform better under climate change. â¢ Substituting species sensitive to drought and late spring frosts by drought-tolerant and frost-resistant tree species or provenances. â¢ Replacing low-productivity tree populations with high productivity ones when the current population does not make full use of the potential productivity of a site. Changing tree species can be an appropriate adaptive management strategy for improving productivity, which also includes the adjustment of thinning (intensity, interval, pattern: from above/below). In this context, adjusting the rotation period is an effective means of managing timber production and the carbon budget of forests. Over the rotation, the timing and intensity of thinning determine the growth rate and stocking, which control the rate of carbon sequestration and the amount of carbon retained in trees and soils. In most European countries, growing stock is still increasing, because timber harvest (thinning, ï¬nal felling) is less than the increment. This means that the total carbon storage in the forest is increasing. On the other hand, the age-class distribution of the forests in the Baltic Sea basin is shifting towards the older age classes, and the overall length"
38,65,0.282,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Trends in ecosystem extent and distribution are highly dependent on the scale of the evaluation being undertaken. For example, at a given scale, coastal wetlands may appear to be uninterrupted and uniform. However, at a more resolved scale, edges, patches, corridors associated with tidal creeks, and discontinuous distributions of species become evident. Forested and tree rich landscapes have a high connectivity for forest birds, but that may not be the case for carabid beetles and butterflies. Deï¬ning systems in terms of local organisation or dominant species facilitates discussion and analysis, but may also obscure the important linkages between systems across landscapes. It is therefore important to deï¬ne the systems under consideration and the appropriate scale and resolution at which to observe and analyse them, before discussing trends in their extent and distribution. Trends in the extent and distribution of ecological systems depend on the temporal and spatial scale of the assessment. Temporal changes occur naturally over long time scales, such as those associated with geological and climatological forces (e.g., glaciation). Change can also occur more quickly as a result of direct shifts in land use such as deforestation and urbanisation or the drainage of wetlands. Thus, trends can be the result of natural forces but may be accelerated by human pressure or exclusively due to human activities. RS products have a high potential for mapping habitat extent and distribution maps at various scales. Hyperspatial (very high resolution) and hyperspectral sensors have greatly enhanced the possibilities of distinguishing related habitat types at very ï¬ne scales. The end-users can use such maps for estimating range and area of habitats, but they could also serve to deï¬ne and update the sampling frame (the statistical âpopulationâ) of habitats for which ï¬eld sample surveys are in place."

302,279,0.281,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"In contrast to marine studies, only one filter-feeding freshwater species, D. magna, has been tested thoroughly in chronic and acute exposure regimes. Acute toxicity testing over 96 h resulted in an elevated immobilization at extremely high concentrations of 1 Î¼m polyethylene (PE) particles [34]. With a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 75.3 mg L 1, these acute effects are (presumably) not environmentally relevant. Compared to this, chronic exposure to nanoscale PS over 21 days (0.22â150 mg L 1, [41]) was not lethal. However, high concentrations of nano-PS (>30 mg L 1) induced neonatal malformations and slightly decreased the reproductive output. Interestingly, the mortality as well as the amount of malformations increased when the daphnids were fed with nano-PS incubated algae (5 days). Since nano-PS particles might be too small for a direct ingestion, the formation of particle-algae aggregates may have resulted in a higher exposure. Furthermore, nano-PS reduced the growth and the chlorophyll a content of algae (Scenedesmus obliquus) indicating a reduced nutritional value of algae cultured with polymer particles. Ogonowski et al. [35] conducted life-history experiments with D. magna exposed to primary MPs (spherical beads, 1.3 g cm 3, 4.1 Î¼m), secondary MPs (PE fragments, 1.0 g cm 3, 2.6 Î¼m), and kaolin (2.6 g cm 3, 4.4 Î¼m) under foodlimited conditions. They observed an increased mortality and slightly decreased reproduction of daphnids for the highest concentration of secondary MPs (105 P mL 1). However, incoherent exposure regimes (different particle sizes, concentrations, and exposure durations, among others) limit a general comparability and conclusion. In fact, the strongest response was driven by the low amount of food (reproduction far below validation criteria, OECD). However, these studies illustrate that (a) adverse effects depend on several factors, e.g., the size and shape of primary vs. secondary MPs, particle concentrations, polymer densities, as"

This involves the use of bamboo skirts that cover the top of the collection pot and the shaved part of the palm tree (Nahar et al. 2010) and has been enthusiastically adopted by palm sap collectors (gachhis) (Fig. 13.5). Without it, date palm sap contaminated with bat faeces and urine is of lower quality and value, and, importantly, the risk of Nipah virus transmission is also reduced by using bamboo skirts over collection pots (Nahar et al. 2010)."

230,564,0.281,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"13.6 Conclusions and Future Work This short account has identified some of the most widely encountered plastics in everyday use and illustrated some of the attempts that have been made to assess their potential hazards to human health. Different routes of exposure to human populations, both of plastic additives, micro- and nanoplastics from food items and from discarded debris are discussed in relation to the existing literature for nanomedicines and nanocomposite packaging materials, for which an increasing body of knowledge exists. It is clear that our understanding of the potential contamination of the human population by micro- or nanoplastics sourced from the environment is in its infancy, leaving many questions unanswered: â¢ Does significant bioaccumulation and trophic transfer for micro- and nanoplastics occur in the environment? If so, what species are most at risk? â¢ How does ageing of plastics affect their physico-chemical properties and subsequent toxicity? â¢ Following ingestion, does uptake of micro- and nanoplastics occur? Do proteins bind to the surface of the particles to form a protein corona? How does this vary for different plastic litter types and what cell types are most vulnerable to toxicity? â¢ What methods should we be using for locating, identifying and quantifying micro- and nanoplastics in complex matrices including biological tissues? Techniques mentioned in this chapter include field flow fractionation, multiangled light scattering (MALS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and non-linear optical bioimaging. Further development of suitable methods for extracting micro- and nanoplastics from biological materials and for studying them in situ remains a compelling research gap for the future.

198,528,0.281,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Over 90 % of the activities were completed by the end of the study period. Early outcomes from the interventions was achieved around reduction of distances to water points, increased access to good quality water for the resident and neighbouring communities, increased capacity of traditional natural resource governance committees (dedhas), proper diagnosis of livestock diseases and strengthened local capacity for natural resource management. With respect to measuring resilience literature has shown that there are no universal or generally applicable indicators of resilience (or of vulnerability or adaptive capacity), as these phenomena are highly context-specific. However, a number of studies have sought to define dimensions of resilience, with each dimension gathering together a suite of related factors that might be represented by context-specific indicators (Alexander 201316; Nguyen and James 201317). However for the purposes of this study, social or livelihood resilience as defined by Eakin (2012)18 and Tanner et al. (2015)19 was used as it was fit for purpose."
10,373,0.281,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The interview campaigns held within the DROP project highlighted that the broad public is in general unaware of the risks and challenges water providers are facing due to drought. Users are accustomed to a high quality of service 24 h a day, 7 days a week; service interruption is seen as someone not having done his homework, rather than a possibility that can arise as a result of different natural risks to service provision. In addition, stakeholders highlighted that the broad public is typically unaware of the sources of their drinking water. In the Eifel-Rur region, for instance, the overall public perception is that the reservoirs provide other more visible services than drinking water, such as flood protection or opportunities for sailing and tourism attraction. This lack of awareness is a drawback when trying to communicate drought risks to the broader public (La Jeunesse et al. 2015). Communication on droughts faces additional challenges in these flood-prone regions. These highly visible impacting events convey to the broader public the idea that a certain regionâs problems are related to dealing with too much water, and not too little of it, as far as reservoirs are managed for protection against floods and also sustain stream flows during low-flows periods. Conveying the concept that flood risk does not imply an absence of drought risk is a communicational challenge. Awareness of the topic among stakeholder groups seems not much higher than that of the broader public. Stakeholders, in general, do not consider drought and water scarcity issue as urgent from their perspective, and there is a lot of interest in keeping up business as usual or even in expanding water uses. The exceptions to this rule are the drinking water providers themselvesâsome proof is given by the fact that the water boards IAV and WVER are part of the DROP project, and in Flanders drinking water providers also counted this issue as on their agenda. Beyond drinking water providers, some environmental authorities considered were showing interest in the issue, fundamentally due to the environmental problems that could derive of the low flows. Somewhat surprisingly, environmental NGOs in the"
230,18,0.281,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"1.1 Introduction From messages in bottles to exotic tropical seeds washing up on temperate shores (Guppy 1917; Muir 1937), the dispersal of floating debris at sea has long fascinated people. As early as 1870 Jules Verne provided a graphic description of how floating debris accumulates in ocean gyres in the chapter on the Sargasso Sea in his famous novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea. However, this review focuses on the last 50 years because from the perspective of environmental impacts the history of marine litter research is closely linked to the development of plastics. Plastics are a diverse group of synthetic polymers that have their origins in the late 19th century, but which really came to the fore in the mid-twentieth century. Their low density, durability, excellent barrier properties and relatively low cost make plastics ideal materials for a wide range of manufacturing and packaging applications. Their versatility has seen the amount of plastic produced annually increase rapidly over the last few decades to an estimated 288 million tonnes in 2012 (Fig. 1.1), and this total continues to grow at about 4 % per year (PlasticsEurope 2013). However, the properties that make plastics so useful also make inappropriately handled waste plastics a significant environmental threat. Their durability means that they persist in the environment for many years, and their low density means that they are readily dispersed by water and wind, sometimes travelling thousands of kilometres from source areas (Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, plastic wastes are now ubiquitous pollutants in even the most remote areas of the world (Barnes et al. 2009). Over the last 60 years we have seen a major shift in perception surrounding the use of plastics, especially in one-off applications. Once seen as the savior of the American housewife (Life Magazine 1955), there are now calls to treat waste plastics as hazardous materials (Rochman et al. 2013a), reiterating a point first made by Bean (1987) that persistent plastic wastes qualify as hazardous wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Freshwater conservation has therefore been a priority among environmental NGOs for decades. In fact, many local or national NGOs and initiatives were formed as a direct consequence of too little to no governmental action toward sustainable management of freshwater resources. Many international NGOs, such as WWF, also started to act because of the crucial role water resources play in the context of human development globally. They function as advocates for integration of local, regional, and international water policies, for a proper scienceâpolicy interface, and for adequate stakeholder involvement in decision-making in order to ensure that the needs of both nature and local communities are being met. In the following text, we will present three case studies that illustrate how environmental NGOs can make a difference and what challenges they face."

Frequently this means that what begins as a minor issue, combined with adverse conditions over several days, eventually causes major damage and there is absolutely nothing on-site personnel can do to prevent it. In some cases main component issues such as mooring failures or broken structural pieces will not result in a permanent setback to a project. Other situations, however, such as gaping holes in netting, cages breaking free and going adrift/sinking, or catastrophic failure of an entire cage system present an entirely different set of circumstances. The offshore environment is extremely challenging and it should be noted that every project in the GoM to date has had one or several of these events occur, often simultaneously. In addition to the high energy environment of the GoM, another serious issue with netting and other containment materials is biofouling. The wave and current forces exerted on the cage systems stress the components and as barnacles, hydroids, and other organisms accumulate this stress increases. Antifouling paint and other coatings are available and were applied to cage materials however these are meant to reduce biofouling and are not capable of eliminating it altogether. Each year during the spring and early summer the GoM waters begin to warm and a signiï¬cant amount of fouling occurred very quickly on the cage systems. The only options available are to either clean a cage in place or replace components when the accumulation becomes severe. Needless to say, the challenge of changing a 30â 40 m diameter net that weighs several tons in the offshore GoM environment resulted in the cleaning option being employed. Figure 13.4 shows the preventative effect of copper based antifoulant paint on ï¬berglass panels on the left, with the top row being the treated samples. On the right the drag created by a virtual carpet of hydroids is seen on cage netting in a strong current. In addition to creating additional stress on all the system components, the deformation of much of the netting also effectively reduced the cage volume signiï¬cantly. Any future offshore projects in the Gulf, however, will have to seriously consider biofouling and how to prevent and adequately deal with the inevitable growth of numerous marine organisms, particularly on the netting or containment materials. Logistically speaking, operating at exposed locations offshore is signiï¬cantly more expensive than onshore and near shore sites, largely due to transportation costs. Personnel, cage systems, maintenance equipment, ï¬sh, and feed are some of items that have to be transported by either air or sea to the project site whether the platform involved is manned or unmanned. Both platform situations have been tried during the GoM projects and each had its advantages as well as disadvantages. Certainly having a large, stable structure with multiple decks, living quarters, a power supply and crane in an otherwise uninhabitable offshore environment is an asset to an aquaculture venture. In the two projects off the coast of Texas, cages were either attached directly to the legs of a platform or mooring lines from the system were connected to the structure(s) at various points as shown in Fig. 13.5."

376,156,0.281,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","has found that it is much lower and close to that of the native poplars and willows that grow in riparian systems of the southwest. Therefore, removal of these plants would have little effect on water loss if native riparian shrubs remain (Nagler et al. 2009; Shafroth et al. 2010b; Doody et al. 2011). Similar work in Australia found that although invasive Salix species in the river channel can use large quantities of water (Â±2000 mm yearâ1 vs. 1500 mm yearâ1 for open water), overall ET for this invasive species is very similar to that found for native riparian Eucalyptus forest (Doody and Benyon 2011; Doody et al. 2011). In the floodplain of the perennial San Pedro River in Arizona, Prosopis woodlands have replaced native grasslands, increasing ET from 407 to 639 mm yearâ1 (Scott et al. 2006). Evapotranspiration from Prosopis woodlands in floodplains linked to perennial rivers ranges from about 350 to 750 mm yearâ1 (Scott et al. 2004, 2008), which suggests that other perennial river systems (such as those in South Africa where native tree species such as Acacia karroo are sparse or absent) could be similarly affected by invasion of non-native species. The Working for Water program in South Africa, a national initiative for removal of invasive plants, emphasizes clearing to increase river flows (van Wilgen et al. 1998). Extensive invasions by Acacia mearnsii, Eucalyptus species, willows, and poplars have taken place along perennial rivers in the arid grasslands and savannas of the interior, where the native riparian species are mainly shrubs or small trees. If the difference between the annual ET from stands of these species and that from native species is as much as indicated by some studies (Dye and Jarmain 2004), or by data for willows and eucalypts from Doody and Benyon (2011) and Doody et al. (2011), removal could lead to an increase in river flows that would be substantial and very important for downstream water users and ecosystems. However, there may be other cases in which streamflows could be significantly reduced, such as invasions of species that are high water users along ephemeral streams (Doody et al. 2011; Hultine and Bush 2011). The distinct species composition, structure, and dynamics of riparian environments generate a suite of ecosystem services very different from that of dryland environments. This makes them a key resource area, particularly in developing countries where they are less likely to have undergone extensive transformation by agriculture and other activities (Tockner and Stanford 2002; Kgathi et al. 2005; Brauman et al. 2007). Recent work has also documented the extent to which large fauna can alter riparian processes. For example, in riparian ecosystems, large-scale earthworks are created mainly by the activities of fauna, particularly large mammals, which shape floodplains at a range of scales, from the microtopographical to that of river channels (Naiman and Rogers 1997; Moore 2006). Ecosystem modifications brought about by beavers, through the construction of dams, have been well studied; but much less is known about the ecological roles played by large mammals. In wetlands like the Okavango, large mammals (elephant, buffalo, hippopotamus) open up flow paths for water through reeds, changing water circulation patterns. Similarly, warthogs carve out feeding patches that form temporary pools during the wet season, creating habitats for many other species to complete their life cycles. Riparian vegetation provides important feedbacks to the river system: it captures and stabilizes sediments, shapes river channels, and determines and regulates biotic"

378,132,0.281,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"None of this can be captured by exchange value or market prices. The governance of nature requires multidimensional evidence instead of the typical monetized costâbeneï¬t analyses that are popular in policymaking. In those natural protection measures, investment in education, extent of social welfare, etc., are judged by quantifying their value in monetary terms. Equipped with those numbers one can calculate when it is âeconomicâ to implement them. There are no general standards as to how this conversion should be done, so it is down to the ethical judgments and mind-set of theâoften economics-trainedâpolicy advisor: what is the monetary value of a human life? How much should saving thousands of lives a year through tougher pollution standards therefore be allowed to cost? When is it too expensive? Whose competitiveness might be impacted by the higher costs of production? When it comes to presenting the âevidence,â numerical equations radiate the aura of objectivity. But digging into what twenty-ï¬rst century science tells us about nature renders equations unsuitable for sound economic governance. Ecological economists like Daly therefore demand a precautionary approach that starts from the premise that certain functions of natureâsome of its lawsâcannot be duplicated by humans but are essential to the continuation of human prosperity on this planet, at least for the foreseeable future. They determine the quantity of and rate at which nature develops the low entropy resources that humans use. For example, the humus in fertile soil that takes up to 2000 years to form, and the fossil fuels that started forming 300 to 400 million year ago. Likewise the way that high entropy waste in the form of emissions, chemicals and heat can be absorbed by plants, soil, water, and so on.

Annual Florida pink shrimp catch averaged 11.2 million pounds between 1960 and 2007 (Figure 8.28). Record numbers of Florida pink shrimp were landed in 1996 at 18.9 million pounds, but the catch subsequently declined and has remained near or below the long-term mean. Catches on the Tortugas grounds decreased considerably during 2005, 2006, and 2007 (Hart 2008). Fishing effort in the Tortugas fishery was at a constant level from 1960 through the mid-1980s (average of 16.3 thousand days, Hart 2008) (Figure 8.29). Effort then dropped in the late 1980s and early 1990s but peaked in 1995 at 25 thousand days fished. Effort then fluctuated over the following years but began a continuous decline in 2002â2003 of 13 thousand days fished to 6.0 and 3.0 thousand days fished for the western coast of Florida and the Tortugas, respectively. These levels are most likely due to economic conditions in the fishery community, such as devastation caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, an increase in low-cost shrimp imports, and an increase in fuel prices (Haby et al. 2003). CPUE for fishery-dependent data of Florida pink shrimp averaged 598 lb per day fished during 1960â1985 on the Tortugas grounds (Figure 8.30; Hart 2008). The CPUE was below average between 1986 and 1994 and then fluctuated a few years until 1999 when CPUE equaled 349 lb per day fished, the lowest value recorded over the entire data set on the Tortugas fishing grounds. The CPUE then began climbing to a high of 736 lb per day fished in 2005 and a drop in 2006 to 615 days, which was still one of the highest levels recorded over the past 20 years. So, as noted above, catch and effort declined, yet CPUE remained high. Thus, relative abundance of the Florida pink shrimp in the Tortugas fishery as measured by CPUE has been stable over the long-term data set for that area. This is an indication that the fishery is most likely not in decline and that the primary reason for the low harvest numbers is due to economic and not biological conditions (Hart 2008). A close examination of these latter trends and modeling efforts is provided by Hart and Nance (2010). Historical and modern pink shrimp catch distribution is shown in Figure 8.31 (Osborn et al. 1969; NOAA 2011b)."

However, as it was mentioned previously, the invasion rate has accelerated enormously since the 1950s mainly due to human activities (such as maritime transportation and habitat change). Moreover, synergistic effects of factors such as pollution, eutrophication, overfishing and climate change stimulate new invasions (Fig. 4.2). Changes in environmental conditions and human pressure have on the one hand resulted in the elimination of highly specialised or sensitive native species from the Baltic ecosystem, while on the other hand they have generated and opened niches that have been quickly inhabited by new species. To some extent, the process of bioinvasion can be regarded as positive when species richness and taxonomic diversity are considered. For example, studies on the widespread Baltic invasive polychaete Marenzelleria spp. have shown that although this species has become dominant, it has not adversely affected deeper benthic communities, since it fills an âemptyâ niche. However, in shallow waters this has not been the case, and Marenzelleria spp. competes with the native polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor and affects the abundance of the amphipod Monoporeia affinis (DidÅ¾iulis 2006; Kotta and Olafsson 2003). Other positive consequences of alien species introduction include human benefits from both AS and IAS which has actually polarised public perceptions about bioinvasion. For example, Eriocheir sinensis (Chinese mitten crab), a famous"

When prompted, the GIS-prepared climate change maps can be helpful in raising the climate change awareness among public and these maps should, therefore, be prepared. Climate change affects food production, with particular reference to urban agriculture and the associated impacts on food security. The value of urban agriculture to the health and nutrition of developing and developed countries needs to be assessed. There are international, including urban, aspects, such as agricultural disruption, economic disruption and logistical disruption to food availability, food access and food quality as a result of natural disasters remains an under-investigated topic. Climate change is affecting (and will affect) global food production and hence global food security. Urban agriculture plays a signiï¬cant role in maintaining and improving the health of city dwellers, particularly those disadvantaged. Climate change is likely to impact more severely urban environments with associated negative effects on food security. Existing research programmes are not addressing these aspects of climate change and deserve attention. Social, economic and environmental impacts on urban and peri-urban Indigenous communities inhabiting coastal areas need to be highlighted. These impacts include loss of community and environmental assets, such as cultural heritage sites, with signiï¬cant impacts on their quality of life and the establishment of potential favourable conditions for the spread of plant diseases, weeds and pests. Opportunities do not readily exist for engagement with climate change adaptation policy and initiatives and this is further exacerbated by acute shortages of qualiï¬ed/experienced indigenous members that could represent their communitiesâ interests in climate change adaptation forums. The evidence emerging from research shows that consideration of the future by many communities, even with the overlay of climate change and the requirements for serious considerations of adaptation, are signiï¬cantly inï¬uenced by economic aspirations which are seen as fundamental survival strategies for their communities. There are a number of local-speciï¬c issues that emerge from climate change, such as potential for indigenous involvement in the industry utilising wild plant species that may suffer from changes in species availability; concern about changes associated with peri-urban and urban development which appears to be escalating micro-environmental changes; peri-urbanisation as a major environmental change which threatens cultural assets; and indigenous communities that need to be represented in climate change adaptation forums and be more directly involved in land and sea care projects. Climate change awareness is an imperative to achieve sustainability in developing countries. Lack of awareness is a signiï¬cant barrier to climate change adaptation. Raising climate change awareness at the local level is critical, as climate change impacts are exacerbating the number and extent of disasters in different parts of the world. The development of an adaptation plan must be founded on a risk management approach to climate change at the local peri-urban government level. The approach can help build capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment and deï¬ne the area of operation, inï¬uence and responsibility in"

This scoring system was implemented in three phases according to the methods described in detail the report First, a single index value was computed from all primary symptoms. The scoring system gave equal weight to all three symptoms and considered the spatial and temporal characteristics of each. The scores for the three symptoms were then averaged, resulting in the highest values being assigned to estuaries having multiple primary symptoms that occur with great frequency, over large spatial areas of the estuary, and for extended periods of time. Likewise, the lowest scores indicate estuaries that exhibit few, if any, characteristics of the primary symptoms Next, a single index value was computed from all secondary symptoms. The scoring system again gave equal weight to all symptoms and their spatial and temporal characteristics. The highest score of any of the three symptoms was then chosen as the overall secondary value for the estuary. This weights the secondary symptoms higher than the primary symptoms, because the secondary symptoms take longer to develop, thereby indicating a more chronic problem, and being more indicative of actual impacts to the estuary Finally, the range of numeric scores assigned to primary and secondary symptoms was divided into categories of high, moderate, and low. Primary and secondary scores were then compared in a matrix so that overall categories could be assigned to the estuaries Estuaries having high scores for both primary and secondary conditions were considered to have an overall âhighâ level of eutrophication. Likewise, estuaries with low primary and secondary values were assigned an overall âlowâ level of eutrophication.

180,322,0.28,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Environmental health and occupational health and safety have long been established subfields of public health research, policy, and practice (Frumkin 2010). More so perhaps than areas such as infectious disease or health promotion, environmental and occupational health remind us that the health of a society is profoundly affected by its economic system and economic development. Today, the environmental health field is largely concerned with a human-made (anthropogenic) environment brought about by urbanization, the extraction of natural resources, industrial manufacture, the physical separation of home and workplace, and the transportation systems needed to support this mode of economy and pattern of living. Economic development alters the natural environment and sometimes harms ecosystems in terms of the humanly useful services they provide, their diversity, and their resilience. We are coming to understand that all of this has significant consequences for human health. Environmental health has been understood as a public health issue in relation to air quality, water quality, and exposure to environmental pollutants that are toxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic or are chemically bioactive in other ways. The rise of fossil fuels as the energy base for economic production and transportation, the industrial-scale advances in mining and metallurgy, and the creation and widespread presence of synthetic chemical substances have contributed to environmental health risks throughout the past two centuries. Indeed, these changes have redefined the meaning of environmental health.

Here we present some of the important considerations speciï¬c to freshwater biodiversity monitoring described by Turak et al. (2016) together with additional information that would be useful for biodiversity observation networks. We have organised this information under the six broad classes of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs; Pereira et al. 2013): i.e., genetic composition, species populations, species traits, community composition ecosystem structure, and ecosystem functioning. We stress, however, that some widely-used indicators for the condition of freshwater ecosystems (e.g., water quality variables) do not ï¬t neatly into these categories."

Natural gas exports, which consist of 90 percent of overall export, have pushed national economic growth. The extractive sector accounts for nearly half of Turkmenistanâs GDP. Although the country has made a significant progress in macroeconomic indicators, the quality of Turkmenistanâs human capitalâits health and education systemsâlags behind most other comparable nations, such as Azerbaijan or Ukraine. Moreover, âthe Human Development Index (HDI), a composite statistic of life expectancy; education; and income, shows that despite the enormous increase in income per capita experienced in recent years, improvements of health and education outcomes are not remarkable.â The people of Turkmenistan have lower life expectancy than most neighbors, let alone the populations of more developed resource-rich countries around the world. Current employment rates of 55 percent and a labor force participation rate of 61 percent for the 15â64-year-old population are low by international standards. According to the same study, with the working age population projected to increase by one-third in 2030, investment in human capital is insufficient to allow the next generation of Turkmen citizens to find jobs. Despite this wealth, affluence has not trickled down enough to the general population. Rural areas remain notably poor and underdeveloped. The state budget provides funds to subsidize citizensâ home heating, gasoline, electricity, water, flour and salt. However, people in rural areas do not have guaranteed access to clean drinking water and electricity outages are not unusual. Although Turkmenistan does not participate in global assessments such as PISA or TIMSS, the quality of education and its alignment to the present and future needs of the economy are questionable. Education transformation under the first president of Turkmenistan led to decreasing educational provision on all levels. Relatively recently the Turkmen government has made an attempt to reverse this negative trend. The Turkmenistan Presidentâs Decree on the âImprovement of the Education System in Turkmenistanâ (2013) and the âConcept of Transition to 12-year General Secondary Education in Turkmenistanâ were adopted, which aim at radical reforms in the education sector. These reforms are reaching a great number of the population. They include costly projects, ranging from introduction of internet access to building new campuses for HEIs that are made possible by the governmentâs access to energy wealth."

FFL has two main aims: first the physical removal of marine litter from the seabed (Fig. 15.1) and, second, to raise awareness within the fishing industry that it is not acceptable to throw litter overboard. Participating vessels are given large bags to store marine litter that collects in their nets during normal fishing activities. The concept of FFL has received support within the fishing industry with increasing numbers of vessels participating in this activity over the past seven years (OSPAR 2010a).

Driven by the rediscovery of long forgotten, 1970s studies on the occurrence of small plastic fragments (today termed microplastics) in the oceans, oceanographers and marine biologists resurrected the topic in the early 2000s. Since then, the field has rapidly expanded and established that plastics are ubiquitous in the marine system, from the Arctic to Antarctic and from the surface to the deep sea. While obviously the sources of environmental plastics are land-based, much less research has been dedicated to investigating them in freshwater systems. At the time of writing this book, less than four percent of publications had a freshwater context, reflecting the idea that streams, rivers, and lakes are mere transport routes transferring plastics to the oceans similar to a sewer. Because this is too simplistic, this book is dedicated to the in-between. Our authors explore the state of the science, including the major advances and challenges, with regard to the sources, fate, abundance, and impacts of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems. Despite the many gaps in our knowledge, we highlight that microplastics are pollutants of emerging concern independent of the salinity of the surrounding medium. Environmental (micro)plastics are what some call a wicked problem, i.e., there is considerable complexity involved when one tries to understand the impact of these synthetic materials on the natural world. Just as an example, there is no such thing as âthe microplastic.â Currently, there are in commerce more than 5,300 grades of synthetic polymers.1 Their heterogeneous physico-chemical properties will likely result in very heterogeneous fates and effects once they enter the According to the plastics industryâs information system CAMPUS (http://www.campusplastics. com, last visited on June 20, 2017)."

Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known"

255,79,0.279,Railway Ecology,"Crossing Structures The structures that facilitate wildlife crossing of railways can be part of the original engineering design of the infrastructure; these include culverts or bridges over roads or rivers, even when that was not their original purpose. At other times, these structures can become wildlife crossing locations with just minor adaptations, as happens with dry ledges. Alternatively, structures can be built with the speciï¬c goal of enabling movements across the linear infrastructure, usually designated as wildlife underpasses or overpasses. Although crossing structures contribute to mitigating both mortality and barrier effects of linear infrastructures (Dorsey et al. 2015), their main role has been focused on barrier effects, ensuring connectivity through the landscapes crossed by railways and roads (Glista et al. 2009; Jackson and Grifï¬n 2000; van der Ree et al. 2008). In this book, the application of crossing structures as a mitigation measure in railways is described in greater detail in Chap. 4. Here, we give a short description of the most frequently used crossing structures, and how they may help reduce wildlife mortality on railways. Pipe culverts are small structures designed to let water flow under the railway, being regularly flooded during the rainy seasons. Pipe culverts form part of the design of most linear infrastructures and are sometimes used by small animals (Glista et al. 2009; Jackson and Grifï¬n 2000). The efï¬ciency of pipe culverts in reducing mortality would increase if it were associated with railway exclusion methods (see section below). Box culverts are also designed for water drainage, and being larger than pipe culverts, often remain dry except in periods of heavy run-off. Box culverts are generally better as crossing structures than pipe culverts (Glista et al. 2009). Culverts can be adapted before or after construction to facilitate their use by wildlife (Clevenger and Waltho 1999; Jackson and Grifï¬n 2000; RodrÃ­guez et al. 1996), namely by (1) including dry ledges, (2) modifying habitats at entrances,"

Any scientific analysis is only as good as the data used, and data on fish stocks gathered by survey vessels and partially validated by fisheriesâ data is often unreliable and always incomplete. Further, ecosystems such as maritime environments are a dynamic entity with stochastic effects and uncertain dynamics. There are increasing calls for improved concepts of uncertainty treatment and improved methodology in the characterisation, consideration, communication and management of uncertainty for scientific assessment and advice. It has been argued, for example, by Dankel et al. (2012), that a better understanding of how to characterise scientific uncertainty and its implications are needed. However, according to our interviewees, the underlying problem has still not been resolved, namely, that DG MARE wants numbers, whilst ICESâs scientists prefer to give more qualitative and nuanced information. This poses a fundamental problem for the whole management process: ICES is expected to deliver recommendations as sound and clear as possible in order for DG MARE to draft proposals for action. ICESâ advice, on the other hand, has to be legitimate and definitive, i.e. it cannot be open to different interpretations by different stakeholders (Wilson 2009: 124). That there is uncertainty, however, has to be somehow communicated for the advice to become credible, but how exactly uncertainty should and can be communicated to DG MARE is an ongoing discussion, not least because of different understandings of uncertainty between ICES and DG MARE. This is referred to as âinstitutional uncertaintyâ (Linke et al. 2014). Industry representatives in all countries generally felt more comfortable with management decisions made by the Council of Ministers, partly because the latter did not fully follow the advice of ICES. Industrialists felt that NGOs read ICESâ advice all too literally. They on the other hand understood the uncertainties involved and thus expected decision makers to set different TACs than those of ICES. Unsurprisingly, NGO representatives were very much in favour of the precautionary approach to scientific uncertainties. They felt that given the lack of or the unreliability of data, the precautionary approach would better address concerns of sustainable management of resources. Representatives from ICES on the other hand were less perturbed. They saw themselves as delivering a service to DG MARE based on the available resources and knowledge. In their view, their assessment was mainly a biologicalâeconomic one. They did not see a threat of species extinction. Rather, they were concerned that if TACs were set too high, economic problems might arise. DG MARE representatives saw the problem similarly and referred mainly to the challenges of data reliability and communication of uncertainty. Further, they felt that local and anecdotal knowledge about fish stocks should be taken seriously."

We have added an institutional component to the model where the exposure term for the institutional subsystem is the vulnerability of the social subsystem. Vulnerability of the institutional subsystem feeds back to the socioeconomic and the ecological subsystems. Institutional components can be market structures, as when collapse of livestock enterprises led to restructuring of the regional livestock market in the 2012 drought in the USA. Institutional components involve government intervention as in the case with drought relief programs in the USA or national relief following dzud (severe winter weather disaster) in Mongolia. These interventions often do not reflect collective learning or desired collection action across the social and the institutional subsystems and thus may not facilitate resilient decision making at the enterprise or individual level (Thurow and Taylor 1999; FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez et al. 2012). As new markets, new government regulations, and climate change introduce new learning opportunities, vulnerabilities can arise at the household unit or livestock enterprise."
246,123,0.279,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The Current Status of Populations Europeâs large carnivores are currently distributed among 42 nations, each with unique cultural values for biodiversity and different legal platforms for conservation. This cultural, political, and legal diversity within Europe presents major challenges for the conservation of internationally listed species, which often exist in transboundary populations that fall across several international jurisdictions. Management fragmentation is made worse by the fact that many European countries (e.g. Austria, Spain, Germany) are federal countries where responsibility for nature conservation has been decentralised to many sub-national jurisdictions. Large carnivores have all the characteristics of species that are difficult to manage at the scale of Europeâs small administrative units: they live at low densities (typically less than 3/100 km2), have home range size up to 1000 km2 and dispersal distances of more than 1000 km (Linnell and Boitani 2012). In an attempt to facilitate carnivore management at the appropriate scale of biologically meaningful units instead of administrative compartments, the European Commission approved a set of âGuidelines for population level management plansâ (Linnell et al. 2008) and identified the main populations across the continent. The populations were identified based on several criteria such as the discontinuity in distribution, geographic features, the speciesâ dispersal distance and the ecological and management contexts. Out of 30 populations (see below), only four occur within a single country and some span up to eight countries. Kaczensky et al. (2013) recently reviewed the conservation status of the European large carnivores in 2012 using data collected by a network of experts across Europe.

255,155,0.279,Railway Ecology,"Abstract In this chapter, we review the level of disturbance caused by railways due to noise and vibration, air, soil and water pollution, and soil erosion. There is evidence that soil and hydrology contamination may affect vegetation and aquatic fauna while noise can affect terrestrial vertebrates. In fact, noise, light, and vibration due to railways have been observed to reduce the abundance and richness of some insects, amphibians, and birds, and to cause avoidance behaviour on predators. Interestingly, reptiles, some bird species, small mammals, and large mammals seem to ignore rail trafï¬c and beneï¬t from the vegetation planted in the railway verges that provide food and shelter. Some engineering structures have been implemented to reduce the effects of railway disturbance: rail fastenings, rail dampers, under-sleeper pads, and noise barriers are applied to minimize noise and vibration; washing with water and cleaning the ballast are used to mitigate soil pollution; and grass plantation, the use of gypsum and application of compost/mulch coverage, are applied to control soil erosion.

169,554,0.279,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The Ecological Assessment of River Quality Is Older than the Science of Ecology There is a simple answer to the question âSince when do we need water quality assessment?â: since humans destroyed their surface waters in a way that deteriorated drinking water quality. The ï¬rst written record of water pollution was given about 350 years before Christ, when Aristotle reported on âblack mudâ and âred tubesââas he called itâgrowing out of a âwhite slimeâ in brooks of the city Megara polluted by domestic sewage (Thienemann 1912). The famous Greek philosopher was the ï¬rst who linked human pressures with observations of oxygen reduction (black decaying mud), a community of Beggiatoa sulfur bacteria (white slime), oligochaete sludge worms, and chironomids (red tubes). Aristotleâs knowledge fell into oblivion, and the beginning of water quality assessment had to wait for about 1800 years. Anyhow, observations of a correlation between the composition/distribution of certain aquatic invertebrate species and different water pollution levels are not very recent ï¬ndings. One could even say that this knowledge is older than âecologyâ itself (as deï¬ned by Ernst Haeckel in 1866). As early as Kolenati (1848), it was already concluded by F. A. Kolenati that the absence of caddis larvae from a stream can be caused by the presence of factories upstream (Stettiner Entomologische Zeitung 9). Triggered by the severe cholera epidemics in Europe, two researchers, A. H. Hassal, London (1850), and F. Cohn, Breslau (1853), discovered and published the relationship between organic pollution, river fauna, and the quality of drinking water based on bioindicators. In the United States, the earliest biomonitoring research originates from Forbes (1887) who invented the biological community concept. Basically, using this concept plant and animal communities of a river were used to assess the degree of organic pollution. Around 1900 two German scientists (R. Kolkwitz & M. Marsson) studied polluted rivers around Berlin and described deï¬ned communities of organisms in different zones of organic enrichment. They developed the concept of âbiological indicators of pollutionâ in their so-called saprobic system, which is still in use in several Central and Eastern European states."
302,489,0.278,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Once in natural water bodies (rivers, lakes, oceans), recovery of microplastics is impossible. Therefore, one challenge is to identify and quantify the upstream sources â a prerequisite to mitigation. In the cases of microbeads and preproduction pellets, we witnessed the role of science to present observations of microplastic pollution, followed by a movement to pressure policymakers to regulate industry. The work of scientists continues to illuminate microplastic impacts, such as recent reports from the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) [118], a working group gathered by UNEP to synthesize and report on the state of the scientific evidence regarding the plastic pollution issue and distribute the information to the United Nations Environment Assembly. There are four principal solutions that will have high impact on preventing terrestrial and freshwater microplastics from forming. They are: (1) identify and quantify terrestrial microplastic sources, (2) scale zero waste strategies, (3) pursue policy-driven EPR, and (4) develop novel business solutions. These solutions will bring greater alignment between stakeholders on the utility of plastic in society and a more equitable end-of-life, where environmental and social justice are integrated in the full cost of plastic. The bridge between the linear and circular economy is about material circularity coupled with a sincere investment in common decency and democracy, and corporate responsibility toward those ends, what Severyn Bruyn calls a Civil Economy, whereby government, business, nonprofits and civic groups âcan develop an accountable, self-regulating, profitable, humane, and competitive system of marketsâ [119] (Bruyn 2000). This a thoughtful approach that considers the chemistry of materials, the design of products, the processes required to make things, and finally the systems that manage how materials flow back into the production chain, all in the context of causing no harm to people and the environment, benign by design in its totality.

364,216,0.278,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Likewise in Malaysia land use changes occur due to expansion of palm oil production, and the changes exacerbate crises already caused by deforestation, ecosystem degradation, and biodiversity loss. The country currently faces serious issues involving the trade-off between oil-palm growth and maintenance of ecosystem services. Furthermore, many ecological risks have emerged in the agricultural sector, such as water supply shortages, soil erosion and fertility loss, water-logging effects, salinity, and mangrove conversion. In order to manage these ecological risks, the country instituted a range of legal and regulatory measures such as the National Environmental Policy, the National Conservation Strategy, the National Policy on Biological Diversity, and the Environmental Quality Act. In the Philippines, human-induced ecological risks occur due to land use changes in wetlands. Wetlands are important for both humans and birds. Although particular areas are set aside as bird sanctuaries by local governments with cooperation from local communities, there is growing pressure for cultivated wetland areas to meet the increasing needs of humans for food and fiber. To increase food production in cultivated areas more water is required, and this aggravates water pollution and soil erosion, while reducing carbon sequestration. Consequently, the pressure on cultivated areas reduces the level of ecosystem services. Like other countries, the Philippines is trying to balance agricultural production with supply of ecosystem services, but efforts to do so are affected by typhoons, drought, floods, and social unrest. To address the issues of ecological risks, the country has introduced a wide range of environmental laws and policies on land use management and agrarian reforms, with greater priority placed on community-based management. However, policies related to national land use are not on the agenda and this has caused confusion and conflicts on the part of implementing agencies and authorities. Recent expansion of bio-energy production, which has occurred indiscriminately and on a major scale, has resulted in new environmental obstacles, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Typically, the expansion of oil palm, coffee, or banana plantations has caused massive deforestation and a loss of biodiversity that could include precious genetic resources found only in tropical Asia. Ironically, CO2 emission in plantation crops occurs at a considerably higher rate than in the conventional crops and grains. Goda et al. (2006) have listed a number of negative externalities that ultimately result from human activities such as degradation, livestock production, and use of pesticides in agriculture. Due to population growth and rapid economic development, many Asian countries have increased agricultural food production. However, these human activities have resulted in extensive degradation of natural resources and the reduction of ecosystem services. In particular, the adoption of modern technology including intensive use of fertilizers and monoculture has caused serious soil and water degradation. For example, substantial soil degradation has resulted from deforestation (30 %), overcultivation (32 %), and overgrazing (26 %) occurring due to population growth and economic development in the Asian region. In Japan, the decrease in farmland area has caused various social problems. Due to both rapid urbanization and abandonment of farmland, ecosystem services from farmlands have been lost, resulting in more frequent occurrences of flooding in the"

There are three areas that need to be considered. First, the misconception that some zoned and protected coastal wetlands do not require intervention to sustain or reinstate functional drivers needs to be addressed. This is particularly relevant during regulation and assessment of rehabilitation works and mosquito control activities. Second, codes need to take account of ecosystem functions with emphasis on hydrology and sedimentation in the wetland. Third, planning needs to trigger appropriate"

320,517,0.278,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"20.6.3 Definition of Acceptable Change In the long run, climate change will change distributions of species as well as the composition of habitats (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). It is unlikely that all specific conservation goals can be achieved with such grave environmental changes. In the future, we might be confronted with the need to balance near-term goals for the protection of species and habitats with more long-term goals for sustaining ecological systems and functions that are more likely to persist under changed climate conditions (Glick et al. 2011b). However, we might also find that not every change in species distribution or habitat composition is a reason for concern. In HABIT-CHANGE we have seen many changes that just accelerate natural succession. More research and open discussions will be necessary to answer the question as to which changes in habitats can be tolerated and which habitats should be preserved in their current state. It would be useful to define the limits for acceptable changes for each habitat type. Nevertheless, some species and systems may only be conserved through intensive interventions (Heller and Zavaletta 2009). If no actions are capable of achieving the stated objective, it may even be necessary to adapt and revise objectives (Cross et al. 2012). Letting go of existing objectives and negotiating new aims will be a painful process for many conservationists. Furthermore, there is the risk that arguments involving climatic changes and reformulation of goals might be used to compromise years of protection efforts and achievements. Climate change must not be used as an excuse to limit conservation efforts or inefficient protection. To be prepared for this discussion a proactive conservation management should have answers ready on when, how much, and in what ways conservation management must be adapted (Glick et al. 2011b). Limits on acceptable change might help to identify thresholds related to when and where strategies could change from conserving the current state, to accommodating changes, to initiating transformation of habitats (Morecroft et al. 2012)."

231,795,0.278,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, being widely distributed, common and harvested both in the wild and in aquaculture is probably the most intensively studied marine ï¬sh species. Growth of cod has been shown to depend, among other factors, on food supply and temperature (Bjornsson et al. 2001). When food is not limited, the temperature producing the highest growth rate varies from >12 Â°C for juvenile ï¬sh (body mass <100 g) to <7 Â°C for adult ï¬sh (body mass <5000 g) (Brander 2010). This pattern of change in optimal temperature for growth with body size is due to changing metabolic constraints and means that the same change in temperature can cause both a reduction in growth rate of one life history stage and an increase in another. When food is limited, optimal growth occurs at lower temperatures. Changes in phenology and growth are linked. Seasonal variations in otolith zone formation have been used to show how changes in temperature in the southern North Sea from 1985 to 2004 affected both phenology and growth of cod. Translucent otolith zones occur up to 22 days earlier in warm than in cold years and appear to be indicative of the onset of metabolic stress that results in slower growth"

175,45,0.277,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Environmentalists and some homeowners value wetlands because they help reduce water pollution and floods, as well as nurture a diverse wildlife population. But many landowners and developers see the open wetlands as prime territory for building houses and businesses, rather than for breeding mosquitoes. They view existing federal wetland rules as onerous, illogical, and expensive. While some areas such as Tiger Point have residents who want stricter laws to limit wetlands development, othersâsuch as the suburbs around Seattleâhave people who long for less strict rules. Federal regulators had tried to quell the controversy with a solution known as wetlands mitigation. Anyone who destroys a wetland is required to build or expand another wetland somewhere else. Landowners and developers also see mitigation as a way out of the torturous arguments over wetlands. However, studies have shown many artiï¬cial marshes do not perform as well as those created by nature (NRC 2001). Many of the new, artiï¬cial wetlands are what scientists call the âring around the pondâ variety: open water surrounded by cattails. Furthermore, the federal agency issuing permits for wetland replacement do not have the resources to monitor them after they are approved. Developers know this."

All of the transboundary areaâs groups now own ï¬rearms, so both the incidence and level of violence level of raiding are extreme in certain localities, particularly those that are indicated in Fig. 5.3. Kenyan and Ethiopian security forces in the region impede some of this violence, but the general trend persistsâin fact, escalates, since it stems from the desperate living conditions of all three groups. The effects of this conflict are devastating for all concerned. â¢ Stock mortality with radical herd decline initiated a major exit of northern villagers toward Lake Turkana. Most household heads in the upland plains region knew of at least one or two nearby villages whose residents had already departed for the lake. A few said that they too were considering moving in that direction, as well. (Some village heads indicated that they might instead move to a town in order to increase their chances of receiving food aid.) â¢ Food and other essentials available in local markets are priced beyond the reach of most householdsâeven those fortunate enough to generate income from household/village based commodity production. â¢ Internal social problems accompanying such economic stress are also on the increase. Many elders flatly state that they no longer have authority over the actions of their young men and that such problems are a radical departure from earlier times. The decline of customary traditional authority relations most likely results from a combination of influences including government administrative systems imposed on the Turkana, economic disenfranchisement and displacement of communities, access to weapons (providing young Turkana men with a new sense of power and independence), and privatization of Turkana lands and resource âcommonsâ."

These processes, explained in part by political ecology, are categorized as root causes, dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions, as shown in Fig. 11.2, and are based on physical, political, economic and social environments and variables.

This is due, in part, to the restricted regional distribution of this wetland type in the GoM and the fact that mangroves are almost always contiguous to other vegetated wetlands (e.g., seagrasses and tidal marshes) where benthic assemblages are somewhat less complicated to sample (i.e., woody structures such as prop roots and pneumatophores associated with mangroves make sampling the benthos more difficult; see Lee 2008). The numerically dominant benthic invertebrates in mangrove systems of the GoM are small crustaceans (e.g., amphipods and tanaidaceans) and polychaetes, which may occur at high densities (e.g., >52,000 individuals/m2) but low biomass (e.g., 8.2 g wet/m2) and diversity when compared to seagrass (e.g., 24,000 individuals/m2 and 87.4 g wet/m2) or even shallow unvegetated habitats (Sheridan 1997; Escobar-Briones and Winfield 2003). Most studies of mangrove invertebrate assemblages in the GoM have been conducted in southern Florida (e.g., Sheridan 1992, 1997; Vose and Bell 1994) and Mexico (e.g., VegaCendejas and ArreguÄ±Ìn-SaÌnchez 2001; Lango-Reynoso et al. 2013). Much of this work has focused on the value of mangrove habitat as foraging areas and nurseries for marine and estuarine nekton (Faunce and Serafy 2006). Unlike other coastal wetland habitats in the GoM, the role of mangroves as important nurseries for nektonic fishes and decapod crustaceans appears to be equivocal (Barbier and Strand 1998; Sheridan and Hays 2003). Detritus has long been considered the base of mangrove food webs (Odum and Heald 1972) and that notion has persisted in more recent studies of trophic structure and dynamics in GoM mangrove systems, especially in Mexico (Rosado-Solorzano and GuzmaÌn del Proo 1998; VegaCendejas and ArreguÄ±Ìn-SaÌnchez 2001; Rivera-Arriaga et al. 2003). Mangrove leaf detritus is more refractory than seagrass or marsh plant detritus and alternative perspectives on the base of GoM mangrove food webs have also emerged, placing emphasis on the importance of benthic algae and phytoplankton (Dittel et al. 1997) or detritus from other sources of riparian vegetation (Mendoza-Carranza et al. 2010). Regardless of the source of detritus or primary"

36,203,0.277,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"5.4.5 Plantations There is no internationally agreed definition of forest plantation and many very old forests we may think of as natural have been planted. However, for the purposes of this review, the term plantation is used to mean forests planted primarily for timber extraction using intensive management techniques. Timber plantations are perhaps the most extreme form of silviculture as they require replanting of typically exotic trees, with site and soil preparation required over large scales. Seedlings are planted at high densities to maximise growth and form of trees, and this has the consequence of producing high levels of clutter as the trees grow. All the silvicultural practices outlined in this section are also applicable to plantation forests. The response of bats has been documented in eucalypt plantations in Australia and pine plantations in New Zealand. As expected, bat activity in young plantations of eucalypts (<10 years) is typically low and considerably less than that found in nearby forest, and, somewhat surprisingly, activity is similar to levels over adjacent cleared farms (Law and Chidel 2006; Law et al. 2011). Bat activity is higher in older eucalypt plantations (~25 years), especially where drought and lack of maintenance leads to tree mortality and the creation of gaps (Law and Chidel 2006). Closed-space species (Nyctophilus) show some association with plantations as do open-space species (Mormopterus ridei), which presumably use the space above plantations together with adjacent open paddocks. Radio-tracked bats avoid roosting in young eucalypt plantations where tree hollows are absent, even though decorticating bark is present (Law et al. 2011). Despite limitations in habitat quality, plantation forests provide large areas of additional habitat for threatened long-tailed bats, Chalinolobus tuberculatus, in New Zealand (Borkin and Parsons 2011a). Borkin and Parsons (2011b) found these bats roosting in crevices, fissures, and small hollows in the oldest stands of Monterey pine, Pinus radiata, plantations (25â30 years), with females choosing to roost within 150 m of waterways. In these plantations, bats selected home ranges with higher proportions of relatively old stands than available (Borkin and Parsons 2011a). Males selected edges with open unplanted areas within their home ranges, which females avoided, instead selecting older stands for foraging. Borkin et al. (2011) also documented the response to the clear-fell harvest of a pine plantation and found a pattern of declining numbers of roosts used, as well as smaller roosting areas and colony sizes. Over 3 years, 21 % of known roosts were lost with 15 % due to forestry operations and 6 % due to natural tree fall. To mitigate harvest operations, it was suggested that some suitable foraging and roosting areas should be retained within bat home ranges. Borkin et al. (2011) further suggested that priority management for this declining New Zealand bat should focus on"
182,306,0.277,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"that twenty-first-century challenges of global food security and zoonotic diseases meant that âthe continuing convergence of animal health, human health, and ecosystem health is the new realityâ, which must be responded to with a âOne World, One Health, One Medicineâ approach. Mahr argued that veterinarians should adopt OH. Through building partnerships with public and environmental health professionals, they should assume leading roles in meeting these challengesâand growing the profession along the way.64 Over the following year, he gained the support of his counterpart at the American Medical Association (AMA), public health physician Ronald M. Davis, who had pre-existing concerns about the risks that zoonotic diseases pose to humans. While this alliance resulted in OH being endorsed by the AMA in 2007, Davis died of cancer the following year and the resolution was subsequently dropped, indicating that the US medical profession more widely did not share his enthusiasm for OH.65 Mahr was more successful in persuading his colleagues in the AVMA, who passed their own resolution supporting OH. They also established a One Health Commission to investigate ways of improving veterinarymedical collaborations and moving the agenda forward, chaired by Lonnie King, one of the 2002 Schwabe symposium contributors. In parallel, Laura Kahn, Thomas Monath and Bruce Kaplan formed the One Health Initiative, an unfunded advocacy group dedicated to making the case for OH. Kahn is a physician based at Princeton University who by 2006 was already working on biosecurity and the risks of pandemic disease.66 Kaplan had worked on food-borne illnesses for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before his retirement, and Monath is a physician and consultant working in the pharmaceutical industry.67 The OH Initiative quickly launched a website and organized a series of meetings and publications on OH/OM, including a piece entitled âConfronting Zoonosesâ co-authored by Kahn and Kaplan with veterinary public health pioneer James H.

These transformations include biological processes (formation and degradation of biomass in the widest sense) and physicochemical processes (particle formation, sedimentation, burial and gas exchange) leading to an overall retention of biogenic elements (Behrendt and Opitz 1999; Kortelainen et al. 2004, 2006b; Venohr et al. 2005), and only a proportion of the nutrients originally released from the natural and human sources will ï¬nally reach the Baltic Sea. The human drivers (Sect. 17.2.3.1) and climate drivers (Sect. 17.2.3.2) will influence the sources and transformations in different ways. Atmospheric deposition, forestry and eutrophication will clearly influence point and diffuse sources of biogenic elements, whereas these human drivers will have both positive and negative feedbacks on transformation processes and retention. Damming and other hydrological alterations including ditching as part of forestry and wetland management will directly affect water residence times in watersheds, which is a major variable determining the total period over which transformation processes can occur during passage from land to the Baltic Sea and is positively linked to the retention of biogenic elements (Valett et al. 1996; Behrendt and Opitz 1999; SÃ¸ndergaard 2007). Temperature will affect weathering processes, N ï¬xation rates, terrestrial primary production and the overall kinetics of transformation processes, while an increase in precipitation will increase weathering up to a certain threshold (Kump et al. 2000) and increase nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea, that is decrease the time available for transformation processes and retention (Hong et al. 2012)."

314,229,0.276,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Assessing the vulnerability of communities to climate shocks is important in identifying and characterizing actions toward strengthening resilience (Kelly and Adger 2000; Islam et al. 2014). Yet, existing literature suggests that individuals and communities that depend on highly climate-sensitive sector such as agriculture are vulnerable and less resilient to climate shocks. The existing literature is related to fishery systems (e.g., Islam et al. 2014), agricultural livelihoods (e.g., Brooks et al. 2005; Vincent 2007; Shewmake 2008; Deressa et al. 2008, 2009; Tesso et al. 2012; Etwire et al. 2013; Simane et al. 2016), and many sectors of the economy (e.g., Dixon et al. 2003; Dunford et al. 2015). However, to date none of them investigated quantitatively the extent to which land tenure affects vulnerability to climate shocks. Vulnerability of communities to climate shocks is the propensity or predisposition they are to be adversely affected (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1775). The three components of vulnerability are exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of the communities. Exposure has an external dimension, while sensitivity, and adaptive capacity have an internal dimension (FÃ¼ssel 2007). Exposure is the presence of communities in places and settings that could be adversely affected (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1765). Sensitivity refers to the degree to which communities are affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate shocks (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1772). As for adaptive capacity, it is the ability of communities to adjust to climate shocks, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1758). Adaptive capacity encompasses five types of capital: physical, financial, human, natural, and social capital (Scoones 1998). As mentioned above, resilience is becoming influential in development economics. Resilience is the capacity of communities to cope with climate shocks, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation (adapted from IPCC 2014, p. 1772). Vulnerability and resilience are related concepts (Turner 2010). Resilience influences adaptive capacity (Klein et al. 2003; Adger 2006). Both vulnerability and resilience recognize adaptive capacity, so they"
326,146,0.276,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","matters what kind of vehicle we would crash into (e. g., is it a compact car or SUV?), how heavy incoming traffic is (e. g., would more than one vehicle be involved?), how many persons may be involved (e. g., are there children in the other car?). Of course, here we are assuming perfect sensing and V2X communications that can help answer these questions. If we cannot answer the questions, then we face a possibly large unknown risk, which makes driving into incoming traffic perhaps the worst option available. Other factors relevant to the decision-points above include: the road-shoulder type (paved, gravel, none, etc.), the condition of the carâs tires and brakes, whether the carâs occupants are seat-belted, whether the car is transporting dangerous cargo that could spill or explode, proximity to hospital or emergency rescue, damage to property such as houses and buildings, and more. These variables influence the probability of an accident as well as expected harm, both of which are needed in selecting the best course of action. From this short analysis of a typical crash (or possible crash) with an animal, we can already see a daunting number of factors to account for. Sensing technologies today cannot answer some or many of the questions above, but it is already unclear that braking should be the safest default option â as a proxy for the most ethical option â given these uncertain conditions, all things considered. Automated cars today can already detect whether there is oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. Therefore, it is at least possible that they can be programmed to maneuver slightly into the incoming lane under some conditions, e. g., when there are no incoming cars and when it may be dangerous to slam on the brakes. Whether or not sensing technologies will improve enough to deliver answers to our questions above, a programmer or OEM would still need to assign costs or weights to various actions and objects as best as they can. Yet these values are not intrinsic to or discoverable by science or engineering. Values are something that we humans must stipulate and ideally agree upon. In constructing algorithms to control an autonomous car, ethics is already implied in the design process. Any decision that involves a tradeoff such as to strike object x instead of object y requires a value-judgment about the wisdom of the tradeoff, that is, the relative weights of x and y. And the design process can be made better by recognizing the ethical implications and by engaging the broader community to ensure that those values are represented correctly or at least transparently. Working in a moral bubble is less likely to deliver results that are acceptable to society. Again, in a real-world accident today, a human driver usually has neither the time nor the information needed to make the most ethical or least harmful decisions. A person who is startled by a small animal on an otherwise uneventful drive may very well react poorly. He might drive into oncoming traffic and kill a family, or oversteer into a ditch and to his own death. Neither of these results, however, is likely to lead to criminal prosecution by themselves, since there was no forethought, malice, negligence, or bad intent in making a forced, split-second reaction. But the programmer and OEM do not operate under the sanctuary of reasonable instincts; they make potentially life-and-death decisions under no truly urgent time-constraint and therefore incur the responsibility of making better decisions than human drivers reacting reflexively in surprise situations."

When a cyclone makes landfall in the Sundarbans, the mangroves act as a buffer which reduces the extent of land inundation (see Sakib et al. 2015). Another study shows that due to net land subsidence, cyclone landfall in the central region is more vulnerable compared to other regions (Nihal et al. 2015)."
231,1171,0.276,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Alheit et al. (2012), the anchovy population from the western Channel (not from the Bay of Biscay) invaded the North Sea and Baltic Sea during positive periods of the AMO. Given this evidence and according to the rules of ârelative stabilityâ within the EU Common Fisheries Policy, Spanish and French vessels would not necessarily be granted exclusive access to this expanding resource, unlike the present situation in the Bay of Biscay. Under the EU Common Fisheries Policy, a number of closed areas have been implemented as âtechnical measuresâ to conserve particular species and to protect nursery or spawning grounds. In the North Sea, these include closure areas to protect plaice, herring, Norway pout and sandeel. If species shift their distribution in response to climate change then it is possible that such measures will become less effective in the future (van Keeken et al. 2007). Juvenile plaice are typically concentrated in shallow inshore waters of the southeast North Sea and move gradually offshore as they grow. In order to reduce discarding of undersized plaice, thereby decreasing mortality and enhancing recruitment to the ï¬shery, the EU âPlaice Boxâ was introduced in 1989, excluding access to beam and otter trawlers larger than 300 hp. However recent surveys in the Wadden Sea have shown that 1-group plaice are now completely absent from the area where they were once very abundant. Consequently, the âPlaice Boxâ is now less effective as a management measure for plaice than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The boundaries of, and expected beneï¬ts from marine protected areas (MPAs) may need to be âadaptiveâ in the future in the context of climate change. Cheung et al. (2012) looked at other ï¬shery closure areas in the North Sea and noted that they will most likely experience between 2 and 3 Â°C increases in temperature over the next 80â100 years and consequently it is unlikely that the species they are designed to protect now will occur there in the same numbers in the future given deï¬ned temperature tolerances or preferences of speciï¬c ï¬shes (Freitas et al. 2007; PÃ¶rtner and Peck 2010). Fishers have witnessed and responded to a number of new opportunities in recent years, as warm-water species have moved into the North Sea and/or their exploitation has become commercially viable for the ï¬rst time. Notable examples include new or expanding ï¬sheries for seabass, red mullet, John dory Zeus faber, anchovy and squid Loligo forbesi. Biomass estimates for seabass in the eastern Channel quadrupled from around 500 tonnes in 1985, to in excess of 2100 tonnes in 2004/2005, with populations also increasing rapidly in the southern North Sea (Pawson et al. 2007). This was attributed to an increase in seawater temperature, especially in the winter and has resulted in a dramatic expansion of seabass ï¬sheries both within the commercial sector and the recreational ï¬shing sector. Seabass are caught by angling on the east coast of Scotland and in Norway, but"

241,373,0.276,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"5.3.2.1 Estonia Reihan et al. (2007) analysed 14 daily streamflow records ranging in length from 45 to 98 years for the period 1903â 2004. The tendency for a decrease in spring floods was notable in all periods for 80 % of stations over the continental regions. No trend was detected in spring, summer and autumn run-off, nor in summer droughts. Long-term discharge trends were analysed by the Estonian Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (EMHI 2011) for the period 1957â2006 for 23 Estonian gauges. Trends were investigated by applying the MannâKendall test with a 5 % signiï¬cance level. Annual mean run-off shows a signiï¬cant positive trend over all Estonia except for the Narva river. The changes in annual run-off follow the changes in precipitation. Spring flood maximum discharge shows a signiï¬cant negative trend over Estonia, while winter flood maximum discharge shows a signiï¬cant positive trend over the country. Summer flood maximum discharge has increased in eastern Estonia, while a decrease has occurred in central and western parts of the country. 5.3.2.2 Finland The published data on water level and flow regimes in the rivers of Finland extend until 2004 (Korhonen 2007; Korhonen and Kuusisto 2010). The monthly and annual mean outflow from the whole territory has been determined for the period 1912â2004, complemented by 25 discharge time series and 13 water level time series. Both unregulated and regulated rivers were examined. While most of the observation series examined started from the 1910s to 1930s, the longest continuous records date back to the mid-1800s. The mean outflow from Finland in 1912â2004 was about 3300 mâ3 sâ1 (Fig. 5.10). The variation in annual mean discharge was 18 %. The lowest annual outflow from"
389,383,0.276,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"A meta-analysis of the relevant literature revealed that radiocesium concentrations in fish were a positive function of contamination concentrations in the water, particularly for nonpiscivorous fish species (Rowan and Rasmussen 1994). Although direct radiocesium transfer from water to fish muscle tissue seems to be negligible, water may act as a radiocesium source to planktivorous fish via the food chain (Elliott et al. 1992; Rask et al. 2012; Tuovinen et al. 2013). In many Japanese lakes and rivers, including the Lake Chuzenji system, the release of hatchery-reared fish enhances resources and supplements wild fish stocks, which are essential components of successful freshwater fisheries management programs (Kitada 2001; Yamamoto et al. 2011). Continued monitoring of radiocesium concentrations in water and zooplankton, as well as in fish, is crucial for estimating bioconcentration and bioaccumulation and, thus, for predicting contamination concentrations in released hatchery-reared fish within the affected area."
347,291,0.276,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"how to safely perform ballast water exchange before entering the Baltic Sea, as well as provide guidance on how to perform risk assessments and monitoring. Various research projects and databases have been initiated at the European and Baltic Sea level to compile inventories of IAS, as well as identify species and shipping practices connected with particularly high levels of environmental risks (HELCOM 2014; Smolarz et al. 2016). Hence, both management and assessment activities linked to IAS risks in the Baltic Sea are, despite some recent progress, still in need of further development, particularly in order to reach the ambitious objective set by HELCOM in the 2007 Baltic Sea Action Plan of no introduction of IAS from ships. For example, observations of new IAS often still build on incidental reporting, since targeted and coordinated monitoring is often lacking in high-risk areas. In a wider perspective, it has also been argued that management and science support needs to be improved for ânon-shippingâ sources of IAS such as aquaculture and that interdependence with other environmental issues such as fisheries, human-induced climate change and eutrophication need to be considered in risk assessments (Smolarz et al. 2016). Wide stakeholder involvement at the science-policy interface is lacking in the case of IAS. For most stakeholders and the general public, this seems to be due to a widespread lack of interest in the IAS issue and its management, which are seen as rather uncontroversial and straightforward. In contrast, stakeholders associated with the shipping and cargo sector have shown a strong interest in contributing knowledge and opinions as part of negotiations on development and implementation of regulations (Lemke et al. 2010). Negotiations leading up to the 2004 opening of the BWM Convention have been described by IMO as âcomplexâ. The subsequent rather long ratification process seems to have been influenced by discussions on, for example, technical possibilities and costs of ballast water management. It therefore remains to be seen whether or not these sector-based discussions will improve efficiency and effectiveness of IAS-related management in the Baltic Sea."

Relying on the most comprehensive literature review to date, corresponding to 58 worldwide conï¬ict cases (drawing on the WRM database), Gerber (2011) ï¬nds that the prominent cause of resistance is related to corporate control over land that results in displacements and the end of local uses of ecosystems as they are replaced by monocultures. Biomass conï¬icts related to ï¬sheries and shrimp aquaculture are also relevant in Latin America. Let us brieï¬y consider here the environmental injustices related to the promotion of the shrimp aquaculture industry in Central America, in the Gulf of Fonseca region of Nicaragua and Honduras on the Paciï¬c Coast. This is one of the most densely populated areas in Central America and also one of the poorest. This regional economy depends, to a large extent, on artisanal ï¬shing, speciï¬cally shellï¬sh harvesting. Industrial aquaculture activities began in Honduras at the start of the 1970s and in Nicaragua in the second half of the 1980s with small-scale projects. Nowadays this activity has sharply increased. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2008 production had reached 26,584 tonnes, and 14,690 tonnes in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively. This implies an increase in total production of more than 200% in both countries over ten years (1998â2008). Most of the production is for export, mainly to the USA and to European markets. Where there were once estuaries and natural lagoons, nowadays there are large ponds for producing shrimp. In Nicaragua the surface area under production expanded from 771 Ha in 1989 to 10,396 Ha in 2009, and in Honduras from 750 Ha in 1985 to 14,954 Ha in 2000 (Mestre Montserrat and Ortega CerdÃ , 2012). What was supposed to become a source of wealth for the regional economy has disempowered local ï¬shing communities, which have seen their access to natural resources enclosed and limited. This has triggered serious social conï¬icts in the region. The industrial sites are located in areas populated by poor communities that rely on the communal use of coastal resources. The main response of the shrimp industry to the theft of their product has been the armed surveillance of their lands, both private and public. This has been a common practice in Nicaragua since 2008, when an agreement was established between the Association of Aquaculturalists of Nicaragua and the armed forces. These measures have further limited the access of local communities to coastal resources, fostering conï¬ict and further impoverishing the population, thereby increasing social marginalization and unrest.

Ulrich Beck has proposed the concept of ârisk societyâ to describe modern societies. However, this idea has sparked debates. The first concerns modernity. What Europe experienced during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries took place in two generations in some Asian countries. Kyung-Sup Chang (2010) has proposed the concept of âcompressed modernityâ to account for this phenomenon. The second concerns the concept of risk itself, which, in the field of food, is charged with reducing the problem to its health-related dimensions. In the last three decades, the West has faced several big food crises, especially that of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

This must lead to catastrophic consequences, constraining humanityâs ability to make further demands on ecosystems and ultimately rebalancing environmental impact with natureâs ability to provide ecosystem services (Fig. 4.3). Environmental neo-Malthusianism is neatly illustrated by ecological footprint analysis, as in the World Wildlife Fundâs Living Planet Report (WWF 2012).2 The report closely follows the neo-Malthusian template, with ecological footprint outpacing and straining biocapacity but ultimately constrained by it. Ecological footprint (Æ1) is a measure of environmental impact. It is understood as the land base that would be required to compensate for a given level of environmental impact, most notably greenhouse gas emissions. It is based on the so-called IPAT equation, which specifies environmental impact in terms of population, affluence, and technology (Ehrlich and Holdren 1971). The equation has seen many specifications over the years (Chertow 2000).3 To cite just one prominent example, Ehrlich et al. (1999, 270) define environmental impact (I) as: a product of population size (P), per capita affluence (A) measured as per capita consumption, and the environmental impact of the technologies, cultural practices, and institutions through which that consumption is serviced (T), measured as damage per unit of consumption."

Over the period 1985 to 2006, species richness increased from around 60 species to almost 90 and the increase is positively related to the increase in sea-bottom temperature (SBT) during that quarter, which rose by an average of 0.7 Â°C decadeâ1 (Fig. 8.7). The increase in species richness is consistent with both the earlier observation that rate of advance of leading edges of distributions is more rapid than the retreat of trailing edges and with the generally higher species richness of warmer areas. The apparent persistence of cool-temperate species during the Mesolithic warm period suggests that the effect is not just a transient one.

Random effect models provide an unconditional inference of a larger set of studies from which only a few are included in the meta-analysis and assumed to be a random sample (Viechtbauer 2010). We compared both models based on the reported effect size and assessed the proportion of heterogeneity of bat responses between high and intermediate urban development (Ï2 highly urban- Ï2 small urban/Ï2 highly urban). In a second approach, we pooled data from high and intermediate urbanisation categories to investigate if the potential of bats to adjust to urban environments is determined by phylogeny or rather functional ecology using a mixed model metaanalysis. For this analysis we classified bats according to their taxonomic family and genus, their predominant food item (fruits, nectar and insects), foraging mode (aerial, gleaning) and foraging space (narrow, edge and open, following Schnitzler and Kalko (2001)) and included these classifications as moderators in our mixed model meta-analysis. We further investigated in detail how each of the categorical moderators influences effect size. Further, focusing on aerial insectivores, the majority of study cases in our dataset, we then investigated if moderators influencing the adaptability to urban areas are consistent between North and South America versus Europe, Asia and Australia. P-levels for all models were assessed using a permutation test with 1000 randomizations.

35,273,0.276,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"(see examples given in Barrett et al. 2002; Bunting 2004; FrÃ¶cklin et al. 2012; Isaksen and Mikkelsen 2012; Jentoft and Chuenpagdee 2013; Sandberg 2003; Sievanen et al. 2005; Varela 2001). In many cases the omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Martinez-Alier 2001; Nagarajan and Thiyageasan 2006; Varela 2001). The unavoidability of feedbacks between largely structural and technical interventions and the socio-economic systems within which they are embedded, highlights the need for employing more systematic (or ecosystem) approaches to analyse cause and effect relationships and to explore future sustainable, efï¬cient and equitable development scenarios (Hopkins et al. 2011; Belton and Bush 2014). This raises the question, what processes are needed to include issues and concerns that are not currently promoted by active and resourceful stakeholders (Buanes et al. 2004). This is especially important in offshore areas under multi-use conditions, since this is a novel line of resource use which lacks yet experiences on which stakeholder groupâs work well together under which governance and management conditions and what type of socio-economic outcomes can be expected. Indeed, more detailed and context-speciï¬c socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture operations include many important factors which need to be understood: gender, employment and income, nutrition, food security, health, insurance, credit availability, human rights, legal security, privatization, culture/identity, global trade and inequalities, as well as policies, laws and regulations, macro-economic context, political context, customary rules and systems, stakeholders, knowledge and attitudes, ethics, power, markets, capital and ownership (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Certainly, the lack of consensus on the social dimension is striking when compared with the universally accepted general deï¬nitions that exist for the biological and economic dimensions for sustainable ecosystem management (Krause et al. 2015). This is even more so the case of offshore marine management. Based on the existing literature from coastal aquaculture (see references below) we identify these major types of socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture which are universally applicable: (a) Attitudes to and perceptions of aquaculture and its effects (b) Organization of and participation in planning for aquaculture (c) Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution (d) Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests (e) Effects on the wider economic and innovation system (f) Effects on cultural fabric and other social aspects As the list indicates, the social implications of aquaculture are multi-dimensional and affect multiple levels. As a starting point of this analysis, we capture what we account as social dimension by stating what aspects of aquaculture we have excluded: The internal organization and efï¬ciency of the aquaculture production units, and the ecological effects of aquaculture production (including biological,"

India held 250,000 million or a quarter of all cattle and water buffaloes in the world, but the average annual yield per milk animal was only 200 kg compared with 4000 kg in the Netherlands.67 Whereas the average annual yield of an American beef cow was 75.6 kg, in Asia the figure was less than 12 kg. These unproductive bovine bodies caused particular alarm owing to unprecedented (and unexpected) population growth in the far East, Africa and Latin America. Population experts predicted an impending collapse as human numbers outstripped food supplies. The fAOâs first World Food Survey in 1946 estimated that two-thirds of the worldâs human population were hungry. Their findings added the threat of starvation to the persistent problem of malnutrition.68 As the Cold War set in and decolonization began, fears grew that hungry people would join disaffected rebel groups or turn to communism.69 In this context, cows were not only crucial sources of food but also political actors capable of influencing global security. As the fAOâs first director, Orr responded by attempting to implement earlier ideas of a marriage of food and agriculture.70 He sought to create a World food Board, which would centrally organize world food production according to actual needs rather than the market, with the ultimate aim of ensuring food as a basic human right. This radical vision never materialized, largely because of resistance from major agricultural powers. Instead it developed into a system for donating, disposing of or trading agricultural surpluses from the developed to the underdeveloped world through mechanisms such as the fAOâs World food Programme, the USA food for Peace Programme, and the United Nations Childrenâs fund (UNICEfâs) child healthâmilk initiatives.71 On taking control in"

Both Vereshchaka and Vinogradov (1999) and Skebo et al. (2006) used in situ visual observations, which should have allowed them to gather information on the fragile ctenophores and larvaceans. However, although the former authors showed that gelatinous animals and radiolarians can dominate plankton biomass throughout the water column, particularly just above and below the main core of the hydrothermal vent plume, at the Broken Spur vent field, mid-Atlantic ridge, and the latter authors also found significant differences in jellyfish abundances between the near-field and far-field areas, the level of taxonomic resolution was only at the Phylum level. The midwater and benthopelagic fauna occurring around deep sea chemosynthetic ecosystems is therefore somewhat of a black box, even though the predation pressure on vent-derived larvae exerted by its inhabitants may be considerable. The taxonomy of these soft-bodied predators is difficult and the information needed to correctly identify many of the species is scattered throughout the literature in a variety of languages. In the present paper we analysed the video record from ten dives of the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) HyperDolphin around the Hatoma Knoll hydrothermal vent site (approx. 21 51.450 N 123 50.450 E) and give taxonomic treatments and other information on the gelatinous zooplankton that were observed, in order to stimulate and facilitate further work. As it is not yet known at what depths the larvae of each vent species inhabit during development, we give a synopsis of the gelatinous zooplankton that could eat released eggs and newly-hatched larvae (eg. larvaceans, lobate ctenophores) as well as those that would be expected to prey on larvae nearing their settlement phase (eg. siphonophores and cydippid ctenophores), and their potential predators, in turn. Where a video record existed, it was analyzed from the benthopelagic layers near the vent plumes right up to the near surface layer."
97,458,0.275,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Governments are increasingly searching for cost-effective and holistic ways of addressing environmental challenges, which not only reliably deliver their immediate intended impacts, such as space for recreation and reduced air pollution, but also bring additional benefits to society, such as improved health and well-being. Policymakers in cities and at the sub-national level can lead the way in making the transition towards increasing resilience and integrating ecological concerns within urban planning and decision-making. Instead of an infrastructure agenda in which nature is a problem, a cost, and a political risk, nature can become part of the solution. Cities around Europe have already shown a commitment to integrating nature into their urban planning and management, and thereby demonstrated awareness of the importance of protecting natural capital. The Regional Climate Plan for Paris, for example, highlights the importance of protecting ecosystems in order to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Conseil Regional DâÃle-De-France 2011). The city also recognises that forest management practices which optimise their capacity for adaptation and resilience can lead to multiple benefits for biodiversity, people and the city (Natureparif 2015). Additional examples of cities that have integrated nature within their planning and strategies are outlined below."

For example, obtaining yearling animals during favorable times and having somewhere to send these animals as forage conditions deteriorate can present challenges for land managers under a flexible strategy. For more remote areas distant from markets, a flexible strategy can present challenges due to logistical difficulties and costs of transporting animals. Transporting livestock from a property with a forage deficit to another property with a forage surplus (agistment), where the livestock owner leases the land for grazing the livestock, is an important management option in Australia (McAllister et al. 2006). Benefits to the livestock owner can include (1) an avoided forced sale of livestock with depressed prices, (2) a more rapid vegetation recovery following the end of drought by reducing degradation due to drought, and (3) maintaining a core breeding herd. A risk is prolonged drought and the leased property also running out of forage, potentially forcing the eventual sale of the livestock. Agistment is less common outside of Australia, although in the USA there was a substantial movement of cattle from Texas and California to the Northern Great Plains during recent droughts. Nomadism and transhumance are practiced in some African and Asian rangelands as a means of buffering the effects of climate variability, but this mobility is rapidly being lost (Chap. 17, this volume). Provision of supplementary feed as a drought management strategy is problematic in many rangelands because of the conflict between drought policies and economics of purchasing supplemental feed. The cost of purchase and transport of supplemental feed can be considerable, particularly for remote regions and extensive enterprises with large herds or flocks typical of many rangelands, and in the case of multiyear droughts (Kachergis et al. 2014). Maintaining livestock on rangelands by means of supplementary forage can degrade natural resources, including vegetation and soils. Providing supplementary feed can only be justified for maintaining a limited number of animals, such as valuable core breeding stock. For example, placing cows in drylots for calving and breeding may be advantageous for both cow and subsequent calf performance compared to supplementing cows on pastures during these periods, due to controlling rations for protein, energy, and fat content (Wilson et al. 2015). In shrub-dominated rangelands experiencing drought, livestock will increase use of shrubs (Estell et al. 2012)."
284,302,0.275,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"practices, such as collective rules in use and trust, are important for promoting social capital. In general terms, communities with the strongest organization are also those where protection and conservation activities are more frequent and diverse. This pattern reveals the relevance high levels of social organization required to support local coordination and collective action addressing forest protection and conservation activities. A small number of communities, however, perform forest-protection activities at high intensity. This pattern is a possible outcome of government subsidies for reforestation. In contrast, a reduced number of highly organized communities showed very few protection and conservation practices. These cases reveal that communities may be organized for different purposes that do not necessarily coincide with forest conservation. In summary, social organization is an important requirement for performing conservation activities but it is not sufï¬cient for creating incentives to engage in forest protection. Protection and conservation activities are closely related to the development of community forestry. The forest economy tends to be low where local institutions are weak. As a result, limited protection and conservation activities lead to increased pressure on forests. Interestingly, pressure on forests drops considerably according to the increasing importance of commercial forest activity in communities. In cases where recent deforestation took place, forest economy in the communities is weak. In general, communities with lower levels of pressure on forests are those with the most consolidated economic forest activities. This information suggests that as the incentives, knowledge and technical skills increase â as a result of a more diversiï¬ed community forest economy â community members are more able and willing to identify and address pressures on forests before their impacts grow out of control. Communities with the highest level of local forest economy34 tend to have lower institutional strength in comparison to communities with only vertical integration of forest production. The former needs stronger and more diversiï¬ed institutions in order to manage industrial and commercial operations, diversify forest production and carry out multiple activities, such as timber extraction and processing. However, as these data reveal, new economic forest activities may lack the institutional support to scale up their commercial activities. If not properly addressed, these âinstitutional gapsâ can undermine common natural resources used in production processes, collective initiatives and community governance itself."
231,826,0.275,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"There is evidence of recent changes in range expansion for several dolphin species in the North Sea region. One such case is the (common) bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, off the northeast coast of Scotland. Here they are at the northern limit of their distribution. The causes behind this increase in distribution are still unknown, but may be related to changes in abundance and/or distribution of prey (Wilson et al. 2004; Learmonth et al. 2006), which may also be linked to climate change. Another species reported to have exhibited recent range shifts is the white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris; Fig. 8.12). This is a species distributed mainly in cold temperate to Arctic waters. In the North Atlantic they are limited to high latitudes (Evans et al. 2003; MacLeod et al. 2005; Baines et al. 2006; Evans and Smeenk 2008). They are among the most abundant delphinid species in the North Sea in summer; sightings are much rarer during winter. Stranding records have shown a signiï¬cant increase of the species in the southern North Sea since the 1960s. During recent decades they have regularly been detected in the Southern Bight (Bakker and Smeenk 1987; Kinze et al. 1997; Camphuysen and Peet 2006). However, these changes need not be directly related to changes in sea temperature, but may"

77,96,0.275,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"prevailing aetiological model for cardio-metabolic disease of the twentieth century emphasised adulthood risk factors because the diseases normally manifest for the first time in adulthood and are modifiable by lifestyle or environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and smoking. Despite the dominance of the adult lifestyle model, there were a few initial reports suggesting that early life events might have long-term consequences for cardio-metabolic health in adulthood (Forsdahl 1977; Dorner et al. 1973; Dorner 1973; Freinkel 1980; Kermack et al. 2001). The study of Forsdahl (1977), for example, demonstrated a positive correlation between county level CHD mortality in Norway, in people aged between 40 and 69 years of age, and infant mortality 70 years earlier. It was postulated that poverty and food insecurity in childhood and adolescence were risk factors for CHD in adulthood. Finding a similar association between area level infant mortality and CHD mortality in the United Kingdom (UK), Professor David Barker from the University of Southampton hypothesised that environmental factors acting in utero or infancy may have adverse effects on CHD in later life (Barker and Osmond 1986). Direct evidence in support of this hypothesis was provided when Barker et al. (1989), linking individual birth records from the early decades of the twentieth century to subsequent mortality information, observed that the risk of death from CHD was greatest in individuals who were lightest at birth; birth weight being a conveniently available proxy marker of growth and nutrition in utero. A series of epidemiological studies followed seeking to confirm the initial birth weight-CHD association and extend it to include measures of postnatal growth and other health outcomes. The initial foetal origins of adult disease or programming hypothesis thus broadened, to become what is now known as the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) model. The importance of early life does not, however, mean that cardio-metabolic risk is set at the end of infancy and neither does it invalidate other models of disease causation. Indeed, at the same time that the DOHaD paradigm was developing, the term life course epidemiology was coined by scientists who recognised that disease development was more likely a lifelong process. They set out the key principles of this holistic approach in a series of papers and a book (Kuh et al. 2003, 2013; Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Kuh and Ben-Shlomo 2004; Kuh and Hardy 2002; Pickles et al. 2007; Lawlor and Mishra 2009; Koenen et al. 2013). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the role of body size in cardio-metabolic health played a central part in the development of the life course approach. The broad goal of this chapter is to synthesis this literature to better understand the lifelong age-related changes in body size that are indicative of poor cardio-metabolic health and the key environmental exposures and biological pathways responsible. We start with an overview of the life course approach in epidemiology to provide a framework for the review."

284,229,0.275,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction Latin America is home to alarming poverty rates and the greatest inequality gap in the world (ECLAC, 2010). The concentration of wealth has disadvantaged local populations and their needs, while simultaneously driving the degradation and destruction of natural resources. This process has rendered serious implications for climate change (IPCC, 2007; Sandberg and Sandberg, 2010). While economic constraints are perhaps the most important aspect of poverty, they are only one of many that impede the personal development of the population (Cimadamore and Cattani, 2008; Cimadamore and Sejenovich 2010). Latin America accounts for only 8% of the worldâs population, but it is home to a signiï¬cant portion of the planetâs natural resources. This includes 46% of rainforests, 23% of forests and savannahs, 30% of freshwater (from a stable potable source), 30% of permanent crops, 23% of arable land, 17.7% of grassland and 16% of cattle-ranching land (Sejenovich and Panario, 1997). At the same time, as a geographical area it has shown signiï¬cant industrial, infrastructural and ï¬nancial development. This means that it has the potential to improve its productive activities in order to meet the needs of the population. However, there is a signiï¬cant degree of social exclusion and poverty due to systematic disparities in income, possession of resources and power. While the rhythm of productive development has kept momentum, so has the destruction of natural resources and unsustainable use of biodiversity. As a result, the high concentration of monocrops has displaced populations, thereby accelerating the intensiï¬cation of rural and urban poverty alike. Similarly, urban development has not followed environmental principles and has therefore contributed to pollution, habitat degradation"
73,162,0.275,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Both natural and constructed wetlands either fresh or saline are a transition between land and water and may hold surface water on a permanent or periodical basis. Some wetlands are basins that are designed to hold water whilst others may be designed to allow full or partial inï¬ltration and may not be permanent water bodies. All forms of wetlands have a role in water quality improvement as well as being of environmental and social beneï¬t. In all conï¬gurations wetlands can deteriorate and are subject to collapse due to inï¬uents generated by urbanisation. Though litter traps may provide a partial solution for visible pollutants, the main cause of collapse is from the adverse impact of nutrients, silt and toxic substances many of which also include heavy metals. The conclusion that can be drawn is that wetlands should not be used as a dumping ground for urban run-off with an expectation of self remediation. Wetlands should be regarded as a sensitive environment, which needs to be protected from the discharge of contaminants derived from urbanisation."

Based on the existing data from the district office, 62 kampungs (villages) under 11 mukims were identified as flood-affected areas in the Padang Terap district. Once the kampungs and mukims associated with floods were identified, specific flood areas were located with help from ketua kampung (village leaders). The survey was then carried out in the specifically identified flood areas. The survey was distributed to 683 flood victims to obtain their demographic information, to identify vulnerable groups and affected areas, and to identify the needs of the victims before, during, and after a flood occurs. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS Software version 17. The total number of flood victims in the 11 mukims was 683. The mukims of Belimbing Kiri and Belimbing Kanan had the highest number of flood victims at 179 and 172, respectively, accounting for 51 % of the total flood victims in Padang Terap. The educational levels of the flood victims were found to be quite low. The majority of respondents (538 respondents, 79 %) had experienced primary and secondary education only, while 99 respondents (14.5 %) had no formal education. As shown in Table 12.1, during floods the majority of respondents needed one or more of the following: (1) assistance with moving and lifting belongings, (2) food supplies, (3) access to means of communication, (4) rescue assistance, or (5) assistance in moving to a safe place. After flooding, 579 respondents required assistance to tidy up and clean their houses and equipment such as high-pressure jet sprays (Table 12.2)."

The largest population is the Carpathian population (> 7000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric- Pindos populations (> 3000 bears). The other populations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g. Karelian c. 850, Baltic c. 700, Cantabrian c. 200) to less than a hundred (e.g. Central Apennine 40â70, Alps 45â50, Pyrenean 22â27).

246,190,0.275,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Conservation objectives are the subject of much debate for regions with a long history of human alteration, like in most of Europe (Merckx et al. 2013). Climax forests have been replaced, often millennia ago, by so-called semi-natural biotopes, which are essentially different versions of early- to mid-successional natural seral stages, arrested from developing towards mature woodland. Nowadays, only scattered fragments of ancient woodland remain, and these have suffered continuous but varying disturbance regimes by humans. For example, up to a century ago most European woodland was maintained as coppice or coppice-with-standards. Today much woodland plantation has a uniformly closed canopy, which is shadier than is found in ancient forests with little history of human disturbance. A consequence of these various ways by which the development towards climax forest has been arrested, is that the rarest types of arboreal habitats in west-European countries today are those associated with rotting wood on ancient trees. These saproxylic habitats are associated with high extinction rates (Hambler et al. 2011), and support numerous invertebrate specialists, especially beetles and flies, and some moths (Thomas et al. 1994). Although many species undoubtedly suffered great losses (and extinctions) over the centuries during the transition from natural forest to semi-natural habitats, others (e.g. species associated with early-successional stages) did benefit or managed to adapt successfully to these semi-natural biotopes (e.g. heaths, meadows, coppiced woodland) (Young 1997; Monbiot 2013). Since the 1950s, agricultural intensification, forestry intensification, urbanization, and farmland abandonment have all severely decreased such semi-natural biotopes in quantity, quality, and connectivity, and with them their specialist fauna and Lepidoptera. As a result, most European âconservationistsâ traditionally seek to sustain or restore semi-natural biotopes, and do so by maintaining very specific disturbance regimes, often simply by copying traditional agricultural practices, since most large wild herbivores were excluded centuries ago (New 2009). Nevertheless, popular management operations to influence vegetation structure, such as burning and grazing/mowing, need careful planning (mainly to ensure refugia) as they may destroy much of the existing invertebrate fauna if applied too intensively, too infrequently, on too large a scale or at unsuitable times of year (New 2009). Hence, although wrongly applied conservation management may have unintended negative consequences, management is seen as a good thing overall, whereas rewilding is often perceived as a threat (Merckx et al. 2013). Abandonment of human disturbance does indeed pose a threat to many specialist species that have become adapted to certain semi-natural biotopes, especially when they have nowhere else to go because natural succession dynamics are currently too disturbed and suitable natural patches are too small and/or isolated. On the other hand, the recovery of native forest ecosystems due to farmland abandonment is likely to benefit a majority of Lepidoptera, since most moths (which make up 95 % of Lepidoptera) are reliant on woody foodplants or wooded biotopes.

Insects are a poor source of calcium and several studies have shown that calcium levels in the bones of female bats are lowest during lactation, as calcium is mobilized and transferred to the young in milk (Kwiecinski et al. 1987; Booher and Hood 2010). This led Barclay (1994, 1995) to suggest that shortage of calcium may be a greater constraint on reproduction than meeting its energy demands and that one of the reasons that bats roost in karst caves is that they acquire calcium by licking the walls, which is a common observation (Codd et al. 1999). There has been only one study to test this hypothesis, which was not supported by the evidence, since bats were distributed across all underground sites in a wide range of geological formations and were not concentrated in karst landscapes (Bernard and Davison 1996). Nevertheless, the fact that Adams et al. (2003) captured more female and juvenile bats over water holes with harder water (indicating higher calcium levels) suggests that environmental calcium is important, particularly for reproducing females and their young."

The American Center for Disease Control has had a standardised light trap for mosquito monitoring for over 50 years (Sudia and Chamberlain 1988). Moths, beetles and other crop pests are also commonly surveyed this way (Szentkiralyi 2002). However, light traps have a shorter history of use in the aquatic environment. The earliest uses were in freshwater for capturing insects and they were soon found to be excellent for collecting young ï¬sh (Hungerford et al. 1955) and zooplankton (Meekan et al. 2001; Ãresland 2007), but also collect many benthic species that emerge from the benthos at night. They have been used extensively around coral reefs where the structural complexity of the reef system makes other methods susceptible to damage (Doherty 1987). There can be species, gender and ontogenetic speciï¬c responses to light traps making them more useful for some organisms than others. Species may vary in their abundance at different times of the night and lunar cycle. A beneï¬t of light-trapping is that the animals are not harmed during collection, and have thus proved useful for sampling of museum specimens and laboratory animals (Doherty 1987; Holmes and OâConnor 1988). However, light trap catches may not work well in areas of high current or excessive turbidity. The potential of light traps for monitoring mobile benthic and demersal organisms, mostly crustaceans, has yet to be adequately explored.

Model results were tested against the long, spatially-resolved time series from the CPR and against detailed seasonal sampling of vertical distribution of life history stages. Increasing temperature is a major factor in observed changes in Calanus phenology, but changes in abundance are also influenced by advection of C. ï¬nmarchicus through the northern boundary of the North Sea, which is to some degree climate-related. The detailed observational time series available for the North Sea allow testing of quite complex process models on scales encompassing regional physical dynamics, water column processes and species life history. Observed changes in distribution and phenology are consistent with global patterns (Poloczanska et al. 2013), but there are important processes occurring at regional and local scales that modify the simple global pattern. It is probably too early to judge whether adaptive responses by marine zooplankton will keep pace with the current rapid changes in climate (Dam 2013). The observational time series for North Sea plankton are longer and have better temporal and spatial coverage and resolution than any other in the world. Since many taxa have plankton life stages these time series can be used to analyse long-term change not only in holoplankton, but also in meroplankton, including benthic species and ï¬sh, and examples are given in later sections."

Although only a few long-term records of salinity are available, making extrapolation or averaging of data across the region difficult, some datasets point to general trends. For example, annual mean river water salinity in the Poshur river at Mongla in Khulna (Fig. 5.1g) increased steadily from approximately <5 deciSiemens per metre (dS/m) in the early 1970s to approximately >50 dS/m in 2005.

260,58,0.274,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Although ranaviruses infecting freshwater fishes are relatively well characterized, less is known about the significance of ranaviruses infecting cultured or feral populations of marine fishes. Exceptions include two related ranaviruses, SGIV and GIV, which significantly impact grouper mariculture in Asia (Chua et al. 1994; Murali et al. 2002; Qin et al. 2003). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 26 conserved iridovirus genes demonstrated that GIV and SGIV are each otherâs closest relatives; however, these viruses are genetically divergent from other ranaviruses (Eaton et al. 2007). Therefore, GIV/SGIV may need to be considered as a new genus within the family Iridoviridae (Jancovich et al. 2015). SGIV was first identified following a mass mortality event of net-cage farmed brown-spotted grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) in Singapore in 1994 (Chua et al. 1994). The authors referred to the epizootic as Sleepy Grouper Disease; however, they failed to isolate or genetically characterize the virus. In 1998, the same disease was again observed in Singapore farms following imports of brown-spotted grouper fry from Taiwan (Qin et al. 2003). These authors genetically characterized the virus as a novel ranavirus, and named it SGIV (Qin et al. 2003). Similarly, GIV has negatively impacted production of yellow grouper (Epinephelus awoara) in Taiwan (Murali et al. 2002). Delivery of the virus to yellow grouper by injection resulted in 100 % mortality during experimental challenges (Murali et al. 2002). A recent study reported the isolation of SGIV and GIV strains from grouper and non-grouper species cultured in Taiwan (Huang et al. 2011, Table 3). This study illustrates the apparent expanding host range of SGIV/GIV including the first isolation of these viruses in freshwater (largemouth bass) and catadromous (barramundi) fishes. Other partially characterized ranaviruses from wild marine fishes include cod ranavirus (CoIV) isolated from Danish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; Ariel et al. 2010) and the short-finned eel ranavirus (SERV) isolated from short-finned eel (Anguilla australis) off the coast of New Zealand (Bang-Jensen et al. 2009). Ranaviruses isolated from seemingly healthy cultivated freshwater and marine fishes include the pike-perch iridovirus (PPIV) isolated from Finnish pike-perch fingerlings (Tapiovaara et al. 1998) and Ranavirus maxima (Rmax) isolated from Danish turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) fry (Ariel et al. 2010). Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of these fish viruses have revealed they represent previously unknown ranaviruses, warranting more comprehensive study into their biology and potential impact on cultivated and wild populations (Holopainen et al. 2009; Jancovich et al. 2015)."
36,607,0.274,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"13.5.3 Deterrents/Aversion Agents There is some evidence that strong smells such as rotting fish may deter bats from approaching ripening fruit and trials to investigate this are currently under way in Thailand (S. Bumrungsri, unpublished). Bicknell (2002) suggested that smoke could be used as an aversion agent, since it is known among Australian orchardists that it is disliked by flying foxes. On Tioman Island in Malaysia, anecdotal information from local communities relates that people build fires under roost trees in order to smoke out flying foxes, although the efficacy of this method is only temporary as it does not deter them from returning (S.A. Aziz, unpublished). Over the last 30 years in Australia, deterrents used by fruit growers have included flashing and rotating lights, electronic distress sounds, gas-operated bird scare guns, electric shocks, and smell and taste deterrents. However, most of these are used in isolation and their effectiveness has not been systematically assessed, with results being mixed and most evidence anecdotal (Ullio 2002). A project to trial smell and taste deterrents was carried out by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) and the Queensland Flying-fox Consultative Committee (QFCC) in 2000. This involved three different commercial products for repelling animals, but none provided complete protection, and the results were ultimately inconclusive due to the small scale of the testing. A plant secondary compound was also tested, with more promising results, and further trials were planned (Teagle 2002), although the outcome is unknown. Bicknell (2002) considered that shooting to frighten, rather than shooting to kill, could also be an effective method. A noise deterrent was developed in Australia in the late 1990s that reduced orchard crop losses caused by P. conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus, which was an adaptation of a bird deterrent known as the âPhoenix Wailerâ (Phoenix Agritech Canada Ltd). In essence, it was a sound system with four stereo channels. Each channel had a speaker in the centre of the crop and another at a corner. Sounds were randomly played on each channel, with the sound appearing to come from the centre of the stereo pair. Pellet scars on wing membranes of a large proportion of flying foxes captured in Australia indicate that they had been targeted using shotguns, and therefore, the deterrent system also reproduced a shooting scenario. Sounds of humans (motorbikes, dogs barking) came from one channel, then randomly from another channel came sounds of shotguns, and then from another the screams of a wounded flying fox. Trials in several fruit-growing areas were successful, but the results were not accepted by the industry, which instead called for government trials although these were not implemented. The fruit-growing industry itself did not support independent trials, so this novel approach to mitigation has not been adopted (G.C. Richards, unpublished). An ultrasonic repeller (Ultrason-X; Bird-X Inc, Chicago) was ineffective at preventing damage to longan panicles by P. niger in Mauritius. A similar device (Sonixgate, Tikod Trade Ltd.

However, they were not the only ones. Many farmers believed that their shepherds knew more about sick sheep and so summoned vets infrequently to their farms.26 They also consulted country medical practitioners about the health of their stock.27 Wider medical interest is revealed by commentaries on sheep diseases that appeared in the medical press.28 Doctors investigated these diseases in private farmbased research programmes, in their capacities as appointees to government committees of enquiry, and as public health doctors who worked to prevent animal challenges to human health.29 for example, Dr David Hamilton, the key medical participant in braxy and louping ill research, studied sick sheep during hiking holidays in the Highlands. Reportedly âon the news of an animal dying from braxy he would take to the hill with the shepherdsâ. He also conducted enquiries into cattle diseases on behalf of the HAS.30 Other expert participants in sheep disease investigations included amateur natural historians, and professional life scientists who occupied recently established university posts in biology and agriculture. Their involvement reflected the importance that the farmers who sponsored and promoted these investigations placed on the environment as a contributor to sheep disease. farming discussions frequently referred to the health implications of geology, soil, vegetation, season, temperature, wind direction, the lie of the land, and the presence of parasitic ticks and flukes that fed off sheep bodies and whose existence was, in turn, shaped by the characteristics of the soil, season and vegetation.31 Similar factors were commonly invoked in discussions of human health, particularly within colonial contexts.32 However, they had special 26 Armatage (1894). 27 Tellor (1879). 28 for example: Hutchinson (1877), âThe Report of the Departmental Committeeâ (1906), âThe Pathology of Louping-Ill and Braxyâ (1906).

169,205,0.274,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"What Is Habitat? Habitat is where aquatic organisms prefer to live or the living characteristics of a river that aquatic organisms are using. Although habitat is fundamentally a description of what animals use and where animals are found, most ecologists assume that habitat also is what animals need to survive and reproduce. Field experiments sensu âhabitat modelingâ give the most reliable data what animals need, and ecologists regularly engage in discussions about best available concepts, scales, and whether our habitat studies are properly designed and interpreted. However, in this chapter we assume that habitat is the part of a river that ï¬sh or benthic invertebrates and their life stages prefer for a successful survival and reproduction. Habitat modeling can contribute to meeting the ongoing challenge of wisely balancing demands for the environmental services between society and nature (Bain 1995). This is especially so for those environmental services that sustain the integrity of ecosystems, e.g., environmental ï¬ows (e-ï¬ow). Habitat modeling offers a tool to apply e-ï¬ow concepts for science research and management policy. The concept of e-ï¬ows is used to mitigate the impacts of altered ï¬ow regime, often by assigning compensation ï¬ow releases to maintain ecological integrity and a good ecological status (see Chap. 4). Ideally, attempts to establish or maintain environmental ï¬ow regimes will take into consideration the quantity, timing, duration, frequency, and quality of water ï¬ows needed to maintain ecosystems and the services they sustain. Prescriptions to reestablish ecologically suitable compensation ï¬ows can be based on hydrological metrics, e.g., percentage of average ï¬ow and/or hydraulic habitat algorithms. The latter link hydraulic descriptions of rivers with âpreferenceâ models of ï¬sh life stage responses to microhabitat hydraulics (Linnansaari et al. 2012). There is a growing consensus to combine these approaches, because hydrological metrics characterize temporal variations in the aquatic environment but are poorly suited to analyze spatial variations, whereas the opposite is true for hydraulic habitat models (e.g., Poff 2009; Poff and Zimmerman 2010). Furthermore, approaches have been proposed to model the ecological effects of ï¬ow regime on population processes (e.g., growth and survival; Armstrong and Nislow 2012) and dynamics rather than timeaveraged population abundance (Shenton et al. 2012). Hydrologically based methods are still the most widely used approaches internationally (Tharme 2003). This is probably due to their ease of use and low cost, since such methods use only âstream realâ or simulated ï¬ow data series. A naturally variable regime of ï¬ow, rather than just a minimum low ï¬ow, is required to sustain freshwater ecosystems (Poff et al. 1997; Bunn and Arthington 2002; Poff 2009), and this understanding has contributed to the implementation of environmental ï¬ow management on thousands of river kilometers worldwide (Lobb and Orth 1991; Linnansaari et al. 2012). The ï¬ow regime is regarded by many aquatic ecologists to be a key driver of ecological processes that sustain the integrity of river ecosystems. Flow is a major determinant of the parameters that constitute physical habitat in streams, which in turn, is a major determinant of biotic composition. Consequently, ï¬ow dynamics play an important role for aquatic organisms (see Chap. 4). Aquatic organisms have"

Given the pace of expansion of human activity, the twentieth century stood out as a very special era. For the most part of their long history, human beings have developed very slowly. During the Greek and Roman eras, humans lived to about 24â25 years old, and even after the passage of more than 2000 years in 1900, the average life expectancy was still only 31 years old, an increase of only a few years.

233,63,0.273,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"expressed enthusiasm for the option value idea (Maclaurin and Sterelny 2008, section 8.4) we now think that the answer lies elsewhere. The crucial problem with option value is that it ties the value of biodiversity to judgements about value made by ordinary people (consumers in the economistâs terms). Clearly actual assessments of such option value will be difï¬cult (Norton 1988). Even if we could assess such judgements, human beings are not good at reasoning about risk and they have limited biological knowledge. So it might be that peopleâs actual assessments about the option value in natural systems would be very poor guides to the likely effects of conservation on future human communities or on future ecosystems. If we hedge our bets to maximise future outcomes then we should do so based on our best information about the probability of such outcomes rather than on the estimates that consumers might make about such outcomes. In light of these issues, the value of biodiversity is better analysed as an instance of consequentialism, broadly applied. We should conserve biodiversity, not because people want to, but because doing so will on average lead to better outcomes for people and human communities of perhaps more broadly for moral patients (organisms capable of experiencing suffering).5 However, even the consequentialist interpretation faces an important objection developed at length in chapter 6 of Maier (2012). It might be objected that our uncertainty about future states of the biosphere and future goals and preferences of people implies that conservation based on a general measure of biodiversity is as likely to produce net harm as it is net beneï¬t (after all, the species we are conserving include many whose effects on human populations are currently unknown). There are of course instances in which diversity works against us, as when we are threatened by a diversity of pathogens. That said, ours is an extremely successful species with an extremely broad niche. We have become adept at harnessing a great variety of features of the natural world to an astounding variety of ends. The number of species that pose a serious threat to humanity is a vanishingly small proportion of the total species count. Moreover, a great number of weeds and pests are not harmful in their native habitat, but only become harmful when that habitat is radically disturbed or when they are introduced by humans into other ecosystems (Baker 1974). We therefore think it implausible that conserving unremarkable species will on average produce more harm than beneï¬t. Put another wayâwere possible, at the press of a button, to destroy all those species and biological communities not known to be of special value to humanity, we think it would be irrational to do so. Humanity (and perhaps other sufï¬ciently sentient species) would almost certainly be worse off. So where we cannot assess the likely payoff for conserving an individual unremarkable species, it is nonetheless rational to assume that that payoff will be positive. This does not of course tell us anything about how large such a payoff will be and we acknowledge that there is an interesting and difï¬cult question about weighing the beneï¬ts of such conservation against the opportunity cost of forgoing alter5"
219,212,0.273,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Introduction Land degradationâdeï¬ned as persistent or long-term loss of ecosystem services, has recently gained a more prominent attention in national and international agendas, especially after the food crisis in 2008 with spiking food and land prices (von Braun 2013) and higher demands for biofuels. The rising concern for sustainable development and poverty reduction has also contributed to increased attention to sustainable land management. Land degradation affects the poor the most since they heavily depend on natural resources. Despite the increasing need for addressing land degradation, investments in sustainable land management remain limitedâespecially in low income countries. An FAO study on agricultural investment showed a declining public investment in agricultural sector in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over the past three decades (FAO 2012), with the public expenditure per worker declining from US$152 in 1980â89 to only US$42 in 2005â07 (ibid). As part of efforts to raise awareness of the cost of inaction against land degradation, this study is conducted to determine the cost of land degradation across regions and globally. The study makes new contributions to literature by adopting the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005) deï¬nition of land degradation and, therefore, using the Total Economic Value (TEV) approach to determine the value of land degradation (see Nkonya et al. 2013)."
233,189,0.273,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"disconnected (Brooks and McLennan 1991; Grandcolas 1998). Current research (e.g., Elias et al. 2013) in the framework of community phylogenetics (Ricklefs and Latham 1992; Webb et al. 2002) shows that trophic webs have a phylogenetic structure. Phylogenetic niche conservatism mitigated by exploitative competition means that related species can have similar resource use (Cadotte et al. 2008; but see Mouquet et al. 2012). In this theoretical framework, a relict is then expected to exploit a unique niche, a prediction consistent with some of the adaptive explanations cited above (e.g., Parsons 2005), that relicts can be highly specialized (but inconsistent with relicts as generalists). Therefore, maximizing phylogenetic diversity for conservation can be expected to select for species whose resource use is unique (Srivastava et al. 2012; Winter et al. 2013). In cases where relicts are found in a very stable and specialized habitat harboring small communities, this original resource use might implicate a key ecosystem service (e.g., Gibert and Deharveng 2002). At the extreme, structuring ecological communities by conserving species on the basis of phylogenetic diversity should select against loss of function in communities, by retaining species with lower niche overlap even if ecological redundancy is decreased."

Fort Dauphin is among the coastal zones threatened by coastal erosion. A recent rise in sea level, landslides, and coastal erosion have become serious threats to this municipality. Since 2005, coastal erosion has resulted in loss of housing facilities, four recreational beaches, and road communication links. In 2011 and 2012, widespread diminishing of beaches was observed around the city, with some areas badly damaged. Coastal erosion can be classified as a major risk for the city due to the threat it poses to economic development activities. In light of this, in 2012 the government decided to finance coastal erosion surveys through the PIC (Pole IntegrÃ© de Croissance) project. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, climate change marked by increasing temperature and a rise in sea level will place populations living in coastal areas in grave danger in 80 yearsâ time. Moreover, Key human activities (Neuvy 1981; Schiereck 2004; Williams and Micallef 2009; Brebbia et al. 2009; Kim 2010; Slovinsky 2011) are located in coastal zones. In other words, the pressures of climate change and increase in human activity toward the coasts has turned coastal erosion into a more serious problem, not only for coastal municipalities, but for the world as a whole (Prasetya and Black 2003; Niesing 2005). Coastal erosion is usually the outcome of many factors in combination including natural and human-induced influences operating on different scales (Shore Protection Manual 1984; Ir Zamani Bin Mindu 1988; DGENV European Commission 2004; Williams and Micallef 2009; Slovinsky 2011). In undertaking this case study, therefore, it was necessary to understand the factors responsible for coastal erosion in order to develop mitigation strategies. Fort Dauphin is an urban municipality in the southern part of Madagascar. According to the administration division, it is the capital of Anosy Region, and Amboasary district is positioned at the south eastern limit of Madagascar, in an area where winds blow from the Indian Ocean (Fig. 13.1). Geomorphologically, this study area is characterized in its eastern part by a small coastal plain dominated by the Anosyan Mountains. Morphological disposition makes the region highly exposed to winds blowing from the east (alize) and orographic lifting occurs frequently (Ratsivalaka Randriamanga 1985). The contacts with the ocean in the eastern and southern parts of the study area constitute cliffs varying between 5 and 10 m in height."
179,148,0.273,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 1: Water Quality, Sediments, Sediment Contaminants, Oil and Gas Seeps, Coastal Habitats, Offshore Plankton and Benthos, and Shellfish","The Gulf of Mexico (and environs) is one of the most important places for birds in the Western Hemisphere because it has species whose major ranges are in both North and South America, and hosts a wide range of migrants. Nearly 400 species have been reported from the Gulf. Approximately 31 % of the 395 species found in the Gulf have been recorded in all areas of the Gulf. The high diversity in birds in the Gulf of Mexico is due to the Gulfâs diversity of habitats, richness of marine-land interface, a gradient from tropical to temperate, and the geography of the Gulf which places it as the funnel point for Nearctic-neotropical migrants. Most birds that use saltwater to brackish ecosystems are seabirds, herons and egrets, shorebirds, waterfowl, gulls, terns, and specialized marsh species such as clapper rail and seaside sparrow. Assessment of 15 indicator species for the Gulf shows that mottle ducks, black skimmer, and clapper rail have declined over the last 45 years, while brown pelican, great egret, and osprey have increased. Declines seem to be related to habitat loss, coupled with human disturbance and other disruptions. Higher species diversity of birds is found in the southern Gulf of Mexico than in the northern coast. A higher percentage of some colonial species nesting in North America do so in Louisiana and Texas rather than elsewhere along the Gulf. Habitat loss is the primary threat facing birds in the Gulf of Mexico, due to both natural and anthropogenic causes, and it is occurring at an ever-increasing rate. One of the greatest impacts on avian populations in the Gulf of Mexico is habitat loss (either because it is less available, or because what is available is no longer suitable), followed by human disturbance. Populations of birds in the Gulf have varied greatly over the past 50 years; some have increased and some have declined."
233,169,0.273,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Abstract A relict is a species that remains from a group largely extinct. It can be identiï¬ed according both to a phylogenetic analysis and to a fossil record of extinction. Conserving a relict species will amount to conserve the unique representative of a particular phylogenetic group and its combination of potentially original characters, thus lots of phylogenetic diversity. However, the focus on these original characters, often seen as archaic or primitive, commonly brought erroneous ideas. Actually, relict species are not necessarily old within their group and they can show as much genetic diversity as any species. A phylogenetic relict species can be geographically or climatically restricted or not. Empirical studies have often shown that relicts are at particular risks of extinction. The term relict should not be used for putting a misleading emphasis on remnant or isolated populations. In conclusion, relict species are extreme cases of phylogenetic diversity, often endangered and with high symbolic value, of important value for conservation.

Habitat characteristics were analysed in a radius of 100 m around the sampled point, using a detailed habitat classiï¬cation (Kerbiriou et al. 2010). Species calls were identiï¬ed through spectrogram analyses. At large scale, we found that activity of common bats in railway verges was of the same order of magnitude as in other habitats, except for aquatic habitats, which are known as key habitats for numerous European bat species (Russo and Jones 2003; Nicholls and Racey 2006). Furthermore, we found that activity was even greater in railway verges than in some other habitats for two aerial species: N. leislerii and P. pipistrellus. For P. pipistrellus, a very generalist species (Russ and Montgomery 2002), activity in railway verges was greater than in seven other habitats. Overall, bat activity among railway verges was not inferior to the activity in highly modiï¬ed habitats such as continuous artiï¬cial surfaces, discontinuous artiï¬cial surfaces and arable land (conï¬rmed for 4 of the 5 taxa studied). At local scale, we found a negative effect of railway areas on the Myotis spp. for the two sample periods and a positive effect on Nyctalus spp. for the post-reproductive period. When focusing the analysis on the site type, we detected few obvious signiï¬cant differences in bat activity between the verges of railways and the three other site types (ï¬eld verges, plain ï¬eld and plain wood). The signiï¬cant difference for Nyctalus spp. during the post-reproductive period (lower activity in woods than on railway verges) may seem contradictory with the positive effect of surrounding areas of wood for these species at the same period. The foraging ecology of these aerial hawking bats and their habitat requirements could explain these results: Nyctalus spp. are species that forage mainly along edges, thus more in forest verges than in the heart of forests, but otherwise inhabit the interior of the forests, thus the amount of woodland habitat at the landscape level would have also an overall positive effect. It must be noted that except for the Myotis spp. group in the reproductive period, we detected no difference between the verges of railways and those of ï¬elds. This result seems to indicate a similar functioning role for railway verges on bats as that of other linear verges, particularly on common aerial hawking bats (Verboom and Huitema 1997). Our results suggest that the presence of railway verges does not influence signiï¬cantly the foraging/commuting activity of common bats, except for species like those from the Myotis group, a group including mostly gleaner species, less generalist species (Dietz et al. 2007) and some threatened species (Temple and Terry 2009). In several cases (for P. pipistrellus at global scale and for Nyctalus spp. at local scale), railway verges even seem to provide a signiï¬cant habitat in intensive agricultural landscapes where semi-natural elements, in particular linear elements like hedgerows, tend to disappear. Railways, along with other artiï¬cial linear infrastructures, may thus contribute to maintaining common bat populations in such landscapes."

Here policy options are seen not as solutions but as hypotheses to be tested under a regime where formalized learning and management are objectives for which experimentation is the key (Rist et al. 2013). Interventions can be risky, especially in riverine SES, which are â. . .open systems that cannot be isolated from their social contextâ (Konrad et al. 2011). However, some river managers do choose to actively intervene in response to some emerging problem. Often a lack of data challenges managers trying to understand and manage how environmental ï¬ows contribute to the serviceable functioning of a river. A history of water control structure construction has almost eliminated naturally ï¬owing rivers. In North America construction of more than 2.5 million control structures have left less than 2% of all rivers naturally ï¬owing (Lytle and Poff 2004), with a similarly small percentage of naturally ï¬owing rivers in Europe (see Chap. 6). This denies most managers naturally occurring reference ï¬ow conditions to use as performance criteria. Social awareness of this extreme state has been heightened by the growing recognition of societyâs dependence on increasingly fragile aquatic resources. Many rivers are stressed and over-allocated in order to serve the demands of growing populations through hydro-engineering (Chen et al. 2015). In response, societal values have shifted to question this history, and managers have been compelled to modify operations of these control structures to mitigate physical and biological impacts on aquatic ecosystems (Rood et al. 2003)."

252,58,0.273,The Ethics of Vaccination,"responsibility can be characterized as metaphysical arguments: they concern the issue as to what makes an obligation âcollectiveâ and the nature of the relationship between such collective obligations and the individual obligations of the collectiveâs constituent members. Without the presumption of exhaustiveness, I will present in this section some of the metaphysical conceptions of collective obligation and of its relation with individual obligations. I will apply these considerations to the case of the collective obligation to realize herd immunity and its relation to the individual obligation to be vaccinated. Let us start with the case of the trapped man, discussed by Virginia Held (1970). In her example, three pedestrians notice a man trapped under a collapsed building. They can save the man by removing the beams that keep him trapped. However, they fail to organize as a collective and to decide which beam to remove first; as a consequence, the trapped man dies. According to Held, the three men are collectively morally responsible for failing to form an organized group that could have saved the trapped man. This example is taken by Held to show that collective responsibility of random collections is simply distributive: each individual is individually responsible for the groupâs failure. As put by Held, âif random collection R is morally responsible for the failure to do A, then every member of R is morally responsible for the failure to do A, although, perhaps, in significantly different proportionsâ (Held 1970, p. 480). Held applied this principle of distributive collective responsibility to the case of backward-looking responsibility. However, the same principle can be applied to future-looking moral responsibility, that is, moral obligations. Consider, for instance, the analogous âcoordinated bystanderâ case discussed by Tracy Isaacs (2011, 2014), which we have presented above. According to Isaacs, the putative collective obligation has âexactly the same ordering and mediating potential for individual action that an actual collective obligation wouldâ (Isaacs 2011, p. 150). In cases like this, it is clear (to the reasonable person) what the group should do in order to save the children, so the group agent has the putative collective obligation to save the children. In virtue of this putative collective obligation, Isaacs argues, each individual has a moral obligation to do her part (Isaacs 2011, p. 151) to contribute to the fulfilment of the putative collective obligation. As Isaacs put it, âthis putative collective obligation (â¦) is a starting point for bridging the apparent gap between seemingly inconsequential individual contributions and new understandings of the part they play in more powerful collective undertakingsâ (Isaacs 2011, pp. 151â152)."

Since ancient times, and more intensively from the mid-19th century, the development of human settlements, infrastructure and economic activities is expanding more and more in the mountain region and the space belonging to land and water has been reduced. On the surface that previously belonged to the river have developed agriculture, transport routes and settlements. At the end of the 20th century, development spread over hazardous areas, many torrent flowed in highly conï¬ned channels, and ground water recharges dropped down, instability of land surface and security for inhabitants decreased. This resulted in reduction of water resources of appropriate quality, reduction of space for sediment deposit, increase of erosion, impacts on natural habitats, causing major flood damage, decrease of groundwater stock, and deterioration of water quality. The water regime integrates all events across space from landslides, debris flow and is manifested in river regime in low lands (Brilly 2015). This problem is partially covered by many United Nations (UN) and UNESCO documents and reports. Proper actions are also suggested in the Ministerial Declaration from the 7th World Water Forum (World Water Council 2015), where the ï¬rst mentioned action is the signiï¬cance of appropriate land management in relation to sustainable water management and planning. More Room for Landslides actually means more space for control of potential landslides caused by human activities that cause slope instability; more space for torrents; more space for water and sediment storages and less impact on the slope stability; consequentially higher security for the people. The occurrence of landslides in Slovenia can be expected at approx. 1/3 of the total surface area (RibiÄiÄ et al. 2005). However, more and more intense and concentrated use of space is increasing risk of landslide occurrence. Furthermore, there are also spatial interventions at unstable areas by which conditionally stable areas change into unstable. Landslides in Slovenia most often occur as consequence of heavy rainfall, which means that landslides are inseparably linked to water. In our paper we present three cases of landslides that have occurred in the past on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, and discuss how could measures in the ï¬eld of spatial planning reduce risk and consequential damage in these cases. We have focused on cases where analysis has shown that due to improperly designed or maintained forest roads and skid trails, the damage was greater: StoÅ¾e (2000), Laze Dolsko and Slapnica (2009), Upper Savinja Valley (1990)."

Gulf of Mexico estuaries were estimated to be approximately 30,000 km2 (11,600 mi2) representing 42 % of the total estuarine surface area of the United States excluding Alaska. The Mississippi River drainage area was estimated to be more than 4 million km2 (1.5 million mi2), which is more than 55 % of the total area of the conterminous United States. The Gulf of Mexico was receiving an average of 27,473 cubic meters per second (m3/s) of freshwater inflow daily which was more than 50 % of the daily average for the continental United States. Land use within a watershed determines the materials carried by runoff into adjacent coastal areas. In classifying the landuse categories of the five Gulf States (not the entire watershed), forest and agriculture occupied approximately 58 % of the land area. Forests provide filtration for sediment and nutrients from runoff, stabilize shorelines, and reduce erosion. In the Gulf of Mexico many forests are distant from the shore and are being rapidly replaced by urban and agricultural expansions. Agricultural land included pasture and cropland. Pastureland included grassy areas to raise and feed livestock, and cropland was cultivated for various food products. Other land uses located close to the coastline included wetland habitats (17 %) and urban areas (5 %). While the mix of activities varies with time and place, this snapshot provides an overview of the types of activities that are and will continue to be important for water quality along the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region."

In SESs, interactions between hierarchical levels may function as feedbacks (Gunderson and Holling 2002). From the perspective of rangeland managers or policy organizations, feedbacks may act as both vulnerabilities and opportunities. Where positive feedback loops have negative consequences, such as the conversion of ranchland mentioned previously, extra precautions should be taken to prevent those feedbacks from taking effect. Where feedback loops create positive change, short-term expenditures may be justified by long-term benefits. For example, establishing venues for stakeholder meetings and management collaboration may require investing additional time and money but result in steadily increasing participation that reduces management costs and improves outcomes in the long run. Whether positive or negative, recognizing the presence of feedback is a crucial step."
231,774,0.273,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"increase has a substantial effect on the community and the ecosystem, modifying their biodiversity and carrying capacity (Beaugrand et al. 2008). An abrupt ecosystem shift occurred in the North Sea during the mid-1980s (Fig. 8.4) (Reid et al. 2001). The North Sea is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world. This system supports important ï¬sheries leading to the catch of 5 % of the worldâs total ï¬sh and also contributes signiï¬cantly to biogeochemical cycles (Thomas et al. 2004). The North Sea regime shift has involved an increase in phytoplankton biomass, and changes in plankton community structure, diversity and phenology (Reid et al. 1998; Beaugrand et al. 2003; Beaugrand 2004). The shift was detected in both pelagic and benthic realms (KrÃ¶ncke et al. 1998; Reid and Edwards 2001; Warwick et al. 2002). Parallel changes occurred in large-scale and regional temperatures, in three trophic levels and in both holozooplanktonic and merozooplanktonic components (Kirby and Beaugrand 2009). The abrupt ecosystem shift that occurred during the 1980s in the North Sea had a detectable effect on about 40 % of species from all taxonomic groups collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey (Beaugrand et al. 2014). The effect of warming on ecosystems is not a gradual process and species and communities are likely to experience a series of sudden and stepwise shifts alternating with periods of greater stability."
230,421,0.273,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.3 Interactions of Microplastics with Marine Organisms Recently, Wright et al. (2013a) discussed the biological factors, which could enhance microplastic bioavailability to marine organisms: the varying density of microplastics allows them to occupy different areas of the water column and benthic sediments. As microplastics interact with plankton and sediment particles, both suspension and deposit feeders may be at risk of accidentally or selectively ingesting marine debris. However, the relative impacts are likely to vary across the size spectrum of microplastic in relation to the organisms affected, which is dependent on the size of the microplastic particles encountered. Microplastics in the upper end of the size spectrum (1â5 mm) may compromise feeding and digestion. For example, Codina-GarcÃ­a et al. (2013) isolated such pellets and fragments from the stomachs of seabirds.

The total loss of ecosystem services due to land-use/cover change (LUCC), wetlands degradation and use of land degrading management practices on grazing lands and selected croplands is about 2007 US$75 billion, which is about 16 % of the countryâs GDP. LUCC accounts for 94 % of the loss, underscoring the need for developing more effective land use planning and incentives land users to protect high value biomes. The returns to taking action against land degradation is about US$4 per US$ investedâjustifying the need to take action to improve human welfare and environmental protection. The actions against land degradation include investment in restoration of degraded lands and prevention of land degradation through stricter regulation of agricultural expansion into forests and other higher value biomes. They also include reforestation and other restoration efforts; protection wetlands and restoration of degraded wetlands. The excessive use of agrochemicals also require action to regulate their potential off-site effects. Case studies also show that promotion of rotational grazing, extending conservation agriculture beyond soybean; tillage method and crop-livestock production systems offer promising strategies for addressing land degradation. The world has a lot to learn from Argentinaâgiven its rapid poverty reduction and successful adoption rate of conservation agriculture using public-private partnership. If Argentina aims at maintaining its economic and social development, it will need to work harder to address its growth-related environmental challenges that affect the poor the most. Argentina is better prepared to face these challenges. This study will contribute to informing policy makers on the best strategies for taking action against land degradation and the returns to such actions."

Larger amounts of nectar or honey are consumed by wax-producing bees, brood-attending bees, âwinterâ bees, and foragers, with foragers consuming relatively large amounts (Rortais et al. 2005 and references therein). For honeybees, the potential for exposure to CPY can be greater during production of bee bread by worker bees than in other activities in the colony. To make bee bread, workers break newly collected pollen balls deposited by foragers, mix the pollen with saliva and honey, and pack it into cells with their mandibles and tongue (Dietz 1975). It is possible that the appearance of dead bees in front of a hive following accidental overexposure to pesticides could be the result of these bees being exposed to a greater dose than the forager bees (Atkins 1975)."

Carbon and nitrogen stocks (C) in vegetation (above and belowground) were significantly higher in moderately grazed paddocks than in exclosure and intensively grazed ones (OÃ±atibia et al. 2015; Fig. 14.4). In this example, the relationship between forage biomass and carbon and nitrogen stocks had a positive linear relationship indicating that a trade-off did not occur (Fig. 14.4). A trade-off between a supporting and a provisioning ecosystem service occurred in Patagonian rangelands. Grazing intensity shows a unimodal relationship species richness with a maximum value at moderate grazing intensities (Perelman et al. 1997; Fig. 14.5a). A decrease in richness is associated with intensive grazing because local extinction of forage species was not compensated by remaining nonpalatable or weedy species. Patch diversity is another critical component of biodiversity in rangelands (Chap. 5, this volume). Abundance of different patch types shows a response similar to that of species richness. Under moderate grazing conditions, high-cover patches decrease whereas low-cover patches increase."
36,702,0.272,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"In a study of the cave complex in Ankarana National Park in the limestone massif of northern Madagascar, Cardiff (2006) found that longer caves, more complex caves, those with larger entrances or with entrances at lower elevation and those with less temporal variation in ambient temperature all had significantly higher bat species richness. In a similar study in the karstic Bemaraha National Park in western Madagascar, Kofoky et al. (2007) found that species richness and abundance was low in all but one of 16 cavesâAnjohikinakina, which contained five species and over 9000 individuals of one. This cave was difficult to access and, unlike some of the others in the national park, was seldom visited by tourists. These findings are broadly reflected in East Asia. In a study of 255 subterranean sites in central and eastern China, Luo et al. (2013) found that bat species richness was positively correlated with cave size and negatively correlated with human disturbance. The incidence of nationally threatened and endemic species was also positively correlated with species richness, which was greater in caves formerly used for tourism than in abandoned mines. In a study of 25 subterranean sites in Funiu Mountain (eastern China), Niu et al. (2007) similarly found that bat species distributions were highly dependent on the type and size of roost, with large caves supporting unusually high species richness and abundances. Over 80 % of the bats recorded were located on the southern side of the mountain which was attributed to climatic differences (higher annual rainfall and average temperatures) and the higher incidence of large caves there. Nagy and Postawa (2010) further explored the relationship between cave variables and bat occupancy during the hibernation and breeding seasons in 79 caves"

In 2012, Gabonâs environment competitiveness ranked 19th worldwide, going ahead of other African countries and even having its advantages compared with other countries globally. Among the 5 sub-indexes, 2 ranked top 10, accounting for 40 %; no indicator EMC ranked below the 100th. Among the 16 pillars, 11 were in the top 60, accounting for 68.8 %; 2 ranked below 100th, accounting for 12.5 %. Among the 60 individual indicators, 37 were in the top 60, accounting for 61.7 %; and only 9 indicators ranked below the 100th, accounting for 15 %. As a whole, the indicator rankings were in the front, which determines the advantage of Gabonâs environment competitiveness. Republic of Gabon, which has been known as âforest republicâ and âcountry of green goldâ, has 22 million hectares of forest, about 85 % of national land. But, Gabon didnât start large-scale exploitation of forest; instead, it took the protection of ecological environment and wildlife resources as a fundamental policy and established long-term mechanism for sustainable development to keep a balance between economic development and protection of ecological environment. In 2002, President Bongo announced that the country would build 13 national parks covering an area of nearly 2.6 million hectares of land in order to protect the important habitat of wildlife. The central government of the Republic of Gabon also strengthened the protection of ecological environment and wildlife through legislation and organization structuring, specifically establishing two ministries, i.e. the Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Sustainable Development and the Ministry of Tourism and National Parks. The government believes that the national park program is of global significance as certain medium-/short-term sacrifice may preserve this natural wealth for human descendants. The series of environmental protection measures made Gabon a model country in the field of protecting ecological environment and wildlife. 1. EHC and REC rank in the front in Africa and shows advantages even worldwide. During the evaluation period, Gabonâs REC ranked 3rd, and the Forest Resources pillar is ranked 1st, which was the most direct result and most effective reflection of the strong awareness of forest conservation and protection measures.

The recommended CR values for 137Cs in marine zooplankton, fish, and crustaceans are 40, 100, and 50, respectively (IAEA 2004). In this chapter, we did not calculate CR under equilibrium conditions; therefore, the CR value was referred to as the âapparent CR (aCR)â and was compared to the pre-FNPP CR. In June 2011, only 3 months after the FNPP accident, the Fisheries Research Agency initiated a monitoring program to measure the environmental concentration of FNPP-derived radioactive Cs in different marine ecosystems, such as seawater, sediments, zooplankton, benthos, and fishes, in the most severely affected area off the coasts of Fukushima, Miyagi, and Ibaraki Prefectures (hereafter JobanâSanriku coast) and in Sendai Bay (Fig. 3.1). In this chapter, we describe temporal changes in the concentrations of 137Cs in seawater and zooplankton off the JobanâSanriku coast and in Sendai Bay that occurred from June 2011 to December 2013 based on data from Kaeriyama et al.

376,655,0.272,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Livestockâwildlife competition operates through two sets of processes within the socialâecological systems we call rangelands: economic processes influence agricultural and wildlife-based enterprises as sources of income for producer communities; ecological processes influence the relative efficiencies of livestock and wildlife species in utilizing the food and water resources occurring in their shared range. At the global scale, economic processes generally result in agricultural returns outcompeting wildlife returns and the patchwork of land use within rangelands intensifying towards croplands and fragmented rangelands (Hobbs et al. 2008). As markets, technology, and infrastructure develop, the position of a rangeland on its production possibility frontier (PPF) changes (Bastian et al. 1991; Smith et al. 2012) with agricultural production becoming specialized, driving down the possibilities for wildlife production (Fig. 12.1). The transition begins with a fully intact wildlife community (Point A) as still occurs in wildlife reserves, game ranches, and areas where diseases (e.g., trypanosomiasis in Africa) exclude livestock. Eventually livestock production is so specialized (Point C; irrigated and fertilized pastures, winter supplementation, fenced paddocks, etc.) that wildlife production is impossible. In some cases, well-regulated hunting for trophies and meat can add to the rangelandâs production potential from livestock (Point B), and infrastructure (waterpoints, access roads, etc.) provided for livestock production can also be beneficial to the sustainable utilization of wildlife. However, in most rangelands the transition has proceeded directly to maximizing livestock production (Point C) and restoring the wildlife community would necessitate a disproportionate pull-back in agricultural production, with unaffordable opportunity costs. Avoiding or overcoming those costsâincurred by foregoing land-use opportunities that are incompatible with wildlifeârequires innovative policies to enable competitive and sustainable returns from wildlife to local communities and private landowners (Norton-Griffiths and"

These Omo River dependent communities maintain complex social and material exchange with other Nyangatom settlements in both the Kibish River-Koras Mountain area at Ethiopiaâs western border and in the Ilemi Triangle-South Sudan, where they share lands with the Toposa ethnic group. Nyangatom pastoralists and agropastoralists frequently clash with Dasanech and Turkana herders over grazing lands and water resources. The extensive Omo riverine forestâthe last such pristine forest within semi-arid Sub-Saharan Africaârequires substantial soil moisture retention from the Omo Riverâs annual flood. Cessation of the flood would quickly promote the death of the forest and destruction of its abundant wildlife and resources essential to Nyangatom survival. Thousands of Nyangatom living along the river would suffer immediate disaster from the effects of Gibe dam closure and dam enabled irrigated agricultural enterprises. Like the Dasanech, the Nyangatom also are subjected to major expropriation and repression by the Ethiopian government, as well as major cutting of their forest by the Ethiopian government and its allied development interests."
273,40,0.272,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"Biodiversity includes genetic (biological genes) diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity; it is the core component of Earthâs life-support system and the material basis of human survival and development. However, in the past hundreds of years, due to the adverse impact of human activity, species extinction rate has been 1,000 times that of natural species extinction rate in history.3 Now there are about 12 % of birds, 23 % of mammals and 25 % of conifers faced with the risk of extinction.4 As UNEP forecasts, there will be 1/4 of biologic species on the earth trapped in the danger of extinction for the forthcoming two or three decades; by 2050, about half of all animals and plants will disappear from the earth. In order to protect biodiversity, the globe has been devoted to finding a roadmap for protection of biodiversity since 2010 and the 10th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity held in October 2010 in Japan approved the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011â2020, which established the goal of global biodiversity by 2020 and designed the roadmap and time schedule for global biodiversity protection.5"
169,416,0.272,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Methodological Approaches to Develop a âLeitbildâ/Deï¬ne Reference Conditions A long-standing and highly reliable method for deï¬ning reference conditions is the ï¬eld assessment of close-to-natural reference sites for the related river type. This is ideally done within the respective river system or the geographical region. If appropriate sites are not available, comparable sites on other rivers should be investigated. In practice, it is often time-consuming to investigate such relatively undisturbed habitats. However, such meticulous approaches will provide the most reliable information, even quantitative data, which is often missing because of its high cost. Collected over several time slots, such âlong-term dataâ can help to deï¬ne natural variability. Severe hydromorphological modiï¬cations of most large rivers in the industrialized world have all but eliminated near-natural reference sites (Dynesius and Nilsson 1994; Nilsson et al. 2005). Efforts to rigorously identify type-speciï¬c conditions increasingly rely on historical data (maps and records) from preindustrial eras. These help describe facets of âreference ecosystems,â e.g., communities of aquatic species or geomorphological characteristics prior to large-scale river engineering for transport (channels) and energy (dams) (Muhar et al. 2000, 2008). Most such data was collected for larger river systems, e.g., for the Mississippi and Illinois rivers (Sparks 1995) and also for many large European rivers (Petts 1989; Hohensinner et al. 2008). Surveys have preserved centuries-old data of geography (land surveys), botany, and zoology (plant and animal communities) or decades-long records of hydrology (daily water-level records) and plant and animal surveys extending more than 100 years back (Jungwirth et al. 2002). Spatially based data as well as historybased deï¬nitions of reference conditions can be complemented by modeling approaches (Petts and Amoros 1996) as long as a reliable database of sufï¬cient size is available or can be established. The development pathway of a riverine landscape can then be simulated on computer and used as a reference scenario to compare with current conditions. Several reference scenario approaches have been developed in the Netherlands (Harms and Wolfert 1998) where drastic changes to the environmental context of lowland rivers make it difï¬cult to extrapolate from past conditions to the present. GIS data has been used to simulate trajectories of vegetation and fauna in space and time for a landscape ecological decision support system (LEDESS). Alternatively, with current hydrodynamical and hydromorphological characteristics as a âstarting point,â one can use the âintrinsic ecological potentialâ of vegetation and fauna to explore what development paths are possible and thereby deï¬ne rehabilitation goals (Pedroli et al. 2002; Egger et al. 2015). Nijboer et al. (2004) recommended not to rely only on a single method for deï¬ning reference conditions. Rather, complementary methodological approaches should help to âget the full picture.â Finally, all qualitative and quantitative data gained should undergo an expert appraisal in order to review the data with regard to plausibility and potentially complete the reference model by expert knowledge. The processes described above emphasize the core approach for deï¬ning reference conditions from a river ecosystem perspective. Equally important as part of an"

241,920,0.271,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"16.3.2.1 Salinity In the Baltic Sea, changes in salinity can have a cascading effect on food webs through the whole pelagic ecosystem (HÃ¤nninen et al. 2003; Wasmund et al. 2011). Some climate change scenarios project a decrease in Baltic Sea salinity, while others project an increase (BACC Author Team 2008; Chap. 13). A fall in salinity would lead to a decrease in marine species and an increase in freshwater species (MÃ¶llmann et al. 2005; MacKenzie et al. 2007), while an increase in salinity would cause the reverse. Changes in salinity would probably affect coastal birds and seabirds indirectly, mainly through changes in food availability. For instance, distribution and size of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis are highly dependent on salinity (Westerbom et al. 2008), whereas the Baltic clam Macoma balthica has a greater capacity to acclimatise to highly dilute brackish conditions (Jansen et al. 2009). As it is mediated by food availability, the relationship between salinity and bird populations may not become apparent immediately (RÃ¶nkÃ¤ et al. 2005). 16.3.2.2 Water Temperature The marine ecosystem is sensitive to changes in water temperature, which can affect the plankton (Dahlgren et al. 2011; Wasmund et al. 2011) as well as ï¬sh reproduction and survival (Margonski et al. 2010), and may thus have an impact on the food resources of coastal birds and seabirds.

When caged adult alfalfa leafcutting bees, M. rotundata, were exposed to alfalfa plants sprayed with CPY (Lorsban 4E, 2.5 kg haâ1), significant mortality was observed. The population of males was reduced by approximately 90% after only 2 d, and the population of females was reduced by 30% relative to the controls. No significant additional mortality of female M. rotundata was observed after the first 4â5 d of exposure (Gregory et al. 1992). It was suggested that male M. rotundata were more sensitive to CPY due to their reduced metabolic capacity and smaller surface area to volume ratio compared to females. Studies to evaluate the toxicity of CPY to three species of bees have been conducted (Lunden et al. 1986). Field applications of 1.12 kg haâ1, followed by 24-h continuous exposure to the treated foliage in small cages was lethally toxic to adult honey bees, alfalfa leafcutting bees (M. rotundata), and alkali bees (Nomia melanderia Cock.) for 5â7 d, whereas a rate of 0.56 kg haâ1 was toxic for 4â6 d. In field tests on several crops, mortality was observed with application of CPY and reduced foraging was observed for 1â7 d (Lunden et al. 1986). Effects on NTA as a surrogate for non-Apis bees. Tier-2 tests with surrogate NTA species on a natural substrate such as foliage are more realistic than Tier-1 tests that utilize glass plates (Candolfi et al. 2001), but are still conservative because the test organisms are constrained on or near the treated surface. As with the Tier-1 assessment, no contact toxicity data were found for the recommended wasp species A. rhopalosiphi. There were data for B. hebetor (Ahmed and Ahmad 2006) exposed to CPY via leaves of cotton, but unfortunately the method of treatment, dipping the leaves in an aqueous solution, did not allow the deposition on the surface of the leaf to be calculated, making the data unusable in this risk assessment."

This contrasts with visions of Western states and UN agencies as endowed with the means and resources for assessing the situation and best planning any intervention. In this vision, they are courageous and generous agents ready to self-sacrifice, have great care for human lives, and have the capacity to act (AJ 1-3; TG 1-2). When the international community fails to comply with these standards publicly, its accountability is established through different techniques. First, other responsibilities are identified and often these are not elements within the control of the so-called international community: for example, the weather or the bureaucratic system is seen as hampering rescue efforts in the Mediterranean (TG 2-4). Also, the irrationality of other actors can be used to explain the international communityâs failures: sub-Saharans in desperate situations would be inclined to not exercise clear judgement and to put their lives at risk, as when, trying to capture the attention of a rescue boat, they move to one side of their ship, causing it to capsize (TG 2). Moreover, NATO and EU states are pictured as self-reflexive and prone to take actions that will improve their tactics and strategies of intervention, for instance improving coordination efforts for evacuations and lifesaving missions at sea (NYT 5-7; TG 78:). Finally, media and other actors take the role of powerful watchdog, engaged to show the international community unforeseen problems and to envision possible solutions, as in the case of unanticipated migratory movements towards Europe or racist attacks on black Libyans and migrants in Libya (AJ 2-35-6; NYT 5; TG 5-7-10). In this case, in addition to migrantsâ testimonies employed to confirm the information presented, many references to Western values of liberal democracy serve as guidelines for actions, completely legitimizing the actual organization of the world order and failing to address existing inequalities and imbalances (AJ 2-6-9; NYT 5; TG 7). In a nutshell, media represented the Libyan conflict as a step in the countryâs process towards Western ideals and modernity; they show its migration crises as the result of irrational, cruel, and short-sighted policies by Gaddafi, and this implies that support for the management of migratory movements by Western interventions was necessary to achieve security, freedom, and the democratic principles of the international order. Direct and subtle associations in the articles analysed indicate strongly that media conveyed suggestions that reinforced mainstream international models while play-acting mobilizations for migrantsâ"

Earthquake-induced coastal or submarine large-scale landslides or megaslides (with depths on the order of hundreds of meters to one thousand meters) in the ocean floor can trigger large tsunami waves. These hazardous motions of soil and water impacting on exposed and vulnerable population can result into very damaging effects. â¢ The combined effects of triggering factors, including rainfall, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, can lead to greater impacts through disastrous landslides such as lahars, debris flows, rock falls, and megaslides. â¢ Understanding landslide disaster risk requires a multi-hazard approach and a focus on social and institutional vulnerability. The study of social and institutional as well as physical vulnerability is needed to assess the extent and magnitude of landslide disasters and to guide formulation of effective policy responses. â¢ Human intervention can make a greater impact on exposure and vulnerability through, among other factors, land use and urban planning, building codes, risk assessments, early"

230,546,0.271,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Exceptions to this include shellfish such as mussels, clams and some shrimps that are eaten whole or with their gut. The risk of ingesting microplastics contained within other tissues depends on the degree to which uptake of microplastics and translocation and redistribution and retention within other body tissues occurs. This concept is discussed further below, in relation to human ingestion. In addition to the potential for ingestion to cause adverse biological effects due to gut blockages and/or damage, or the reduction in energy assimilation (Wright et al. 2013), the large surface area of microplastics means that environmental pollutants may sorb to the surface of the particles, with the potential to be transferred into body tissues once ingested. For a more comprehensive coverage of the uptake of microplastics by wildlife organisms, and the transfer to tissues of hydrophobic pollutants adsorbed from the surrounding environment, the reader is referred to excellent recent reviews (e.g. Engler 2012) and to other chapters in this issue (Koelmans 2015; Lusher 2015). Despite this concern, there is currently no available information to evidence the uptake or biological effects of microplastics originating from marine or terrestrial debris and subsequently ingested by humans through the food chain."
73,899,0.271,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Abstract In this chapter we take a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating planning for coastal development, particularly in peri-urban areas. We consider ecosystem services and disservices and how, in the past, much development was at the expense of coastal wetlands. We then focus on mosquito production as a wetland related disservice that affects residents and imposes costs on individuals and government from both a health and management perspective. Most coastal peri-urban areas including adjacent wetland sites retain legacy infrastructures and landforms that degrade wetland function and often exacerbate the mosquito hazard. Rehabilitating coastal wetlands can improve wetland function while also reducing the mosquito hazard. Yet examination of rehabilitation and mosquito management within the existing planning framework found deï¬ciencies and complexity. In particular, coastal wetlands are almost always overlaid with a number of different zone and ownership boundaries that increase complexity of both mosquito management and wetland rehabilitation actions.

Solitary Cnidaria (sea fans, sea pens, anemones) are salient sessile members of the megafauna. Sea fans occur on small tar pillows on the Shenzi (oil and gas) field but not on soft mud nearby (Williamson et al. 2008). MacDonald et al. (2004) observed them associated with asphalt volcanism in the Campeche Knolls in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Trawl surveys in the northern margin of the deep Gulf of Mexico have noted that large anemones occur most frequently associated with submarine canyons and are especially common in the De Soto Canyon (Ammons and Daly 2008). It should be noted that these sessile organisms are all filter feeders that depend on a rain of detritus for nutrition, thus limiting their distributions to locations where a nutritional POC source is available. For food, they may also depend on horizontal or depth-contour controlled bottom currents to supply them with organic particulate material. As illustrated in Figure 7.68, the echinoderms are an important component of the deep megafauna. Within this diverse phylum, the holothuroids (sea cucumbers) appear to be the most widely distributed in the deep Gulf of Mexico, with a prominent MDM. However, they are difficult to sample. This is suspected because of trawling and multishot seafloor photography in the same locations of the seafloor. For example, photographs of a species of Peniagone sp. illustrated that it maintained a density of about 160,000 individuals per hectare (10,000 m2 or 107,640 ft2). The mean length of this species in these photographs was about 2.75 cm, or just over an inch. But individuals of this species were never captured in the trawls at the same location and time. Many holothuroids are more or less neutrally buoyant and thus it was thought that these individuals were not captured because they were pushed or swept away by the trawlâs bow wave. Many species of holothuroid are known to be able to swim or drift slowly over the deep seafloor. This information is contained in the Northern Gulf of Mexico Continental Slope Study Annual Report, Year 3, Vol II, Technical Report (Gallaway et al. 1988). This preliminary report is a font of knowledge that is not found in the final report (Pequegnat 1983) or a lone published summary of the work (Pequegnat et al. 1990). According to Ziegler (2002), the invertebrate megafauna densities of the continental slope and abyssal plain of the Gulf of Mexico are one to two orders of magnitude less than equivalent depths in other studies at higher latitudes (Rowe and Menzies 1969; Ohta 1983; Lampitt et al. 1986; Mayer and Piepenburg 1996). This supports the suggestion that in general the Gulf of Mexico is oligotrophic (Smith and Hinga 1983), based on low densities and biomass of macrobenthos (see above section on macrofauna), but this generalization ignores the numerous slope assemblages supported by fossil hydrocarbons or the fauna in the Mississippi and De Soto canyons. While this generalization may apply to the open continental slope and the abyssal plain, it may not apply to exceptional habitats such as seeps and canyons where food supplies are enhanced."
38,561,0.27,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.2.1 Kenya Northern Kenya is a region of high biodiversity conservation value. It is a hotspot of mammalian diversity in Africa and is critical habitat for several endangered and threatened large mammal species. This region is largely under tribal communal tenure, and the rich flora and fauna of the region are threatened by heavy and continuous grazing by domestic livestock, which has caused moderate to severe land degradation over large areas (Georgiadis et al. 2007). Several NGOs, the largest of which is the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), have been working to promote wildlife conservation and better land stewardship in this region. In 2008, NRT and other scientists developed a simple protocol useable by community members to monitor rangeland condition, which, in turn, determines the amount and quality of forage for wildlife. These methods were based upon pastoralistsâ traditional knowledge and monitoring practices that were also be scientiï¬cally defensible. Through a series of conversations at which the NGOs, scientists, and community members were present, all participants agreed that the indicators currently used by pastoralists to make management decisions were insufï¬cient, as they were largely focused on livestock condition and grass conditions affected by rainfall. All agreed that a new protocol was needed to capture information about long-term (>3 year) trends in rangeland functionality. However, these methods would need to be simple so that they could be learned and used by community members with low literacy. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID-East Africa), a team of scientiï¬c experts was assembled, as well as a diverse advisory panel, to guide this project. This team conducted focus group interviews with community members representing the Maasai, Samburu, Borana, Afar, and Karyu ethnic groups in Kenya and Ethiopia. In these interviews, researchers asked community members to describe the changes in their rangelands they had observed over the last several decades. The responses were markedly similar across diverse social and ecological contexts: increased bare ground, decreased perennial grasses, increased woody vegetation, and increased soil erosion. These observations also matched the general indicators of degradation that have been observed by scientists working in rangelands around the world. Researchers then used this traditional knowledge to adapt an existing set of rangeland monitoring methods (originally developed and thoroughly tested in the western United States) for the East African context. Notably, the US methods were simpliï¬ed by basing them on a stick 1 m long (rather than measuring tapes or other manufactured tools) and created a single graphical data sheet on which data could be collected by circling icons. The intent was that these methods could be used by people who could not read or write but could count and recognise simple icons (e.g., a picture of a shrub representing a sample point with shrub cover)."

Ultimately, it depends on the actions of governments and/or private businesses whether opportunities that arise from chances or shocks are effectively used. For example, the oil price crisis of 1973 induced the government of Brazil to establish a National Alcohol Program in 1975, which subsequently played an important role in the development of Brazilâs sugar-based bioeconomy (cf. Scheiterle et al. 2017).

222,122,0.27,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"In the period of this research, the SDGs have been developed and adopted globally as development targets for 2030 (UN 2015). They comprise a set of 17 âGlobal Goalsâ with 169 targets between them and are encouraging global activity on how to achieve and how to measure these achievements (Szabo et al. 2016), including in Bangladesh. The SDGs have essential and ambitious targets that are important today. This is reflected in the short timescale aiming to achieve most of these goals by 2030. However, 2030 is too close to experience significant climate and environmental changes, and therefore, the long-term needs for adaptation are not explicitly embedded in the SDGs. While not designed explicitly to support the SDGs, the approaches described in this book have great potential in this regard. In particular they can provide interdisciplinary insights on several SDGs and consider both short-term and long-term trends and their context. This was discussed and supported in a two-day meeting presenting the results in this book, held at the Royal Society, London in November 2016. These approaches already provide a wide range of indicators across the societal and environmental domains, which may be more suitable than many simple measured indicators used previously. Trends in river flows, sediment fluxes and coastal salinity are three relevant trends discussed in this book that relate to various SDGs, and especially SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation). Furthermore, the methods are flexible and can be developed and targeted as required."
241,282,0.27,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The wind climate, described through the statistics of nearsurface wind speed and direction, has a strong impact on human activities and the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Extreme wind speeds are a direct threat to life and property and an indirect threat through wind waves, storm surges (Chap. 9) and coastal erosion (Chap. 20) leading to high economic loss. However, on the European scale at least, no trends were found for storm losses adjusted for inflation and changes in population and wealth in the period 1970â2008 (Barredo 2010). Nilsson et al. (2004) calculated a storm damage index for Sweden for the period 1901â2000 based on storms sufï¬cient to cause forest damage. Although the 1980s suffered most extreme storm events in terms of windthrow, the authors noted several factors other than wind that increased or decreased storm damage. Widespread and severe damage usually relates to severe winter storms. A positive NAO index is generally associated with an increased number of extreme cyclones although they can also occur at negative phases of the NAO (Pinto et al. 2009). Among others, typical examples of severe winter storms causing widespread damage in the last decade have been Gudrun/Erwin on 8/9 January 2005 (HaanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al. 2006; Suursaar et al. 2006) and Kyrill on 18/19 January 2007 (Fink et al. 2009).

For example, the negative outcomes of climate change and ozonelayer depletion will become more substantial for the next generations (Dentener et al. 2006), and the extinction of species as well as the decline of certain natural habitats including forests and oceans cannot be fully rectified in the future. In a similar vein, a deteriorating communal environment may hinder individuals from meeting their need for competence due to its impact on the next generationâs well-being. As an example, family disruption harms the well-being of children and grandchildren in impacted families (Amato 2005). To the degree that individuals ascribe such negative outcomes to their own or their societyâs failure to preserve natural and communal environments, their need for competence will be unsatisfied and their sensitivity to opportunities that maintain the environment will increase. Deteriorating natural and communal environments also negatively affect peopleâs need for relatedness (i.e., their need to connect with others) (Ryan and Deci 2000). First, declining environmental conditions that will primarily harm the subsequent generation are likely to make it more challenging for individuals to develop relationships with people in that generation. For instance, children may blame their parents (or the generation of their grandparents) for leading self-centered and egoistical lives that exploited and damaged nature and for causing problems that the children and their generation will have to endure. Second, a deteriorating natural environment generally causes unequal suffering among the earthâs population; often, the individuals who suffer most did not cause the decline, thus making it challenging for both groups of people to connect. Ozone-layer depletion, global warming, and overfishing, for instance, can largely be attributed to industrial activities and use in developed regions and countries, yet the numerous and often significant costs of these activities in the form of destroyed ecosystems are forced on developing countries (Srinivasan et al. 2008). In turn, individuals from these developing countries may reproach the developed countries for their self-centeredness and irresponsibility, thus harming interpersonal relationship building across different societies. Third, weakened communal environments can disturb salient social relationships, for example, between parents and their children when families are disrupted. With more struggles and relationship issues, peopleâs need for relatedness is unmet. In this case, they are likely to focus on"

One of thoseâthe SelfHelp Group (SHG) programâcompetes directly with microfinance. Despite the suspect source, the stories of abuse proved hard to completely dismiss. An organization that helps administer Andhra Pradeshâs SHG program compiled a list of 54 allegedly microcredit-linked suicides (SERP 2010). Bereaved family members told their stories to reporters, who captured them on video.11 Allegations also emerged of loan officers visiting the homes of defaulters and publicly haranguing them to shame them into repaying. Suicides were evidently so rare among microcredit clients (a reported 54 out of millions) that the small loans may have prevented as many deaths as they caused, by giving a handful of cornered people a way to go on; but their stories will never be told on TV. Nonetheless, the stories of multiple borrowing, abusive collection practices, and frenetic growth of microcreditors taken over by investors looking for a quick exit were all signs that something had indeed gone seriously wrong in Indian microcredit. That belief appears shared by a majority of the microfinance industry, even SKS founder Vikram Akula (Hanna 2012). What then do the suicides signify for microfinance? The combination of easy offers of credit and tough demands for repayment, enforced through public embarrassment of group meetings, probably put many Indians in a tough spotâperhaps only the minority of all borrowers, but far more than 54. The likely difficulties of this larger but less well-defined group cannot be dismissed as regrettable rarities. 3.4 Bubble Troubles The boom and bust in Andhra Pradesh did not follow the storyline of a classic bubbleâone that implodes under its own weightâbecause the crash was brought about by sudden government action. Nevertheless, growth that in retrospect appears dangerously rapid, on the order of 100 % per year, is an important element of the story. And Andhra Pradesh is not unique in this respect. Experts at CGAP documented and analyzed similar reversals in 2008â09 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Morocco, Nicaragua, and the Punjab region of Pakistan (Chen, Rasmussen, and Reille 2010). Each case is distinctive in certain respects. Politics was a major factor in Nicargua, for example, as President Daniel Ortega endorsed the no pago movement. Ripples from the global financial crisis also may have hurt repayment rates. Yet the authors judged these three common threads to be primary: 1. Concentrated market competition and multiple borrowing. 2. Overstretched MFI systems and controls. 3. Erosion of MFI lending discipline."

It is unclear whether reduced visitation was due to mortality of bees, a repellent effect of the treated foliage, or, if the lack of bees returning to the hive to communicate the location of the food resource in the treated area lead to a shift in foraging to areas from which bees did return. Laboratory bioassays with this field-treated foliage killed 100% of exposed bees for 3 d. Unfortunately the concentration of CPY per unit of surface area was not determined. Results were similar but less severe at lesser concentrations of Dursban. No dead bees were found at the colonies when Dursban was applied at 0.28 kg haâ1 in the morning, although visitations on the field were moderately depressed for 2 d. Bioassays of foliage aged for 12 h from this treatment killed 100% of bees, and showed 0â31% kill on foliage aged 48â96 h (Atkins et al. 1973). A number of field trials examining mortality and visitation to flowers in alfalfa, raspberry, dandelion, carrot, and corn were reported by Lunden et al. (1986). In field tests on alfalfa in Washington State, Lorsban 4E was applied by aircraft at 1.12 kg CPY haâ1 to several 0.4â0.8 ha plots in the evening (19:00â21:00 h). Each location contained two honey bee colonies and three nesting boards with alfalfa leafcutting bees adjacent to the crop. Mortality of honey bees in the treated plots was five-to eight-fold higher than in controls. A 56â67% reduction in nesting along with reductions in visits to flowers of up to 100% was reported for alfalfa leafcutting bees. The authors concluded that âlow-rangeâ honey bee kills occurred (100â200 dead bees per day on an apron in front of a hive), but colonies did not die. Leafcutting bees, which do not have multiple generations per year, would suffer more. It was also suggested that application of CPY to blooming alfalfa would seriously reduce seed set in crops grown for seed. Lorsban 4E applied to single 0.004 ha plots of dandelions in pear and apple orchards at 1.12 kg CPY haâ1 caused no reductions in the number of honey bees foraging and no effects on behavior (Lunden et al. 1986). When Lorsban 50 WP (1.68 kg CPY haâ1) was applied by ground-sprayer to raspberry plots in the evening (Lunden et al. 1986), bees behaved erratically after foraging on blossoms 1 d after treatment, in that they would âmill around, land on leaves and walk in a wobbly fashionâ. Visitation to flowers was 40% of that observed in the control on d-1 and remained reduced for 7 d. Bioassays conducted in cages with 3-d-old foliage resulted in 70% mortality of honey bees after 24 h. Chlorpyrifos is no longer registered for use on raspberries. Lorsban 50 W applied to a single, blooming carrot field (8.1 ha) at 1.12 kg CPY haâ1 containing adjacent honey bee hives resulted in over 12-fold more dead bees and reduced foraging on the crop the day after application, and threefold more dead bees 2 d after application. The actual number of bees lost was considered to be only a moderate honey bee kill (250â500 dead bees per hive from an Apron type dead bee trap or 500â950 from a Todd type dead bee trap) based on criteria of Mayer and Johansen (1983), and the long-term viability of the hive was not affected (Lunden et al. 1986). In an unreplicated corn field with adjacent honey bee hives, application of CPY resulted in four-fold more dead bees and 95% reduced foraging on corn pollen compared to pre-application counts (Lunden et al. 1986). It is unclear whether there was an overall reduction in foraging, or whether bees simply avoided the CPYtreated plots. Impacts on long-term survival of the hives were not reported."

Advances in mechanistic modeling of aquatic ecosystems have resulted in our ability to include greater process (especially trophic) detail and complexity, as well as to perform dynamic simulations. Still, mechanistic ecosystem models have not advanced to the point of being able to predict community structure or biotic integrity. In this chapter, only some of the simpler mechanistic models will be introduced. More detail can be found in books solely devoted to water quality modeling (Chapra and Reckhow 1983; Chapra 1997; McCutcheon 1989; Thomann and Mueller 1987; Orlob 1983; Schnoor 1996) as well as the current literature."

This species-specific variability in the intermediate degree of urbanisation (Ï2 = 7.74) accounted for 21 % of the variability in the areas with high urban development (Ï2 = 9.80). This suggests that although intermediate urban development clearly has a negative influence on bats it still permits the use of this habitat by more species showing fewer extremes in the species-specific response to urbanisation, compared to high urban development."

Also, nature has significant influence on humans, for example by providing restorative settings, for educational purposes, offering inspiration and promoting creativity. The provision of these services to humans by nature has been captured in the concept of ESS. Thus, ESS is basically a categorization of the broad range of âbenefits people obtain from ecosystemsâ (MEA 2005:V). The concept emerged in the late 1970s when ecosystem functions beneficial to humans where termed as âservicesâ in order to raise public awareness for biodiversity conservation (GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. 2010). Since then, the literature on ecosystem services has strongly expanded, which has also led to a rich debate on the concept, with particular emphasis on methods for assessment and valuation of ecosystem services, but also addressing ethical issues and how the concept can be mainstreamed into policy making (e.g., Cowling et al. 2008, Thompson 2008, Norgaard 2010, Vierikko and Niemela 2016). The United Nations led Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report was a milestone with regard to the latter, as it represented the first ever global assessment of ecosystem services to policy makers."

Hence, the focus shifts to understanding how ecosystem services can reduce particular types of poverty for specific groups of people over different timescales. Rural livelihoods are diverse over space and time, and populations rely on more than one provisioning ecosystem service for their income. Ecosystem services commonly occur in bundles (sets of services that repeatedly appear together) and as such certain groups of services are more accessible than others. The adoption of a social-ecological system approach allows diversification of ecosystem service use to be considered, including being dependent on a subsidiary service in a particular zone (e.g. fishing in an agricultural area) (Sect. 2.2.1). Thus, the probability of being poor varies in space with the available bundles of ecosystem services and proximity to certain geographical features such as the coast or major rivers, or access to roads and cities. The ability of ecosystem services to create well-being is dynamic and path dependent. Current productivity is a result of policy decisions made regarding infrastructure (e.g. coastal embankments) and the prioritisation"

The most prominent coronavirus, the one causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was followed by a pandemic spread in humans after the first outbreak in China in 2002 (Rota et al. 2003). Soon after the outbreak, the virus was detected in masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in a market in Guangdong Province, where SARS was first reported (Guan et al. 2003). A survey of common wildlife species in the area identified bats to be the natural reservoir of SARS coronavirus, with viruses from bats showing greater genetic diversity than the ones isolated from other species, including humans (Li et al. 2005). Bats can regularly be found in markets in China, which makes direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans likely (Li et al. 2005).

However, there is no obligation to compensate for loss of ecosystem services; consequently, the farmer does not pay for the damage that he or she inflicts on the owner of the water body. Similarly, there is no requirement for the owner of the water body to pay the farmer (as the owner of the land) if he or she abstains from using chemical fertilizers (the absence of which could inhibit the farmerâs production). As shown in Table 10.1, human activities such as use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides, and conversion of agricultural land for human settlements, can generate ecological risks. These include poor soil quality, water pollution, and food insecurity resulting from reduced ecosystem services, especially provisioning services. In Indonesia serious land use changes occur as a result of rapid expansion of oil palm plantations that replace ecologically valuable tropical rainforest and mangrove. This is a situation in which human action causes CO2 emission responsible for climate change and global warming. Furthermore, clearance and draining of peatland enhances fire and causes carbon stock to emit CO2 into the atmosphere. Although the countryâs economic development is essential, therefore, the ecological risks associated with the development are pervasive."

284,200,0.269,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction Mining activity has undeniable environmental impacts due to the nature of its operations, processing plants and foundries. Mining companies proclaim their environmental responsibility by implementing policies that limit environmental risk and impact, while also applying new technologies and production processes that are more respectful of the environment. The degree of efï¬cacy of these sustainability measures and the degree to which companies voluntarily ensure environmental care cannot belie the fact that â no matter what â mining activity has and will always have environmental impacts. There are two major points of view about the subject, according to Whitmore (2006). On the one hand, there are the views of companies â that is to say, the actors who control the mining bulldozers and claim to ensure that everything goes well and that mining is, or can be, sustainable. On the other hand, there are the views of those who are affected by mining activity, such as the communities, peasants and indigenous peoples who are displaced without proper consultation, who suffer illnesses, and whose lifestyles, health and environment are impacted. This chapter will not address the mining problem from the conventional perspective of whether or not mining is sustainable. The majority of the socioenvironmental conï¬icts that arise around mining are focused on this problem.1 We refer to the fact that mining consumes large quantities of water and energy and is one of the most widespread productive activities. As AngloGold Ashantiâs sustainability report declares,2 mining activity has a direct impact on the environment"
73,565,0.269,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"whilst imperfect, the Cuban program met with notable (if unintended) successes in public and environmental health. Prior to the Special Period of crisis and disruption in the Cuban food system, Cuban dietary habits were poor with high consumption of sugar, animal fats, and rice, and low consumption of a very limited range of fruits and vegetables (Wright 2009). Environmental and public health impacts from the industrial agricultural system included chemical pesticide and fertiliser residue and increased mortality rates (Wright 2009). The food system was ï¬awed, and the Cuban government acknowledged the ï¬aws. It took the Special Period oil crisis, however, to move from knowledge to change. If pragmatism advocates for learning via experimentation and experience of what works, it is apparent from what occurred in Cuba that this knowledge alone is unlikely to be enough to instigate change. Blomleyâs discussion of performativity theory (2013) points to failure and crisis in the (ï¬awed) dominant model as an entry point for alternatives. The post-Special Period food system reforms in Cuba involved extensive revisions of property rights. (This should be read, of course, from the perspective that Cuba is a socialist state with a fundamentally different political system than that of Australia.) At a rural level, the most signiï¬cant reform was the breakup of large state farms into unidades basicas de produccion cooperativas (UBPCs), small farming cooperatives located on the peri-urban fringe and run autonomously by groups of farmers (Gropas 2006). Under this scheme worker collectives were granted leases, rent-free, over state farm lands in permanent usufruct together with ownership of the goods produced (Deere et al. 1994). Within the cities, two key features of the Cuban program are the organoponicos and the mercados agropecuarios. The organoponicos are raised-bed intensiveproduction gardens located on public land (Viljoen and Howe 2005). The produce from the organoponicos and other sources is retailed directly to consumers via the mercados agropecuarios, local farmersâ markets in the city (Premat 2009). The Cuban program has separately promoted urban and peri-urban agriculture. The Agricultura Urbana program initiated in the 1990s concentrated on âpatios (domestic gardens), plots (empty lots planted to vegetables) andâ¦ organoponicos â low-walled beds ï¬lled with soil and organic matter, with or without drip irrigationâ (Hagelberg 2010).

Cubans were encouraged to use every possible urban space for food production. Private gardens and rooftops (patios) were transformed into spaces for chicken coops, pig sties, goat sheds, and vegetable gardens (Premat 2009). A separate and distinct program, Agricultura Suburbana, was implemented in peri-urban regions, on fincas (small farms) in âan eight-kilometre-deep ring between two and ten kilometres from urban centersâ (Hagelberg 2010). These programs were implemented in great haste in response to the acute food security crisis.

308,370,0.269,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Introduction The diagnosis of death is, in most countries, the legal responsibility of a medical practitioner. It marks a point in time after which consequences occur including no medical or legal requirement to provide resuscitation or life-sustaining technologies, loss of personhood, and most individual rights, the opportunity for organ donation and autopsy proceedings, execution of the decedentâs legal will, estate and property transfer, payment of life insurance, ï¬nal disposition of the body and, of course, religious, or social ceremonies to mark the end of a life [1]. A deï¬nition of death, just like a deï¬nition of life, continues to elude philosophers. Death can be considered in terms of medical, legal, ethical, philosophical, societal, cultural, and religious rationales. The medical deï¬nition of death is primarily a scientiï¬c issue based on the best available evidence [2]."
77,300,0.269,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Comparing Groups Although the analysis of the development over time is of great interest, researchers are often interested in dividing the cohort under study into groups of subjects with comparable developmental trajectories; firstly as a tool to describe the population under study and, secondly as a first step to study either determinants or consequences of different trajectories. The possibility to divide the cohort under study within MM, however, is limited and only allows for the grouping of subjects into (predefined) categories such as gender. Categorisation into these predefined categories thus results in average health trajectories for each category, mostly assuming that each male or female has a similar health trajectory (shape). To do so, the interaction between the time variable and the group variable must be added to the model. Adding random slopes to predefined categories to the model makes it possible to model some heterogeneity within each category. However, this is not often done in practice, mainly because many software packages are not capable of performing such analyses. Table 9.2 shows the results of the MM analyses comparing the development over time between males and females. The interpretation of the numbers is exactly as has been given for the total population. All differences in development over time between males and females were statistically significant. Although MM can allow for heterogeneity in health trajectory (shape) through the inclusion of random slopes, they only allow for the a-priori selection of subgroups of subjects. LCGM, on the other hand, relies on the data to generate latent subgroups of subjects with different health trajectories over time and consequently, potentially differential risks of disease. The application of such a âgroup-basedâ approach, as opposed to the traditional âclassification-basedâ approach where subjects are classified into predefined groups is interesting for life course researchers too, because it allows the unravelling of distinct trajectories throughout the life course including their determinants and consequences and allows for the identification of high-risk subjects, who may need supplementary treatment or monitoring over the life course. Moreover, such an approach can also allow the subsequent identification of low-risk subjects who might need less attention. There are several statistical techniques available to study heterogeneity in developmental trajectories using the data to form the groups; the most commonly"

32,212,0.269,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Social Modeling and Simulation, plus Econophysics Colloquium 2014","Therefore the robustness of the entire system is a function of mE, not the bare E. And because NE D 1 means that the average number of extinctions balances with the number of inclusions in the long time average, that corresponds to the transition point of the growth behavior. In other words, the following self-consistent condition should be satisfied for the critical number of interactions per species: m E.m / D 1. Let us now focus on the relevant parameter in the argument p above, mE. We find that the decrease of E is slower than 1=m (roughly  1= m). Therefore mE is a sub-linearly increasing function of m, and it crosses the critical value 1 around m D 13. This means that the mean-filed treatment can explain the transition in the growth behavior of the system. In addition, this theory give us the simple understanding of the transition mechanism. It originates from the balance of the two effects: although having more interactions makes each species robust against the disturbances (addition and extinction of the species relating to that species), it also increases the impact of the loss of a species. In consistent with this success in explaining the transition by the mean-field analysis, we can find essentially same phase diagram in slightly modified models, such as the model with giving a randomly distributed degrees for the newly added species, the one with different distribution functions for the link weights, and so on [11]. In the classical diversity-stability relation based on the linear stability of dynamical systems, an intrinsic stability is assumed for each element to ensure the stability of each element when that has no interactions. For the system to remain stable, each element may have essentially only one interaction that is not weak comparing to the given intrinsic stability [2]. In the present mechanism, we do not assume any kind of intrinsic stability to the elements: an element with no interaction immediately goes extinct. Even so, the system with 10 or more interactions per element can grow. In this sense, the condition we have identified is very realistic. Indeed in the real systems, it is quite often to find moderately sparse networks: the average degree is in the order of 10, not order of 1, and that seems not dependent on the system size. This novel relation between the connection in the system and its robustness might be a origin of this."

This distance to the cage and the resulting current velocity was calculated by using a corresponding situation as it occurs at the offshore site. After starting the experiment ï¬sh behaviour, escape response, welfare, and reaction at feeding were recorded using an underwater video camera. The results of these investigations show a strong impact of strong current velocities on farmed turbot within the cage. Juvenile turbot are unharmed at velocities of 0â1.0 ms-1. However, the ï¬sh are affected by stronger currents in a way that the ï¬sh will be transferred from their resting area on the bottom of the cage resulting in more activity of the ï¬sh swimming against the current trying to resettle on the bottom. At very strong current velocities of 1.5 ms-1 and higher it might happen that young turbots are pressed against the net of the cage leading to the risk to obtain skin injuries. To summarize, these results show that turbot cultivation offshore is not suitable if current velocities exceed a certain value, making a site-selection-criteria process necessary. However, we have to take into account that we used small ï¬shâthe model organismâin the experiment, which allowed the upscaling to a size corresponding with real ï¬sh sizes to be farmed at offshore sites. As ï¬sh in a size we used in this investigation will never be transferred to offshore sites as it is described in this book we assume that larger ï¬sh, which normally will be cultured in offshore cages, will act differently."

Albeit the final loss might be the same (and also the bankâs costs for loan workout), in the case of the micro-borrowers more bank staff gets involved, the failure will be related to media coverage about the natural disaster, there will be political activities around the flooding, et cetera.

We also use the conservation priority method HEDGE (Heightened EDGE), which like EDGE measure evolutionary distinctiveness by IUCN levels of extinction but additionally considers how future extinction of species will affect the evolutionary distinctiveness of remaining species. In sum, HEDGE estimates the expected terminal branch length of the focal species in light of future extinction risk (Steel et al. 2007). Both conservation methods generate ï¬xed probabilities of extinction as described in Table 1. For more information on how IUCN levels of imperilments are transformed into probabilities of extinction see Moores et al. (2008). Because there are not estimated probabilities of extinction available for data deï¬cient species we arbitrarily assigned an extinction risk score in between the two lowest IUCN extinction categories: least concern and near threatened (Table 1). All four metrics were calculated using both ârawâ branch lengths (estimated by MrBayes) as they contain information on the unique evolutionary information of terminal taxa and ultrametrized trees. Furthermore, with the purpose of comparing this approach to identify conservation priority areas with other commonly used conservation prioritization criteria we calculated evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) (Isaac et al. 2007) also implemented in the TUATARA module and gathered information on species richness. To identify conservation priority areas (CPAs) we used distribution range maps from the IUCN spatial database (2013) as a baseline to produce species richness, ED, EDGE and HEDGE maps, under both IUCN extinction probabilities transformation methods, pessimistic and IUCN50. The IUCN spatial database depict speciesâ range distribution as polygons based on the extent of occurrence, which is deï¬ned as the area contained within a minimum convex hull around speciesâ observations or records. This convex hull or polygon is further improved by including areas known to be suitable or by removing unsuitable or unoccupied areas based on expert knowledge. For each species the distribution range was converted to a grid system with cells of 5â² Ã 5â² (approximately 10 Ã 10 km at the Equator line). This spatial resolution was selected for its practical compromise between intensive computing and a reasonable representation of geographic patterns. Traditionally, a one-degree cell (100 Ã 100 km) has been used in macroecological analyses, but there is no ecological reason behind"
36,137,0.268,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"4.6 Genetic Consequences Tropical taxa are generally underrepresented in landscape genetic studies (Storfer et al. 2010). Bats are no exception, as only few studies have assessed how they are affected by anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation at the genetic level (Fig. 4.3b). Meyer et al. (2009) studied populations of two Neotropical bats in fragments that were isolated by a water matrix and detected significant population differentiation that matched the speciesâ relative mobility. In contrast to the more mobile canopy frugivore, Uroderma bilobatum, population subdivision in the understory frugivore, C. perspicillata, showed a significant effect of fragmentation and isolation by distance, as well as reduced genetic diversity on islands relative to mainland populations. Also employing mitochondrial DNA sequence data, Ripperger et al. (2013) documented small-scale genetic differentiation for another small understory frugivore, Dermanura watsoni, in fragments embedded in a matrix dominated by agriculture. Landscape connectivity as measured by the amount of suitable habitat surrounding forest patches was most strongly correlated with genetic variation when quantified within small-scale (400 m) landscape buffers, likely reflecting the reduced mobility of this species. Importantly, empirical levels of genetic diversity in fragments were best explained by past rather than present habitat conditions. Because anthropogenic habitat fragmentation is recent on evolutionary timescales, populations may not show immediate genetic responses to fragmentation, highlighting the importance of considering time lags in these scenarios. In a microsatellite study of three codistributed insectivorous bat species in forest fragments in peninsular Malaysia, Struebig et al. (2011) observed area-related declines in genetic diversity in Kerivoula papillosa, the species that was most sensitive to fragmentation based on ecological characteristics (low vagility, low population density, tree-cavity-roosting habit). Based on the genetic-area relationship observed for K. papillosa, the authors estimated that preserving the genetic diversity of this species at levels similar to those of intact forest would require extensive areas (>10,000 ha), several times larger than necessary to maintain comparable levels of species richness. In view of the fact that most forest patches in heavily fragmented production landscapes across Southeast Asia are much smaller, it is evident that maintaining genetic diversity of the dozens of forest specialist species that exhibit trait combinations similar to those of K. papillosa constitutes a substantial conservation challenge (Struebig et al. 2011). Roosting ecology and social organization may generally be important predictors of genetic structuring in insectivorous Old World bats. Rossiter et al. (2012) found that less vagile, treeroosting species exhibit reduced gene flow, even across continuous intact rain forest, compared to more wide-ranging colonial cave-roosting species, indicating that the former should be disproportionately affected by landscape-scale habitat fragmentation. Only weak genetic population subdivision was demonstrated for Artibeus lituratus, an abundant, highly mobile, and generalist frugivore, in a study in"

In what is known as the environmental impact of products from its cradle to its grave, impact categories of a product and the corresponding indicators and model(s) are identiï¬ed (Reap et al. 2008). The impact results are then grouped into different categories (Ibid). Despite its popularity of LCA and codiï¬cation in the International Standardization Organization, LCA has a number of weaknesses (ibid.). There is no consensus on types of stressors, impacts, the models to use and corresponding indicators under consideration (ibid). Like TEV, double counting remains a major problem of LCA (ibid). Due to these problems and given that TEV methods also trace the on-site and off-site impacts of the ecosystem services, the studies in this book will use the TEV approach. Many of the services provided by ecosystems are not traded in markets, so the different actors do not pay for negative or positive effects on those ecosystems. The value of such externalities may not be considered in the farmerâs land use decision, which leads to an undervaluation of land and its provision of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services should be considered as capital assets, or natural capital (Daily et al. 2011; Barbier 2011c). This natural capital should be properly valuated and managed as any other form of capital assets (Daily et al. 2000). The failure to capture these values for land ecosystems could lead to undervaluing the impact of higher rates of land degradation. To adequately account for ecosystem services in decision making, the economic values of those services have to be determined. There exist various methods to evaluate ecosystem services (Barbier 2010, 2011a, b; Nkonya et al. 2011). However, attributing economic values to ecosystem services is challenging, due to many unknowns and actual measurement constraints. The valuation of the natural capital, therefore, should follow three stages (Daily et al. 2000): (i) evaluation of alternative options, for example, degrading soil ecosystem services versus their sustainable management, (ii) measurement and identiï¬cation of costs and beneï¬ts for each alternative, and (iii) comparison of costs and beneï¬ts of each of the alternatives including their long-term effects (ibid.). However, identifying and aggregating individual preferences and attached values to ecosystem services, including over time, for each alternative option, is not a straightforward task (ibid.) As economic values are linked to the number of (human) beneï¬ciaries and the socioeconomic context, these services depend on local or regional conditions. This dependence contributes to the variability of the values (TEEB 2010). The green square box in Fig. 2.1 deals with the economic analysis to be carried out, and the green arrow shows the flow of information that is necessary to perform the different elements of the global economic analysis. Ideally, all indirect and off-site effects should be accounted for in the economic analysis to ensure that the assessment is from societyâs point of view and includes all existing externalities, in addition to the private costs that are usually considered when individuals decide on land use. This assessment has to be conducted at the margin, which means that costs of small changes in the level of land degradation, which may accumulate over time, have to be identiï¬ed. Bringing together the different cost and value types to fully assess total costs and beneï¬ts over time and their interactions can be done within the framework of costâbeneï¬t analysis and mathematical modeling. In doing this, care should be taken in the choice of the discount rates because the size of the"

376,460,0.268,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The SES framework was used to understand factors that impeded the use of herbaceous broad-leaved plants, or forbs, in restoration of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invaded Great Basin sagebrush steppe ecosystems of the western USA. Most of these ecosystems are managed by federal agencies, in particular the Bureau of Land Management. Forbs are an important component of biodiversity in these ecosystems (West 1993) and increasing native forb species richness can enhance resistance to invasive plants (Pokorny et al. 2005) including cheatgrass. By providing fine-textured, combustible fuels, cheatgrass increases susceptibility to wildfires, and wildfires have been growing in frequency and severity across the Great Basin (Brooks et al. 2004), a trend that is expected to continue as a result of climate change (Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011). Yet when rangeland managers choose seed mixes for restoring native plant communities after a wildfire, forbs are often underutilized. While reduced forb abundance after wildfires is a local- to regional-scale ecological issue, applying an SES framework revealed that it stems partly from higher level processes that affect agency budget choices, as well as individual variation in how managers perceive and interpret scientific information about rangelands and climate change. The SES framework accounts for factors, relationships, and feedbacks among scales that influence the relationship between forb restoration, climate change, invasive plants, and manager decision making. An SES-based analysis of key drivers of manager decision making helped to understand the limitations to the adaptive capacity of managers. Land managers may know which plant species to reseed after wildfire to suit past conditions, but predictions of future climate in these regions suggest more variable and extreme weather events, longer droughts, and increasing summer high temperatures (Ackerly et al. 2010; Polley et al. 2013). Part of this study was to evaluate the effect of summer warming on forbs to test the assumption that forb species choices for postfire rangeland seedings might need to be adapted to suit"
302,271,0.268,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Many species are able to identify particles with nutritional value. For example, some bacterivorous and herbivorous protozoan, rotifer, and copepod species do not ingest polymer particles in their preferred size ranges (Table 1). Studies with fluorescently labeled bacteria have shown that some ciliates (estuarine oligotrichs) and flagellates prefer bacteria over MPs, while other species (estuarine scuticociliates; e.g., Uronema narina) cannot discriminate between bacteria and MPs [32]. The essential role of âtasteâ in the feeding of zooplankton [14, 32, 33] was acknowledged when discussing the comparability of feeding studies with synthetic microspheres and labeled bacteria or algae [9, 10, 15]. In rotifers, Bosmina (cladoceran), and copepods (calanoid and cyclopoid), DeMott [14] observed significant differences between feeding rates on flavored and non-flavored polymer particles. While Bosmina and the rotifer Filinia terminalis preferred algal-flavored spheres over untreated ones, D. magna and Brachionus calyciflorus did not [14]. This degree of selectivity was even higher in feeding trials with copepods. Here, calanoid (e.g., Diaptomus siciloides) and cyclopoid (e.g., Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi) species strongly avoided untreated polymer spheres [14]. Despite the abundance of studies that illustrate pelagic zooplankton feeding on MPs, information about benthic invertebrates and vertebrates in general is scarce. Although drawing conclusions for unexamined species is highly speculative, knowledge on zooplankton can be used as a template to a certain extent. The examined species cover a broad spectrum in terms of their autecology (feeding types, selectivity, and food preferences). The same is true for the unexamined species, which inhabit similar niches and have equally diverse autecologies. Therefore, we hypothesize a similar pattern regarding species-specific size and taste discrimination: Some species will directly feed on available MPs in the size range of their food, while more selective feeders will avoid MP ingestion."
35,468,0.268,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Declining catches of Atlantic cod lead to a growing interest in aquaculture of this species. For more than thirty years, the intensive production of cod has been established (Moksness et al. 2004). The rearing of G. morhua requires the production of live food of different sizes and feeding protocols need to be followed strictly (Moksness et al. 2004). Of all the gadoid species, cod is thought to have the greatest potential for future development for aquaculture and some scientists believe that within the next 20 years similarly high production levels can be achieved as for the Atlantic salmon (Rosenlund and Skretting 2006). The suitability of G. morhua for offshore aquaculture has been successfully demonstrated in 3000 m3 submersible cages including automatic feeding buoys by the company Sea Stationâ¢ off the coast of New Hampshire (Chambers and Howell 2006). As G. morhua is a physoclist species, necessary pauses need to be included during vertical movements of the cage (KorsÃ¸en 2011). One major problem for cod aquaculture is their ability to bite through the mesh or other materials, which makes them the ï¬sh species with the highest escapee rate (Jensen et al. 2010), which could have a negative impact on wild population by cross-breeding (Davies et al. 2008). The extreme temperature tolerance range from â1 to 23 Â°C and an optimum temperature range from 8 to 12 Â°C (Jobling 1988) make this species a candidate for aquaculture in the German Bight. However, aquaculture companies should be aware that the relatively high summer temperatures in the German Bight could enhance the risk of infections, as G. morhua is prone to bacterial ï¬sh pathogens such as Franciscella spec. or Aeromonas salmonicidae at prolonged temperatures of more than 12 Â°C (Buck et al. 2012)."

A decrease is estimated for the northernmost European countries. Hedegaard et al. (2012) compared the 1990s with the 1890s and found climate-driven decreases in surface O3 in the North Sea region. However, the decrease is not statistically signiï¬cant over the region as a whole. Using an ensemble of global models, Silva et al. (2013) found the average number of premature annual deaths attributable to past (1850â2000) climate change in Europe to be 954 for O3 (respiratory) and 11,900 for PM2.5. But the magnitude and even the sign of the values varies between models. In a global study with one model, Fang et al. (2013) found a climate-driven contribution to cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality associated with industrial PM2.5 since 1860 of up to 14 % over Europe. Ozone was responsible for a small contribution. The calculation does not include the climate-driven effect on emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons."

77,211,0.268,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), is considered one of the most pressing public health concerns in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001). Although obesity rates have recently stabilized, the prevalence of obesity in the adult population increased for all sex and age groups between 1980 and 2010 (Flegal et al. 1998, 2010; Ogden et al. 2012). In the most recent data, 35.7 % of adults in the United Statesâover 78 million peopleâwere considered obese (Ogden et al. 2012). Since obesity is associated with a variety of health problems, most notably diabetes (Narayan et al. 2007), and with increased disability at older ages (Himes 2000), understanding the mechanisms by which subgroups of the population do and do not gain weight as they age is important. The obesity epidemic in the United States coincided with a substantial shift in menâs participation in the U.S. military. In the middle of the twentieth century, military service early in adulthood was a normative part of the life course for the majority of men in the United States (Hogan 1981). However, in 1973, the U.S. military ended conscription and moved into the current All-Volunteer Force era. Relative to the participation rates of men from early-twentieth-century birth cohorts, which peaked around 80 % for those who served during World War II (Hogan 1981), rates of military service among young adults in more recent cohorts have dropped substantially. Nevertheless, military service remains a salient pathway to adulthood for many young adults in the United States (Wilmoth and London 2013; Wolf et al. 2013). If military service influences weight and weight gain across the life course, then the passage of cohorts through the age structure during historical"

126,53,0.268,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"â¢ Widespread Ethiopian government expropriation of indigenous villagers for the establishment of irrigated commercial private and government plantations has been underway for at least ï¬ve years in both the higher altitude Mursi portion and the Dasanech/Nyangatom portion of the lower Omo basin. This process is documented by international human rights organizations for the traditional lands of the Mursi and their neighbors (Fig. 1.3). To the extent possible, SONT researchers have documented the expropriation process in the less accessible Dasanech (and Nyangatom) lands in the lowermost Omo basin (see Chaps. 7 and 8). Most of the Dasanech communities that have been expropriated from their traditional lands along the lowermost Omo have no option but to take refuge within (or nearby) the modern Omo delta. This involuntary movement into the delta region greatly worsens the already crowded conditions there for agropastoralists and ï¬shing communities already settled there.14 â¢ The Ethiopian government forces respond with repressive measuresâoften, with brutalityâwhen Dasanech or Nyangatom communities resist expropriation from their riverine lands. Fear among villagers throughout the region is intensifying. Such political repression and the GOEâs denial of residentsâ access to river waters essential to their survival constitute human rights violations, as deï¬ned by the United Nations and other international bodies. A culture of fear pervades villages throughout the region where communities are already desperately searching for a means of survival. The response of the Kenyan government (GOK) to the survival plight of indigenous pastoralists and ï¬shers around Lake Turkana indicates a predominant attitude of indifference. This view is reflected in World Bank statements in internal documents, for example, citing the high likelihood of the GOK âoverlookingâ impacts of lake retreat on its indigenous population in favor of Gibe III dam electricity generated that is contracted for export to that âpower deï¬citâ nation."

Ullio (2002) reported that from 1995 to 2000, fruit growers in NSW suffered an annual gross market value loss of AUD 10.4 million due to consumption by flying foxes. When taking into account the resulting loss to affiliated industries such as packaging, employment, transport and marketing, the overall financial loss was estimated to be around AUD 26 million annually. Prior to 1998, on the north coast of NSW, only stone fruit, lychee and persimmon were consistently eaten by flying foxes in significant quantities (Rogers 2002). Losses increased dramatically from 1998, particularly in orchards without netting. The stone fruit industry suffered a loss of AUD 4â6 million (not including preharvest costs, which usually exceed AUD 20,000). Sixty per cent of orchards without netting suffered losses of 50â100 %, around AUD 45,000 per grower. The mandarin industry reports losing at least 40 % of its annual crop, while in 2001, an individual lychee grower reported a loss of more than AUD 500,000 in the unnetted section of her orchard (Rogers 2002). Comensoli (2002) measured the damage caused by flying foxes to his nectarine (P. persica) orchard, estimating that 20 % of ripe fruit was damaged over a period of 19 days, reducing the annual profit from his entire crop by 16 %. In Queensland, orchardists also suffered particularly high crop damage in the summer of 1998. The estimated total loss for that season was approximately AUD 10 million (Teagle 2002), with some growers having lost up to 90 % of their crop (Dewhurst 1998). It should be noted, however, that the above estimates of orchard losses have not been verified and originate primarily from growers. Due to this perceived high economic loss, the Australian fruit industry considers species of Pteropus to be its main vertebrate crop pests (Ullio 2002). Yet it has been acknowledged, even among fruit growers, that increasing feeding by flying fox on commercial crops is due to the loss of natural food resources as the rainforests, heathland and Melaleuca swamps of Australiaâs eastern seaboard have been increasingly cleared for urban development (e.g. Bicknell 2002; Biel 2002; Gough 2002; Rogers 2002). As a result, Biel (2002) and Rogers (2002) proposed that fruit growers should be financially compensated for economic loss and that the wider community should also bear the cost of mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Details of batâgrower conflict in Papua New Guinea are scant, but a report by Hicks (1967) stated that bats and birds together caused the loss of 8.7 % of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) pods from an orchard from 1962 to 1965."

Understanding how the current extinction crisis will prune the tree-of-life is therefore critical for ensuring a continued provisioning of the ecosystem services upon which we rely, but for which we might lack detailed ecological knowledge of underlying process or mechanism (Faith et al. 2010).

97,197,0.267,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Wetlands and riparian forests belong to the most complex ecosystems on the planet. Their water balance and watershed systems are highly complex in terms of the ongoing interactions between ground-, interflow and surface waters (Haase and Nuissl 2007). Wetlands are able to store an enormous amount of water in their sediments, soils and vegetation. They can buffer extreme air temperatures due to the flows of evapotranspiration they create. Their typically loamy, clay and silt-rich floodplain soils are fantastic buffers and transmitters of all kinds of organic and inorganic pollutants emitted; they represent a kind of âtranslocation areaâ for matter and are a sink and source of pollutants at the same time. Mature floodplain trees sequester and store considerable amounts of CO2, contributing to climate change mitigation. In terms of flora and fauna, wetlands and riparian forests provide multiple wet and perennial habitats and, consequently, are home to thousands of species (Fig. 7.1). Since the industrial revolution and in particular since WW II, cities represent the main âhabitatâ for humans, with about 55% of the world population and current estimates assume that some 75% of the global population will live in cities by 2030 (UN 2016). Cities are places of close contact between humans and nature, where society and biodiversity are privy to complex interactions and co-evolution in terms of typical urban niches adapted gene mutation and species creation (Alberti 2015). Many cities have been established along rivers due to the economically and defenserelated strategic location and the availability of water resources and fertile soils (KÃ¼hn and Klotz 2006). Thus, wetlands, riparian forests and cities already share a long history punctuated with synergistic interactions and risk creation (Schanze 2006). More specifically, river floods endanger humans and their properties and humans in turn destroy wetlands and floodplain forests by means of construction, surface sealing, groundwater regulation and tree cuttings. However, when society supports the proper functioning of wetlands, these habitats and their forests can produce significant ecosystem services for urban dwellers, including the aforementioned regulation functions as well as being recreational areas and places for all age groups to experience and"

36,115,0.267,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"4.5.1.3 Responses to Landscape Structure Fragmentation studies have increasingly shifted their focus from being largely patch-centered toward taking a broader landscape-scale approach, thus acknowledging the overriding importance of the matrix and the existence of gradients of habitat conditions and quality as crucial determinants of species responses (Kupfer et al. 2006; Driscoll et al. 2013; Cisneros et al. 2015). Such gradients are provided, for example, by mosaics of old-growth forest, successional habitat, and different forms of agriculture. This paradigm shift is to some degree reflected within the more recent bat literature, as a growing number of studies have adopted matrix-inclusive approaches to studying fragmentation, although overall the number of studies is still small. In the broader literature, empirical evidence suggests widespread negative effects of habitat loss on many taxa (i.e., reduced abundance or density), whereas the effects of fragmentation per se are generally much weaker and may vary strongly in magnitude and direction of response (Fahrig 2003). In agreement with this, forest cover is a better predictor of bat assemblage characteristics (species richness or composition) than are measures of landscape configuration in Neotropical landbridge island systems (Meyer and Kalko 2008a; Henry et al. 2010). On the other hand, consistent responses to landscape composition or configuration at the assemblage level were harder to identify in studies conducted in fragmented Neotropical"

With their legal rights (resources), they are also in the position to block the development of the process, at least until a higher level of awareness (cognitions) has been developed (Fig. 6.8). However, after our diagnosis of the intensity of perceptions of local challenges for water use due to the impacts of climate changes, although the role of strong resources in blocking the development of adaptation measures could be considered highly negative, that is just a matter of interpretation. If the answer is âstrongâ, we must recognize that the influence on the dependent variable that the score is very negative. This characteristic of the interaction process can also be highly supportive. Perhaps the story for Vilaine, as also formulated in words, is that all three main factors now have a negative influence on the progress of adaptation. However, when change occurs, most likely a change from cognitions (more awareness), to motivation, such change would have a positive influence on drought adaptation. Thus, the same strong resource position that is now capable of blocking progress would then become a productive position in the development of adaptation measures. As a consequence, relatively rapid change is not impossible and even possible. To represent this possibility, Fig. 6.9 describes the process induced by an improvement of local climate change awareness. Finally, the last DROP meeting with practitioners, planned in the presence of French national observers (ONEMA, The French National Agency for water and aquatic environments) and held in June 2015, permitted an overview of the situation"

The latter may drive an increase in evapotranspiration and, potentially, increased microbial activity which could cause more rapid decomposition of soil organic matter (Magnani et al. 2007). Increased microbial activity would lead to mineralisation and related fertilising effects which would be especially important at previously nutrient-deï¬cient forest sites. Nitrogen emissions from human activities are already having potential fertilising effects so it is difï¬cult to isolate improved nitrogen availability due to higher temperatures. Nevertheless, the end result is expected to be increased tree growth in forests, with"
182,37,0.267,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"from interwar Britain and its empire, to the post-war international stage, it explores how developments in nutritional science and veterinary medicine, combined with economic depression, food shortages and the effects of war, drew attention to the undernourished, unhealthy bodies of both humans and cows, and suggested connections between them. By the early 1950s, under the United Nations and its agencies, cows had become key participants in the campaign against human hunger in the developing world. Their unproductive bodies inspired the formation of new health structures that brought together experts in human health, nutrition, veterinary medicine and agricultural science to create new types of cow that would prove more capable of supporting human health and nutrition. Chapter 5 continues to cross borders between nations and disciplines in its study of the tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus, and the ideas and investigations it inspired. It is particularly concerned with the work of parasitologist Calvin Schwabe, who is better known as a progenitor of the recent movement for OH. for Schwabe, Echinococcus was an animal in its own right, an active, opportunistic participant in both human and non-human ecological and cultural interactions. In following Schwabe as he followed Echinococcus, from the laboratory into human communities and multispecies ecosystems, and from Beirut to Kenya to California, this chapter reveals that the roots of his commitment to unifying human and veterinary medicine lay in his deep-seated engagement with the parasite. His investigations into its body and behaviour led him to view distinctions between human and non-human species as culturally contingent rather than fundamentally biological. This fed his conviction that human and veterinary medicine could only function truly effectively when practised in tandem. Chapter 6 takes forward the story of OH by exploring its emergence as a self-conscious movement, dedicated to the integrated study of problems at the interface between human health, animal health and the environment. It explores how Schwabeâs work influenced, and was reconfigured by, this movement, and locates its early development in several research and policy networks, which produced not one but several different forms of OH. The chapter also examines how humanâ animal health relationships have inspired and shaped OH, and how they are representedâin sometimes contradictory waysâin the texts and images produced by its researchers and advocates. It argues that in privileging the roles of animals as transmitters of diseases to humans, and"

They do so using nationally representative samples of households from which inferences concerning national trends can be drawn, and the patterns of poverty and well-being are developed. Use of the Bangladesh HIES by Szabo et al. (2016) showed how food security at the household level is negatively associated with creeping salinity in the study area. Yet these data sources are limited in information about the direct benefits people derive from their ecosystems, about their mobility and other responses, and on the health and well-being of populations. Hence the survey here provides a unique set of insights on human-environment relations in this delta. As highlighted in Chap. 21, ecosystem services are highly variable in space and time. This bespoke survey therefore builds in temporal variability by repeat interviews in three waves over a full calendar year: the analysis constructs detailed livelihood calendars. A further challenge for human-environment models is the multi-dimensional and contested nature of poverty, both as manifest in lack of material assets, an absence of health and also as a lived experience (Baulch 1996). Hence the survey is comprehensive in collecting specific variables that facilitate interdisciplinary analyses and consideration of material and subjective measurements of well-being alongside use of ecosystem services and livelihood diversity. It allows multilevel analysis and intra-household analyses: variables relate to individual men and women and to whole households. This chapter first briefly outlines the survey methodology and implementation (Sect. 23.2). Section 23.3 summarises the data available from the household survey; it highlights unique variables and aspects of the survey and those that are comparable with other standard datasets. Section 23.4 describes each of the publicly available datasets associated with the household survey, illustrated with selected descriptive statistics. The publicly available datasets are land cover data by Union for the field area in Khulna and Barisal Divisions, household listing data of 9,300 households, a household roster dataset that presents separately the basic data of the 8,000 people living in the households surveyed and three rounds of household survey data for approximately 1,500 separate households taking into account attrition between the three rounds. The chapter closes with a reflection on the reuse potential of the dataset. All data are available to download from the ReShare UK-based online data repository.1 The data are accompanied by English and Bengali versions of the questionnaire, as well as a glossary of terms used in the questionnaire.

Secondly, previous experiments on North American rivers, e.g., the Columbia River basin, the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin river basin and delta in California (Johnson 1999), have proven very costly in terms of time and money invested as well as the institutional complexities that had to be harmonized (Richter et al. 2006). In these cases the process entailed multiple layers (executive, manager, and technical) of decision and review (Walters et al. 2000) and was agitated by the levels of sociopolitical controversy surrounding the signiï¬cant economic trade-offs at hand (Richter et al. 2006). If success requires years of sustaining such effort, many might opt for less costly approaches. Finally, despite some exceptions (Allan and Stankey 2009), there are few, convincing success stories in AMâs history of risky and costly experiments (Lee 1999; Medema et al. 2008). One reason may be that often success is hard to detect when clear thresholds are difï¬cult to establish and measure (van Wilgen and Biggs 2011), though adaptive learning successfully developed ï¬ow thresholds on the Letaba (Pollard et al. 2009) and Kissimmee (Toth et al. 1998) rivers. Another reason is that no history of successfully repeated experiments can be built on the basis of contradictory deï¬nitions or applications of AM (Allen et al. 2011). The slow adoption of AM can broadly be explained by path dependence on conventional, control-centered management strategies. A variety of factors can contribute to this: funding and administrative priorities based on reactive rather than proactive management paradigms (Walters 1997), failure to identify or address the potential to shift goals to acknowledge the increased risk of surprise because of social sources of uncertainty (Tyre and Michaels 2011), defaulting to extant institutional norms rather than reï¬ecting, box-ticking as opposed to learning and favoring competition over cooperation (Allan and Curtis 2005), and resource limitations in terms of funding and human capital. The novel capacities that AM requires of any river manager would be a major barrier to adoption. These capacities include developing new ways for managers and stakeholders to collaborate under high uncertainty, especially in integrating science and policy in participatory processes, considering a wide range of practices over long time periods projected in future scenarios (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007). As opposed to direct administration of agency employees, managers might have to patiently attend to repeated phases of social learning by the community in implementing and then sustaining new and innovative management approaches (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007)."
152,213,0.267,interdisciplinary Perspectives On Mortality and Its Timings : When Is Death?,"againâ is roughly the standard for what has been called âhigher brain death,â the death of the brain where memory, reasoning, and consciousness reside. So higher brain death might mean ânever to be conscious againâ or ânever to have what is taken to be the essence of a human beingâ, or ânever to recover what had given someone their identityâ. In these cases, there is no question that the person is dead by any historically defensible category, but rather that she is in such a state that she is already socially and culturally dead and that therefore the living are justified in stopping measures which keep her biologically alive, that is, enteral nutrition and perhaps some assistance in breathing. Of course, we often stop these treatments, assuming for a moment that we consider providing food and air treatments, along with othersâantibiotics, vaso suppressors, specific therapiesâwhen death in its old-fashioned sense is taken to be imminent and all interventions hopeless. âPulling the plugâ, that is, removing the most critical interventionâthe ventilatorâis the main way of allowing death to enter. But this is another matter. The machinery of the intensive care unit has made biological death comport more closely with various conceptions of death as understood culturally even if âreally deadâ means what it has always meant. If the decision is taken that someone is ânever to have the essence of being human againâ, then the removal of technological life support can translate that decision into biological reality. But technology has done little to alter the rhythms of becoming dead in a broader cultural sense except, perhaps, to expand the lives of the dead among the living. They speak, as they always have, before and after, at the end of Shakespeareâs plays and in many other instances, sometimes as ghosts, but often not. âHe being dead yet speaketh,â St. Paul said of Abel, slain by his brother Cain. By his faith he speaks from the grave. We are about to read âthe work of a dead man,â announces the nineteenth-century Brazilian narrator in the prologue of The Posthumous Memoirs of BrÃ¡s Cubas by his compatriot, the novelist Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. Just to clarify, he wants to make readers aware of the âradical difference between [his] book and the Pentateuch:â Moses waited until the end to speak of the circumstances of his death; our author gives it away at the start. And lest we still miss the point: âI am not exactly a writer who is dead but a dead man who is a writer, for whom the grave was a second cradleâ. âI expiredâ he continues, âat two oâclock on Friday afternoon in the month of August, 1869, at my beautiful suburban place in"

Furthermore, it is plausible that in actual marine systems, background chemical concentrations in biota may already exceed the concentrations that microplastic ingestion would be able to explain, in which case no gradient for transfer would exist. In a follow up study, Koelmans et al. (2014b) used the same biodynamic model as was used for POPs to assess the potential of leaching of nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the intestinal tracts of lugworm (A. marina) and cod (Gadus morhua). Parameters for the lugworm were based on Besseling et al. (2013). Parameters for cod were based on actual abundances of microplastic particles in the cod GIT as observed by Foekema et al. (2013). The resulting model was validated against the data provided by Browne et al. (2013) for leaching of NP from PVC to A. marina. Then, the model was used to calculate the body burdens that could be explained from plastic ingestion, which were compared to NP and BPA body burdens actually measured in the field. Uncertainty in the most crucial parameters was accounted for by probabilistic modelling. The conservative analysis showed that plastic ingestion by the lugworm indeed results in chemical transfer to the organism, but yields NP and BPA concentrations that stay below the lower ends of global NP and BPA concentration ranges in the lugworm, and therefore is unlikely to constitute a relevant exposure pathway. A similar comparison showed that plastic ingestion is also likely to constitute a negligible exposure pathway for cod. Note that the key model concepts of chemical transfer in the intestinal tract or segments of the intestinal tract as condensed in Eqs. 11.7â11.9 are also applicable to higher marine organisms. They would only need different parameterizations and different initial boundary conditions."

123,65,0.266,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"âOne fine summer day, a local fisher came to the nursing home door with buckets full of fresh fish that he had just caught from his boat. He wanted to give it to us free of charge. We rejoiced, and thought that now we could create a fish barbecue for the residents. They would be so happy to get fresh food straight from the sea on their plates. The air at the nursing home would be filled with the pleasant smell of grilled fish. Then one of us remembered what the law says about food at the nursing home. Everything we serve as food to the residents has to come from a registered supplier, and the fisher was not on the list. This meant that it would be illegal to grill and serve the fresh fish from the sea at the home. Still we felt that it would be the right thing to do, as it would be such a rich and thrilling experience for the residentsâ (Norlin & Borvik, 2016). This event took place at SÃ¸bakken, a nursing home in the coastal town of Helgeroa in Norway.

231,1033,0.266,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The importance of addressing critical temporal scales in climate impact research has been documented for various lakes in the North Sea region (see Adrian et al. 2012; Sect. 10.2). A closer look at sub-hourly measurements showed that the rate of increase in the daily minima (night-time water temperature) exceeded that of the daily maxima (daytime water temperature) (Wilhelm et al. 2006). The consequences of this day-night asymmetry for the biota are unclear, but may contribute to some of the unexplained changes observed in ecosystem dynamics over time. Day-to-day variation in respiration seems to be common in lakes worldwide, including those in the North Sea region (Solomon et al. 2013). Daily variation in gross primary production explained 5â85 % of the daily variation in respiration. Solomon et al. (2013) found respiration to be closely coupled to gross primary production at a diurnal-scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, but more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Known changes in the thermal regime of lakes in the North Sea region (Sect. 10.2) operate over a broad range of temporal scales, and are closely related to lake morphometry: on sub-daily (Wilhelm and Adrian 2008) to weekly scales in polymictic lakes (Wagner and Adrian 2009b), and on weekly to monthly scales in monomictic or dimictic lakes (Gerten and Adrian 2000; Livingstone 2003). While variation in the timing of spring overturn affects underwater light conditions and thus the start of algal growth (Weyhenmeyer et al. 1999; Gerten and Adrian 2000; Peeters et al. 2007), variation in the timing of summer stratiï¬cation affects water temperature and internal nutrient loading and subsequent plankton development and species composition in productive lakes (Wilhelm and Adrian 2008; Wagner and Adrian 2011). Differences in water temperature between mixed and stratiï¬ed periods can be up to 5 Â°C within days or a just few weeks in summer, favouring thermophilic copepod species for example (Wagner and Adrian 2011). Changes in phenology in abiotic and biotic variables (see Sect. 10.4.2) operate on time scales of weeks (Weyhenmeyer et al. 1999; Gerten and Adrian 2000; Straile et al. 2003). Thus, in terms of their duration, seasons should be deï¬ned by cardinal events within the lake itself, rather than by ï¬xed calendar dates. Important markers successfully used to deï¬ne phenology-adjusted seasons in lakes include temperature thresholds, ice-off dates, the timing of the clear-water phase, and periods of stable thermal stratiï¬cation (Rolinski et al. 2007; Wagner and Adrian 2009a; Huber et al. 2010). Wagner et al.

73,564,0.266,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Urban agriculture in Cuba is practised along agrarian/agroecological rather than industrial/mechanised lines, with minimal artiï¬cial pesticides, fertilisers, or petroldependent technology (Diaz and Harris 2005; Manzano 2007), and with produce retailed directly to local food consumers (Premat 2012). The Cuban program was implemented in response to an acute food security crisis during the Special Period following the withdrawal of Soviet oil supplies in the early 1990s (Clouse 2014; Wright 2009). A signiï¬cant proportion of Cuban food production was shifted to urban land to bring sites of production closer to sites of consumption, as fossil fuel transport was limited by oil shortages (Wright 2009). Further, the shift to agroecological farming methods was driven by shortages of oil-based pesticides and fertilisers, and shortages of oil to drive farm machinery (Deere et al. 1994). Urban agriculture was not a deliberate governmental strategy to improve public and environmental health. There were, however, side-effects of the Cuban agricultural reforms which are anomalous in the developed world and which therefore merit the attention of Australian law and policy makers. Cuba is the only nation in the world to meet the World Wildlife Foundationâs deï¬nition of sustainable development, having both an acceptable ecological footprint per capita and an acceptable Human Development Index rating (World Wildlife Foundation 2006). Cubaâs low ecological footprint per person, low infant mortality and high life expectancy in the wake of the Special Period are an anomalous combination in the developed world. Immediately following the changes to Cubaâs food system in the early 1990s, there was a ârapid decline in death rates from diabetes and heart diseaseâ (Franco et al. 2013). Cuba is not here held up as a paragon or perfect model, and the Cuban system has past and ongoing problems (Hagelberg 2010; Alvarez 2001). The signiï¬cance of the Cuban data for Australian law and policy on urban food systems is that,"

On the other hand, ongoing conflict and violence, poverty, impunity of the perpetrators, and a lack of assistance prolong and aggravate their suffering and keep them frozen in the moment of their trauma.18 The life conditions of the Halabja survivors in the years following the attack were more than adverse to any kind of recovery. First of all, many survivors died in subsequent years from their injuries.19 Numerous others suffered from the long-term impact of the poison gas, from skin and eye diseases, damage to the respiratory and neural systems, and various forms of cancer, infertility, miscarriages and congenital disorders. Even in the third generation, the rate of leukemia is high among children (Gosden et al. 2001). The soil in and around Halabja will remain contaminated for a long time to come (AlaâAldeen 2005). Immediately after the attack, the Baath regime had razed the town of Halabja to the ground; there was no possibility of return. Many survivors stayed in Iran; others continued to hide in the mountains. The majority of survivors were forcibly resettled by the Baath regime in a so called mujamma (collective town) cynically named âNew Halabjaâ at a distance of some 70 km from the destroyed town. Like other urban settlements built for Anfal survivors, âNew Halabjaâ was a camp-like structure with housing, schools, and medical facilities. Its population lived under military control and was forbidden to leave and, especially, to set foot in Halabja.20 In 1991 a U.S.-led military coalition attacked Iraq in reaction to the latterâs invasion of Kuwait. The Kurds in Iraqâseeing ï¬nally a chance to defeat the dictatorâfollowed the U.S. call to arms, but were let down and abandoned by the coalition after its armistice with Iraq. The Kurdish insurrection was subsequently brutally crushed by Iraqi forces. At the moment of defeat, two million Kurds fled in utmost panic to Iran and Turkey, leaving behind all their belongings. The images of their mass exodus went around the world in the Spring of 1991. The panic among the fleeing Kurds could only be explained by their fear of further poison gas attacks that had been deeply imprinted into the minds of the Kurdish people in 1988."

Drawing on these foundations, this chapter explores the use of such data in decision-making processes. It reflects on what data might be used for, how it is packaged, what the challenges are and what to consider in getting it right. It is intended to be a thought-provoking look at insights gained in communicating biodiversity science for policy purposes over the last several years. With a particular focus on indicators, one of the most common forms in which observations are used by decision-makers, the chapter considers the context in which indicators are used and how they are developed. It explores the realities of indicator development and use, including some of the key challenges and ways around them. It also touches on assessments and assessment processes as another important tool linking science to policy. Keywords Indicator development"
278,297,0.265,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Two words in this question require further explanation: âimpactsâ and âembodiedâ. The term âimpactâ is used here in a very wide sense, comprising both pressure and impact indicators as defined by the causal DPSIR framework (Driving ForcesPressures-State-Impacts-Responses) that describes interactions between society and the environment.2 Environmental pressures include the use of resources, such as land, water or materials as well as the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) or pollutants. In the stricter definition provided by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards (ISO 2006; Hellweg et al. 2014), environmental impacts represent the (actual or potential) damage exerted by pressures, e.g. global warming, toxicity or biodiversity loss. Especially in the context of international trade, the expression environmental âburdenâ or âloadâ has been used as well as âburden shiftingâ (e.g. Giljum and Eisenmenger 2008; SchÃ¼tz et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2013) or âdisplacement of pressuresâ (e.g. Steen-Olsen et al. 2012) to describe the change of location where environmental pressures or impacts occur when resources from other countries are used indirectly through trade. For social and economic indicators, the distinction between pressures and impacts is less well defined. For the sake of simplicity, the term âimpactâ has been used for all indicators in this chapter (see also Table 8.1). The word âembodiedâ describes indirect impacts that can be âattributed toâ, are âassociated withâ or are âembedded inâ activities that are not directly linked to the impacts. In the context of trade, consuming a product in one country can lead to impacts in many other countries, depending on where the production and supply chain processes occur that are required to produce the final consumer product.

309,414,0.265,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"necessity in order to live, but that implies, most of the time, the death of animals that are considered as edible. Some cultures clear up this paradox by putting an interdiction on food that requires the death of an animal by advocating vegetarianism. In most of the cases, dietary murder is surrounded by a series of rituals of protection or social devices the function of which is to legitimise the animalâs death. Then anxiety comes from the conflict between the need to eat meat and the fact of having to impose suffering on animals and take their life in order to do so. To eat, then, is an act that imposes choices, decisions, but also the need to take objective and symbolical risks. Those different paradoxes generate the three forms of specific anxiety that dietary cultures try to manage. Regulation of the ambivalence of pleasure-displeasure is maintained by culinary culture, what Levi Strauss named the âculinary systemâ, that is to say the set of social rules that define forms of preparation, cooking, seasoning, and so on. New food is introduced in a culture by being prepared according to ways of cooking, preparation, or by being associated with strongly identified seasoning, which reassures the eater by giving this product a familiar taste. More generally, a mode of preparation or seasoning already known has a reassuring effect by inserting the new food in the normative dietary system. The management of the second ambivalence health-illness is one of the most interesting questions in the anthropology of food. The capacity of humans to build knowledge simply in order not to poison themselves and maintain their survival is a real cognitive enigma. All cultures have at their disposal a âtraditionalâ dietetic functioning as a science of categories that structures the order of the edible. It can be organised around a binary system like: yin and yang of a macrobiotic diet, the five elements of the Chinese and Vietnamese âorderâ of nature (Poulain 1997a-I), or categories of âwarmâ, âcoldâ, âhumidâ or âdryâ, used in different cultural universes such as Hippocratic European medicine (Flandrin and Montanari 2013), fishermen of the Malay peninsula (Wilson 1967), natives from Central America (Messer 1984), or some Indian ethnic groups (Mahias 1985). The membership of one of these categories gives to food particular qualities that justify their consumption in some contexts or recommend them to some individuals. Those profane dietetics allow eaters to conceptualise the link between diet and health. This knowledge is often presented as"

169,781,0.265,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"sturgeon populations is the overall goal, in the short- and midterm, accompanying ex situ actions (No. 4) are necessary. The main idea of ex situ is to establish captive, life cycle units, which should serve as living gene banks. By rearing juvenile ï¬sh in a hatchery outside of the river (âoff-siteâ) and releasing them into the wild at a later stage, it is possible to stabilize and strengthen populations. However, ex situ measures are not a stand-alone activity, as they cannot be sustainable without in situ measures and therefore can only act as short- to midterm solutions until in situ habitats and populations are reestablished (Reinartz 2015). Conservation hatcheries always have to be linked with the natural population so as to maintain a natural gene pool and guarantee a broad genetic diversity, which is essential for long-term survival of species. Furthermore, seminatural conditions should be provided by the rearing facility to enable the sturgeons to adapt in the wild and to show homing behavior based on water chemistry, nutrition, ï¬ow velocities, temperatures, exposure to predators, etc. (Reinartz 2015; Friedrich et al. 2016). A feasibility study for ex situ measures for Danube sturgeons (Reinartz 2015) and two hatchery manuals of the FAO (Chebanov et al. 2011; Chebanov and Galich 2011) provided the basis for two pilot projects to address the need for ex situ actions in two Danube sections. The LIFE project âLIFE- Sterlet: Restoration of sterlet populations in the Austrian Danubeâ targets ex situ actions for sterlet in the Upper Danube and applies a technique wherein eggs and juveniles will be reared under seminatural conditions in Danube water with natural diets. The juveniles will be released into suitable areas in several size classes and are partly tagged with external tags and hydroacoustic transmitters to supplement in situ research (Friedrich et al. 2016). In the Lower Danube, the project STURGENE evaluated different facilities for their suitability for two tasks: to keep wild brood stock and/or to raise juveniles for ex situ actions (Reinartz et al. 2016). This survey showed that there are few facilities available for either of the two tasks, and although some hatcheries can be adapted to fulï¬ll at least the role to keep and spawn brood stock, it will be necessary to build new facilities to accomplish for both tasks. To minimize the risk to loose entire conservation units and genetic strains due to catastrophic events, it is necessary to spread them over different facilities (Friedrich et al. 2015). Both LIFE Sterlet and STURGENE are considered pilot projects, and the overall aim within âSturgeon 2020â is to extend the measures taken within both projects to all species and areas within the Danube River Basin (Table 26.2). The next step is the development of an ex situ hatchery in the Lower Danube for the native species and the securing of funding for the construction and long-term operation of the facility."

Similar progress has taken place in Bangladesh: advances in communications technology provide regulators with detailed knowledge of river flow, level and quality in real time, with sophisticated modelling ability aiding the regulation of water use management. Legal frameworks allow water use to be varied in response to changes in resource availability, social and environmental priorities, and the better balancing of periods of flood and inter-annual scarcity. In line with the stronger economic situation in Bangladesh, water and sewage service provision have been extended, and the careful planning of urban expansion has greatly restricted water pollution and reduced the incidence of water-borne disease. This has increased riverine fish stocks and rural engagement, with cultured and floodplain fish production also growing. Subsistence and artisanal fisheries have decreased but commercial fisheries have conversely increased, though the impact of this has been reduced through improved national and international governance of fisheries, which is now focused on sustainable coastal fishing. The successful achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and subsequent iterations, has created a society where the vast majority of the population have access to piped water in their homes and improved sanitation facilities. This has been aided through excavation of ponds and tanks for conservation of water and the use of local technology for water treatment, such as pond sand filtering. This improvement in drinking water availability, combined with the use of deeper aquifers in many places, has helped people avoid the problems associated with consumption of saline- and arsenic-contaminated water. Steps have been taken to ensure sustainable use and management of groundwater. There has been a major focus on conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater. Better monitoring of water table levels and groundwater / surface water interactions, and the ability to amend water use rights, is progressively improving the situation, although alternative supplies may still be difficult to apply. Adequate upland flow has been ensured in water channels through the construction of the Ganges Barrage, which has helped preserve the coastal estuary ecosystem threatened by seawater intrusion.

In the future, the climate change-driven mangrove forest cover loss could substantially hamper natural production of honey and wax, accentuating the man-animal conflict during honey collection. It may therefore be advisable to promote apiculture in the vicinity of settlements as well as in the core forest areas as a sustainable livelihood option for the local population. This would ensure not only a secure income but the incidences of injury or even casualty during honey collection could be avoided. A substantial amount of carbon is stored in the forest of Bangladesh Sundarbans at present. This sequestration can play a crucial role in combating the anthropogenic increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. The natural performance of this mangrove ecosystem which in turn is beneficial to the global climate might be developed as a wealth-creating instrument under a well-functioning, well-informed market mechanism. However, unless a market mechanism, conferring rights to the forest-dependent community to trade carbon credit to the global community, is developed, sustainable development in the delta will remain elusive."

255,109,0.265,Railway Ecology,"trapping and indirect evidence, such as scat identiï¬cation, was used in Australia for the ï¬rst time by Hunt et al. (1987). This technique has been repeatedly improved, as it was the ï¬rst widely used method to conï¬rm culvert/wildlife pass usage. Due to its low costs, it is more cost-effective for short-term surveys than modern alternatives, like video-surveillance (Ford et al. 2009; Mateus et al. 2011). However, the use of track pads is limited to optimal conditions, as the material employed can become useless by rain or livestock passage (RodrÃ­guez et al. 1996, 1997; Mateus et al. 2011), and there can be track misidentiï¬cation and underestimation of crossings due to track overlapping (Ford et al. 2009). Tracks in snowy landscapes can help to estimate the qualitative crossing of certain sections (Olsson et al. 2010), although limitations of this method regarding misidentiï¬cation and track overlapping are similar to those from sandy beds. (3) Video-surveillance. Modern technology allows the monitoring of pass usage thanks to cameras activated by infrared motion detectors at the pass entrance (Ford et al. 2009; Mateus et al. 2011). This method is constrained by the sensitiveness of the camera monitor sensor (Ford et al. 2009), which is especially limiting in large passes and with small animals (Mateus et al. 2011), because video cameras cover small areas and only animals close to the sensor are recorded (Ford et al. 2009; GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2010; Mateus et al. 2011). Thus, a logical next step to evaluate the use of wildlife passes has been the development of wireless sensor networks (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2010). These are low-cost devices that, by using a camera at the entrance of the pass and an infrared motion sensor network deployed in the surrounding area, enable the recording of reactions of animals approaching the wildlife pass and their eventual crossings (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2010). (4) Capture-mark-recapture (hereinafter âCMRâ). These are ï¬ne-scale methods as they are individual-based, but they are intrusive, time- and budget-consuming, and require safety measures both for the animals and the researchers working around the transport infrastructures; all this leads to small- to modest-sized samples (Simmons et al. 2010). Tagging must be adapted to the size and the ecology of the target species. CMR with numbered plastic tags allowed Bhattacharya et al. (2003) to monitor bumblebee movement across a railway, with a recapture rate of 31% (n = 367). In France, Vandevelde et al. (2012) (see Chap. 16) used a thin-point permanent pen to mark gatekeeper butterflies with a recapture rate of 30% (n = 149). Alternatively, passive integrated transponders have been proven to be useful to monitor wildlife passages. Once the animal crosses, an antenna connected to a decoder unit installed in the pass records the individual, time, and date of crossing (recapture rate = 50%, n = 6; Soanes et al. 2013). Radio-tracking-based projects share some of the advantages (ï¬ne-scale, individual-based) and disadvantages (intrusive, time- and budget-consuming) of the previous methods, although the increasing effectiveness (e.g., satellite-based telemetry) and decreasing price currently make radio-tracking suitable for a wide variety of organisms (Simmons et al. 2010). Furthermore, the devices are becoming miniaturized to the point of being a feasible alternative for some invertebrates (e.g.,"

The length of each stage is species-specific and, as a result, different species are used in different management schemes. For all production forests, the stagnation phase and natural decay are eliminated by prior harvest. Two major tree types can be distinguished based on their life strategy: the pioneer species and the late-successional and climax forest species (see Box 6.8). Typical pioneer species, e.g. birch and pine, all share a similar strategy. They produce large quantities of wind-dispersed seeds, prefer mineral soils for regeneration and require full sunlight to establish and grow. Plantation forestry uses species from this group, as they show tremendous growth in their youth but soon reach a culmination in increment, allowing for short rotations. Their natural lifespan is comparatively low (Table 6.13). The majority of late-successional and climax forest species are adapted to regeneration inside the forest, in shady conditions or small light gaps. The seeds are usually larger (e.g. beech) than those of pioneers, and the seedlings can often not tolerate full sunlight exposure or temperature"

ERL/ERM guidelines are most useful when supporting data such as in situ biological analyses, toxicological assays, and other variables have been measured that confirm suspected cause-and-effect relationships. Despite the limitations above, by convention, the National Coastal Condition Reports (NCCRs) assess coastal sediment quality based on the number of ERL/ERM exceedances (USEPA 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012). In this summary, ERL/ERM values are used only to draw attention to sites where contaminant concentrations exceed levels that may be of biological significance; however, cause-and-effect or toxicity is not inferred. The results of the NCCRs are summarized including exceedances of ERL and ERM values to qualitatively describe the distribution of higher and lower levels of contaminants in sediments and to assist in discerning the sources of the contamination but not for predicting sediment quality or toxicity. In those cases where NCCR conclusions about sediment quality/toxicity are inferred, additional variables have been taken into account, and attribution of degraded benthic conditions solely to elevated chemical concentrations is often not possible. Furthermore, ERL values used to classify sediment metal concentrations (Cr, Cu, Ni, and As) are close to or less than natural background crustal values for Mississippi River suspended matter and Gulf of Mexico sediments (Table 4.1). In some cases, according to a peer reviewer of this chapter, Long et al. (1995) used concentrations of Cr and Ni that were determined with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) techniques that used an acid leach (without hydrofluoric acid) rather than total dissolution of the sediment to calculate ERL/ERM values. ERL/ERM values also have been revised over the years as additional data have become available, so reports may use differing values to assess exceedances. These limitations should be taken into account when considering the summaries in this chapter. Mapping and categorizing the number of sites that exceed ERL/ERM values are used to assess the location and origins of contaminants but not to infer or predict in situ biological effects or sediment toxicity."
35,319,0.265,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"The U.S. has had a National Aquaculture Plan since 1980, however growth has been primarily in land based, fresh water species, until the last decade (Anderson and Shamshak 2008). The 2012 US Aquaculture Census put the industry at 269,550 tonnes, valued at $1.233 B. Mariculture species represent 37% of that value, and consist of primarily near shore, ocean culture of salmon and various mollusks, grown entirely in state waters (NMFS 2013). US seafood imports has steadily risen to 91% of annual consumption, causing numerous government and public calls for expanding domestic supplies from aquaculture and particularly from marine aquaculture and farming the EEZ (e.g., PEW Ocean Comm. 2003; U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy 2004; U.S. Ocean Action Plan 2004; NOAA 10-year Plan for Marine Aquaculture 2007; PEW Marine Aquaculture Task Force 2007; NOAA Aquaculture Policy 2011; Department of Commerce Aquaculture Policy 2011). Clearly, there is a well-documented national policy to encourage commercial aquaculture in the EEZ to increase domestic supplies and help address the growing seafood security issue. Central to this policy is establishing the regulatory and legal framework to permit and manage aquaculture sustainably in federal waters (e.g., a permit and site administration process that provides for management, environmental monitoring, and enforcement and site tenure, exclusive use, and property rights and protections for the commercial projects) (Fletcher 2004). From publication of the ï¬rst National Aquaculture Plan to the present, regulatory constraints have been frequently cited as a major obstacle to U.S. industry expansion (Firestone et al. 2005; Stickney et al. 2006; GAO 2008; NOAA 2008). The regulatory framework for aquaculture in the EEZ is the least developed ocean jurisdiction and can best be described as nascent or a work in progress. There are two emerging approaches extant:"
219,666,0.265,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Drivers of Land Degradation in Ethiopia Poor land-use practices and population pressure are the major drivers of land degradation in Ethiopia (Genanew and Alemu 2012; Berry 2003). High population pressure, especially in the highland, has led to a decline in arable area, which in turn led to agricultural encroachment onto marginal areas. Several other factors contribute to the unsustainable land management in Ethiopia. The patterns of land ownership and government control, low levels of investment in agriculture and animal husbandry, poor rural infrastructure and markets and low levels of technology are cited as the underlying causes of land degradation by Berry (2003). Policy failures and lack of capacity to implement government interventions also contribute to land and other resource degradation (The Global Mechanism 2007; Wagayehu 2003). The less-than-desired and largely unsustainable impact of series of conservation measures usually involving physical structures such as terraces, bunds and tree planting, among others, is explained by lack of policy action or framework that is essential to address (or minimize the effect of) the externalities of beneï¬ts or costs associated with participation or lack of participation in such programs (by farmers). This problem is attributed to the relative negligence of policy and institutional factors in the numerous conservation programs ï¬nanced through food/cash aid projects (Berry 2003; Eyasu 2003). This problem is compounded by little evidence-based and action-oriented research (Shiferaw and Holden 1999; von Braun et al. 2013). Another key driver of the problem is a lack of capacity and/or commitment to address the problem appropriately. Inconsistent, partial or insufï¬cient interventions reinforce the problem while eroding the capacity of farmers/the real victims/and local authorities to deal with the problem fundamentally. Most interventions focus on addressing the symptoms of the problem (i.e. reducing the human cost of the problem, distress sales of assets) at the expense of long-term and long-lasting solutions. In other words, by focusing on short-term solutions, such interventions encourage inaction or the postponement of real-actions (i.e. actions by beneï¬ciaries and authorities to address the root cause of the problem). A review to document various proximate and underlying drivers of land degradation in Eastern Africa, including Ethiopia, has been carried out by Kirui and"

241,1272,0.265,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"European cities including Stockholm (Michelozzi et al. 2009), the effect of heat on mortality in Stockholm and the Stockholm area (RocklÃ¶v et al. 2009; City of MalmÃ¶ 2011) and the link between the intensiï¬cation of thermal and humidity conditions with unfavourable bioclimatic effects including heat stroke on the urban population of Cracow (Piotrowicz 2009). Seasonal differences were examined for Cracow (Piotrowicz 2009) and Gothenburg (Thorsson et al. 2011). Results indicated more problems with excessive temperature in summer and different outcomes for other seasons. A future decrease in temperature stress and better outdoor thermal comfort in winter, spring and autumn was announced for Gothenburg (Thorsson et al. 2011). A study in Cracow found that more frequent mild winters could cause the human body to lose the ability to adapt in colder winters (Piotrowicz 2009). The costs of heat events can be signiï¬cant. For example, preventing the loss of 18,000 lives in the 2003 European heat wave could have rendered beneï¬ts of up to USD 72 billion (HalsnÃ¦s et al. 2007). The heat waves across Europe in 2003 and 2010 indicate the vulnerability of urban populations. This is despite the high levels of development in Europe (Lass et al. 2011). Identifying social vulnerability to heat waves is important. Urban populations are generally more vulnerable to heat waves than rural populations. Within the urban population, particularly vulnerable groups include elderly people and those suffering from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (Piotrowicz 2009). A study on the effects of temperature on the elderly in Sweden conï¬rmed the impact of heat on mortality (RocklÃ¶v and Forsberg 2010). The study also showed that the effects of high relative humidity and high temperature were greatest in the most densely populated area, Stockholm (RocklÃ¶v and Forsberg 2010). In circumpolar regions, the populations at greatest risk from the adverse health effects of cold are children, elderly people or people suffering from cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Factors such as ageing and urbanisation may contribute to the rise in cold-induced health problems (MÃ¤kinen 2007). Svensson et al. (2003), referring to Gothenburg, argued that climate at high latitudes presents a number of particular bioclimatic problems, both physiological and psychological, and cold stress is perhaps more important, since people in Scandinavia seldom complain that conditions are too hot. Changes in Air Quality A decrease in air quality is a health-related effect of climate change in cities. Cities often have higher concentrations of air pollutants than surrounding rural areas (Eliasson and Holmer 1990; Jacob and Winner 2009). During 2005â2007 in Sczcecin, thermal stress and overheating, together with high levels of air pollutants, accounted for a signiï¬cant and direct threat to human health, especially for people suffering"

Maintaining diversity within the species is clearly important for its survival. â¢ Invasive species â small stands of Fiji sago palm are susceptible to invasion by a variety of aggressive alien species. The vines Merremia peltata and Mikania micrantha are particularly aggressive, while the naturalized pond apple Annona glabra can be a serious threat. How to deal with these requires restoration work experience trialing different techniques. â¢ Ecosystem value â given the former abundance of the Fiji sago palm especially in coastal areas behind the mangrove and its tolerance of saline inundation, it may have potential in developing climate change adaptation measures. Currently we do not fully understand the role that the palm plays in its ecosystem at natural levels of abundance and ecosystem composition (predators, dispersal, pollinators, etc.). Given its former abundance, this role may be substantial. A detailed study of its synecology was identified as being important including the variation in the current natural populations."
175,25,0.264,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Water resource systems have beneï¬ted both people and their economies for many centuries. The services provided by such systems are multiple. Yet in many regions of the world they are not able to meet even basic drinking water and sanitation needs. Nor can many of these water resource systems support and maintain resilient biodiverse ecosystems. Typical causes include inappropriate, inadequate and/or degraded infrastructure, excessive withdrawals of river flows, pollution from industrial and agricultural activities, eutrophication resulting from nutrient loadings, salinization from irrigation return flows, infestations of exotic plant and animals, excessive ï¬sh harvesting, flood plain and habitat alteration from development activities, and changes in water and sediment flow regimes. The inability of water resource systems to meet the diverse needs for water often reflect failures in planning, management, and decision-makingâ and at levels broader than water. Planning, developing, and managing water resources to ensure adequate, inexpensive, and sustainable supplies and qualities of water for both humans and natural ecosystems can only succeed if we recognize and address the causal socioeconomic factors, such as inadequate education, corruption, population pressures, and poverty. Over the centuries, surface and ground waters have been a source of water supply for agricultural, municipal, and industrial consumers. Rivers have provided hydroelectric energy and inexpensive"

376,372,0.264,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Rangeland ecology and management have undergone a major transformation in the past quarter century as nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory were adopted to increase consistency with observed ecological dynamics and management outcomes. Equilibrium ecology had long been a guiding ecological principle that emphasized linear and predictable ecosystem dynamics and it supported the steadystate management model that prevailed throughout the twentieth century. Equilibrium ecology was challenged on the basis of both theoretical inconsistencies and its inability to account for observed ecosystem dynamics. Nonequilibrium ecology recognizes that disturbance, spatial heterogeneity, and multiple stable states, in addition to internal biotic regulation, have a major influence on ecosystem dynamics (Wu and Loucks 1995). In addition to these broad implications of nonequilibrium ecology, rangeland ecology was explicitly challenged by the persistent nonequilibrium model that originated in pastoral systems in East Africa. This model indicated that forage availability and livestock numbers were seldom in equilibrium because vegetation recovered more rapidly than livestock numbers following multiyear drought (Ellis and Swift 1988). It was further assumed that this weak coupling between vegetation and livestock minimized the potential for grazing to degrade rangeland resources. However, the persistent nonequilibrium model has been qualified by recognizing that livestock are always in equilibrium with the key resource areas of a grazed system, even though they may only be loosely coupled to abundant wet-season resources. Reinterpretation of the nonequilibrium persistent model challenges the legitimacy of the ânewâ rangeland ecology by reaffirming that stocking rate and carrying capacity are valid concepts for grazing management, albeit in the context of larger landscapes and longer time periods. Two categories of resilience exist to describe unique patterns of ecosystem dynamics. Engineering resilience assumes that systems are confined to a single basin of attraction and it is represented by the time required for a system to return to its original"
337,327,0.264,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"DECUMA has been applied in Kajiado District, southwest Kenya, and applications are ongoing in Samburu, Kenya, as well as Mali and Tibet. The Malian application provides an example of the usefulness of making tools used in integration portable. In that work, led by N. Hanan of South Dakota State University, we are exploring changes in the hydrology of lakes, the roles that pastoral people have had in those changes, and the benefits to them. A hydrological model (SWAT; Gassman et al. 2007) is being linked to the ecosystem model called ACE (African Carbon Exchange), which in turn is being linked to DECUMA. By programmatically isolating the materials DECUMA requires from an ecosystem model (see Boone et al. 2011 for details), we can relatively easily link the model with any ecosystem simulation tool that can provide the needed information (e.g., forage availability and forage acquired by animals). Our ongoing analyses in Samburu, Kenya demonstrates this kind of integrated modeling. C. Lesorogol of Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri has gathered in-depth anthropological data for two study sites in southwest Samburu District, Mbaringon and Siambu. The sites differ in ecological settings, with Mbaringon at lower elevation and with less rainfall, for example. But the main difference of anthropological interest is that Siambu is subdivided, and Mbaringon remains communal lands (although somewhat fragmented). In the 1970s residents within some districts in Kenya began to subdivide into individually owned parcels. In Siambu, the land was divided into 240 small individually owned parcels. We are also investigating changes in Samburu norms, where the sense of reciprocity and sharing is less important in young peoplesâ lives. Our integrated assessments are driven by both theoretical questions and by questions put forth by stakeholders (Reid et al. 2009). The eight scenarios (numbered below) we are addressing in Samburu reflect this, and highlight the flexibility of using comprehensive simulation tools such as SAVANNA and DECUMA. Central to our work are questions of subdivision and its effects. We are simulating sedentarizing people and their animals on individually owned parcels, and the effects of that on livelihoods (1). Another scenario asks about the influence of commercial cropping in Siambu and fence building in Mbaringon, and the effects of loss of access has on livestock (2). These types of scenarios are represented in the modeling system by altering spatial surfaces or agent behaviors so as to prevent animals from leaving home parcels or from using areas that are inaccessible. We describe a diversity of scenarios to demonstrate the utility of integrated modeling but discuss one (number 8) in more detail here. Both Siambu and Mbaringon are grazing refuges for herders outside those areas. When drought conditions hold in other areas of Samburu, herders move their animals into these areas. In a scenario, we are adding additional livestock to each area, and summarizing effects on the resident animals (3). Plains zebras (Equus quagga) and occasionally Grevyâs zebras (Equus grevyi) are joined by various antelopes in the Mbaringon study site. We will vary the numbers of wildlife by a factor of four in scenarios, with and without tourism benefits to local people, to judge effects on livestock numbers and household livelihoods (4). Livestock sales are increased in simulations, above the observed number of sales that is typical (5). This is an"

Therefore, even if overall health conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean improve, dependency rates of the very elderly will still likely increase as life expectancy rises. Compounding the problem, as societies age, more people need care, but fewer caregivers are available, given the drop in fertility (WHO, 2015). In a world where more people are both elderly and dependent, two main challenges loom for future generations: providing health care and income support (pensions) for the elderly. Combined, these challenges could prove burdensome. Taking care of the elderly is substantially more expensive than taking care of the young. Evidence from both OECD member-states and Latin American and Caribbean countries shows that people spend a substantial portion of their medical expenses in the last decade of life, and that the percentage of people at this stage is increasing as the population ages. Health care spending in per capita terms is between four and ten times higher for an 80 year-old than for a 3 year-old (see Figure 6.3). The shift in population composition will substantially increase health care costs. Currently, the elderly consume 17 percent of total health expenditures in Latin America and the Caribbean (even though they make up less than 8 percent of the population): this share is projected to rise to over Figure 6.3 Public and Private Consumption of Health Care over a Lifetime"

For example, the importance of the Nietoperek fortifications in Western Poland as a bat hibernaculum was first brought to the attention of bat biologists outside the Iron Curtain by a Russian plan to dump radioactive waste there. The plan was shelved as a result of a successful campaign by conservationists. Throughout Poland, groups known as âbunkermenâ meet socially in underground fortifications where they may disturb the bats. Thomas (1995) showed that non-tactile disturbance from seemingly innocent cave visits during hibernation periods can cause bats to arouse and maintain significantly greater flight activity for up to eight hours afterwards. Such arousals are highly detrimental to their over-winter survival and non-tactile disturbance during other critical periods such as reproduction may lead to: (1) death of young that lose their roost-hold and fall to the cave floor, (2) females abandoning the roost for less ideal sites where prospects for reproductive success may be reduced, (3) greater energy expenditure among females and less efficient energy transfer to young (translating into slower growth of young and increased foraging demands on females), (4) reductions in the thermoregulatory benefits of a roost as a result of decreased numbers of bats frequenting the site (McCracken 1989; Sheffield et al. 1992). As a result, uncontrolled human disturbance often leads to decreases in numbers of bats roosting in caves and mines (Tuttle 2013). For instance, disturbance"

The comparison between LT276 (dashed line) and the base case (solid line) is also interesting because over large parts of the simulation period, the LT276 run performs better than the base run. This is counterintuitive since a longer boat lifetime result in fewer boat orders. The cause for LT276 to perform better lies in a better distribution of orders during the multi-year cycle. The difference only changes in around 2037 when many of the large boats need to be replaced and since the lifetime of large boats is more sensitive to any reduction or extension of the normal boat lifetime, the effects can be observed more sharply after 2037. Also, in that time there is a strong clustering of orders in the LT276 run prompting OCEAN to expand its capacity sharply. The fact that both policies fare better over most of the simulated period suggests there are local optima for setting the boat lifetime where OCEAN does not lose revenues but the operators have the possibility to maximize their revenues through longer use of their boats. This does not occur in the current base case where the normal boat lifetime is 20 years. For the operators, however, the effects are mostly opposite. Naturally, the operators would like to maximize their revenue and use the boat as long as possible. The effects of increasing and decreasing the boat lifetime results in a difference of about 1 million euro of cash flow in the case of SEAbility and a larger increase in spending for âMarket 1â, one operator in the market representing half of the transport capacity of all the other markets (Fig. 13). âMarket 1â is used for illustrative purposes, all other operators experience the same effects. The case of SEAbility is interesting because the cash flow for both policies performs better between 2035 and 2045 although the base run eventually catches up. For âMarket 1â, however, the spending on boats is higher for both policies, which should only be expected for the LT204 run. SEAbility proï¬ts disproportionately from more frequent replacement of their boats because of the small size of their fleet, which explains the better performance of LT204 and saves more money in the case of LT276. In the case of âMarket 1â, both policies are more expensive because in LT204 boats have to be purchased more frequently and in LT276 the boats are more evenly distributed allowing the operators to purchase more large boats. accumulated cash flow OCEAN"

This process stimulated and informed the development of SVP volunteer management systems largely reï¬ected in an evolving induction process and associated induction pack.3 Over the past ï¬ve years, the SVP has encountered most of the risks identiï¬ed above. At the more alarming and less âlikelyâ end of the spectrum, there have been outbreaks of terrorism and civil disobedience (typically quite isolated and around election periods or involving tribal disputes). Road trafï¬c accidents remain one of the greatest risks to volunteers in all low-resource settings (Gedde et al. 2011: 186). Bhatta et al. (2009) conï¬rm the importance of road trafï¬c accidents as a major cause of volunteer morbidity and mortality. In a survey of VSO volunteers, diarrhoea was the most prevalent heath risk reported (by 79.9%) with highest levels found amongst short stays and younger volunteers. This is followed by skin and dental problems and 17.5% reported some form of road trafï¬c injury. The authors are clear to point out that the response rate to their survey was small (36%) and that this response rate may be skewed in favour of those who had experienced problems (and had something interesting to report). The situation is exacerbated in the Ugandan context by the use of âboda bodasâ (motorcycle taxis) and a study of Peace Corps volunteers in Africa found that 60% of road accidents were related to motorcycle use (Bernard et al. 1989). These risks to individuals also present a risk to the NHS potentially affecting the subsequent safe return of work-ï¬t employees. Exposure to infectious disease presents more direct potential impacts on return and these are risks that the wider public may become aware of and sensitised to.4 Since the commencement of the SVP, Uganda has experienced at least three localised outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever. We have also witnessed several instances of needlestick injury. Both of these were responded to immediately triggering expert advice and a constant iteration of the induction pack.

Some contaminants were released into the environment years ago and persist, while others continue to be released. Contaminants, in particular the SVOCs and metals that are the focus of this summary, are found in industrial and municipal discharges and emissions, urban and agricultural runoff, accidental spills, and wet and dry atmospheric deposition. Of the 11 environmental concerns identified in United States (U.S.) estuaries, 8 potentially involve contaminants and collectively affect all of the 28 estuaries considered (Figure 4.1). Releases of contaminants to the environment can be intentional (e.g., permitted discharges) and/or accidental (e.g., spills). Contaminants enter marine environments through the air, dissolved in or absorbed on particles in water, or as solid or liquid discharges. Hydrophobic compounds released into air and water preferentially adsorb onto particulate matter, and often, some portion is eventually deposited in sediments. Contaminants discharged as solids and liquids can result in rapid incorporation into sediments. Concentrations and geographic distributions of sediment contaminants are heterogeneous due to spatial and temporal variations in inputs, sediment deposition and accumulation rates, variable susceptibility to contamination and rates of removal, variations in chemical form and physicochemical properties, and differences in water inflow rates and receiving water residence times. Considerations of contaminant SVOCs in sediments are restricted to those chemicals most commonly studied including hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (see Appendix A for details of the origins, toxicity, and environmental fate of SVOCs). Hydrocarbons are generally measured as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are the portion of petroleum that accounts for most of its toxicity. The contaminant metals considered are those of greatest environmental concern including lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), barium (Ba), vanadium (V), and copper (Cu) (see Appendix B for details of the origins, toxicity, and environmental fate of metals)."
