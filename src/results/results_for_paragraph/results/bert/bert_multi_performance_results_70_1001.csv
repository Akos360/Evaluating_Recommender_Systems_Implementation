We will give a brief description of what is happening. Later we will see the mathematical model that describes both spin and polarization. Recall our quantum clock. We can ask if the hand is pointing at twelve, or we can ask if the hand is pointing at six. The information we gain from either question tells us which of the numbers 12 or 6 the hand is pointing to, but the Yes/No answers are reversed. For the polarized squares the analogous questions are asked by rotating the square by ninety degreesânot one hundred and eighty. The information we obtain is the same. The difference is that if the answer is yes, the photon passes through the filter and we can perform more measurements on it, but if the answer is no, the filter absorbs the photon, so we cannot ask it further questions. The first two experiments involved just two sheets and are telling us exactly the same thing: When we repeat a measurement, we get the same result. In both experiments we are measuring the polarization in the vertical and horizontal directions two times. In these experiments, the photons that pass through the first filter have vertical orientations. The first experiment, where the second filter also has vertical orientation, we are asking the question, âIs the photon vertically polarized?â twice and we receive the answer âYesâ twice. In the second experiment, the second question is changed to âIs the photon horizontally polarized?â and receives the answer âNo.â Both experiments give us the same information, but the negative answer for the second question in the second experiment means that the photon is absorbed and so, unlike the first experiment, it is not available for further questioning. In the third experiment, the filter that has been rotated through fortyfive degrees is now measuring the polarization at angles of 45Â° and 135Â°. We"
26,31,0.477,Cognitive Supervision for Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Laser Surgery,"2.1 Physical Properties of Light Our understanding of the nature of light is based on the fact that it exhibits properties of both electromagnetic (EM) waves and elementary particles, this characteristic is known as the wave-particle duality [1]. First, we consider the description of light as EM waves; the terms light and EM radiation are used interchangeably throughout this dissertation. Light can be regarded as the perturbation produced by the interplay of mutually related electric and magnetic fields. Each pair of electric/magnetic fields is characterized by a common wavelength Î» and oscillate perpendicular with each other and at right angle to the direction of propagation, as shown in Fig. 2.1. In general, EM radiation is classified according to the range of wavelengths it contains. The EM spectrum covers all the possible wavelengths of EM radiation: a limited interval is shown in Fig. 2.2, ranging from longer wavelengths (Microwaves) to shorter (XRays). A fundamental physical property of EM waves is the frequency Î½, which relates to the wavelength through the relation c = Î½ Â· Î», where c is the speed of EM waves in vacuum. The classic picture of light as EM waves can be revisited in the perspective of the quantum theory. In its simplest form, the theory describes light as the"

Since the photon couples directly to the electric charge of quarks, we can study hadron structures and QCD physics, eï¬ectively, in hadron production induced by two-photon collisions. The even C-parity of the twophoton system is complementary with the odd C-parity in e+ eâ collisions. In an e+ eâ collider, a virtual photon is emitted from each lepton; a collision of these photons produces final-state particles as shown in Figure 22.1.1. The two-photon center-of-mass (CM) energy, W , which is the same as the invariant mass of the final-state system, is continuously distributed between zero and just below the e+ eâ CM energy. For practical purposes, the usable range is between a few 100 MeV and â¼ 4.5 GeV. The lower side is limited by experimental trigger conditions and the upper by the luminosity and backgrounds from e+ eâ annihilation events."

305,120,0.404,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"interpretation is a way of trying to explain how the mathematical theory relates to reality. Perhaps, at some point there will be an insightful genius like Bell who can show that the different interpretations lead to different conclusions that can be experimentally differentiated, and that experiments will then give us some reason for choosing one interpretation over another. But at this point, most physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation. There is no convincing reason not to use this interpretation, so we shall use it without further comment from now on. The final topic of this chapter shows that Bellâs theorem is not just of academic interest. It can actually be used to give a secure way of sharing a key to be used in cryptography. The Ekert Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution In 1991, Artur Ekert proposed a method based on entangled qubits used in Bellâs test. There are many slight variations. We will present a version that uses our presentation of Bellâs result. Alice and Bob receive a stream of qubits. For each pair, Alice receives one and Bob receives the other. The spin states are entangled. They are always â â + â â . If Alice and Bob measure their respective qubit using the same orthonor-"

If through them I have procured at a given moment the best knowledge of the state of the physical object that is possibly attainable in accord with natural laws, then I can turn aside as meaningless any further questioning about the âactual state,â inasmuch as I am convinced that no further observation can extend my knowledge of itâat least, not without an equivalent diminution in some other respect (namely by changing the state, see below).â1 No further justification is given here. A quantum state is thus identified with a maximal co-measurable (or co-preparable) entity. This is based on complementarity: not all conceivable quantum physical properties are co-measurable. (For classical models of complementarity, see, for instance, Mooreâs discrete-valued automaton analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle [373, 446, 499], as well as Wrightâs generalized urn model [578], and partition logics in general [511].) In the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics a state is thus formalized by two entities; some structural elements, and a measure on these elements [520]: (I) equivalently, (i) an orthonormal basis of Hilbert space; (ii) a set of mutually orthogonal projection operators corresponding to an orthonormal basis called context; (iii) a maximal observable, or maximal operator, or maximal transformation whose spectral sum contains the set of mutual orthogonal projection operators from the aforementioned basis; (iv) a maximal Boolean subalgebra [249, 300, 376, 420] of the quantum logic also called a block; (II) as well as a two-valued (0-1) measure (or, used synonymously, valuation, or truth assignment) on all the aforementioned entities, singling out or selecting one of them such that this measure is one on exactly one of them, and zero on all the others."

305,22,0.378,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"know that the photons coming through the first filter are polarized vertically. When measured by the second filter, half of the photons are found to be polarized in the 45Â° direction and half in the 135Â° directions. The ones with 45Â° polarization pass through the filter, and the others are absorbed. The third filter again measures the polarization in the vertical and horizontal directions. The photons entering have 45Â° polarization, and when measured in the vertical and horizontal directions, half will have vertical polarization and half will have horizontal polarization. The filter absorbs the vertically polarized photons and lets through those that are polarized horizontally. Conclusions We started this chapter by saying that classical bits can be represented by everyday objects like switches in the on or off position, but that qubits are generally represented by the spin of electrons or the polarization of photons. Spin and polarization are not nearly so familiar to us and have properties that are quite unlike their classical counterparts. To measure spin, you first have to choose a direction and then measure it in that direction. Spin is quantized: When measured, it gives just two possible answersânot a continuous range of answers. We can assign classical bits to these results. For example, if we obtain an N we can consider it to be the binary digit 0, and if we obtain an S we can consider it to be the binary digit 1. This is exactly how we get answers from a quantum computation. The last stage of the computation is to take a measurement. The result will be one of two things, which will be interpreted as either 0 or 1. Although the actual computation will involve qubits, the final answer will be in terms of classical bits. We have only just started our study, so we are quite limited in what we can do. We can, however, generate random strings of binary digits. The experiment that generated random strings of Ns and Ss can be rewritten as a string of 0s and 1s. Consequently measuring spins of electrons first in the vertical and then in the horizontal direction gives a random string of 0s and 1s. This is probably the simplest thing that we can do with qubits, but surprisingly this is something that cannot be done with a classical computer. Classical computers are deterministic. They can compute strings that pass various tests for randomness, but these are pseudorandom, not"

These states depend on the result of the first personâs measurement. This is quite unlike our everyday experience. Later we will see clever ways of exploiting entangled qubits, but first we consider superluminal communication. Superluminal Communication Superluminal communication is communication faster than the speed of light. Two apparently contradictory inferences seem to be able to be deduced concerning this. The first is that Einsteinâs special theory of relativity tells us that as you travel faster, approaching the speed of light, time slows down. If you could travel at the speed of light, time stops.

372,1955,0.374,Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy : Third Edition (Edition 3),"17.6.3 Optical Intensity Interferometer The use of the intensity interferometer for optical measurements on stars was demonstrated by Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1956a), shortly after the success of the radio intensity interferometer described in Sects. 1.3.7 and 17.1. At that time, the possibility of coherence between photons in different light rays from the same source was questioned, and the physical basis and consistency with quantum mechanics is explained by Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1956c) and Purcell (1956). The laboratory demonstration of the correlation of intensity fluctuations of light by Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1956b) led to the appreciation of the phenomenon of photon bunching and to the broader development of quantum statistical studies and to their application to particle beams as well as electromagnetic radiation (Henny et al. 1999). In the optical intensity interferometer, a photomultiplier tube at the focus of each telescope mirror replaces the RF and IF stages and the detectors of the radio instrument. The photomultiplier outputs are amplified and fed to the inputs of the correlator. The optical intensity interferometer is largely insensitive to atmospheric phase fluctuations, as explained for the radio case in Sect. 17.1. The size of the lightgathering apertures is therefore unrestricted by the scale size of the irregularities. Also, it is not necessary that the reflecting mirrors produce a diffraction-limited image, and their accuracy need only be sufficient to deliver all the light to the photomultiplier cathodes. This is fortunate since the low sensitivity mentioned earlier for the radio case necessitates the use of large light-gathering areas. Hanbury Brown (1974) gave an analysis of the response of the optical instrument and showed that it is proportional to the square of the visibility modulus as in the radio case. Either a correlator or a photon coincidence counter can be used to combine the photomultiplier outputs. The intensity interferometer constructed at Narrabri, Australia (Hanbury Brown et al. 1967; Hanbury Brown 1974), used two 6.5-m-diameter reflectors and a bandwidth of 60 MHz for the signals at the correlator inputs. The resulting limiting magnitude of +2.5 enabled measurements of 32 stars to be made. Davis (1976) has discussed the relative merits of the intensity interferometer and modern implementations of the Michelson interferometer for development of more sensitive instruments."

We now ask what happens if Alice and Bob change the direction in which they are measuring. For example, what happens if they both ask whether the hands are pointing to four? We know that the clocks will answer that the hands are pointing either toward four or to ten, but will Alice and Bob get exactly the same answer? Are both answers equally likely? First, we give an intuitive argument for two qubits in the entangled state 1 ï£®1 ï£¹ ï£® 0 ï£¹ 1 ï£® 0 ï£¹ ï£®1 ï£¹ 2 ï£¯ï£°0 ï£ºï£» ï£¯ï£°1 ï£ºï£» 2 ï£¯ï£°1 ï£ºï£» ï£¯ï£°0 ï£ºï£» Two electrons might represent this state. Suppose that Alice and Bob measure the spin of their electrons in direction 0Â°. If Alice gets N, Bob gets S. If Alice gets S, Bob gets N. As we mentioned earlier, this might represent two electrons in an atom where the spins cancel. But we would expect the spins to cancel in every direction, so we would expect that if Alice and Bob chose a new basis for measurements they would still get spins in the opposite direction. Symmetry also seems to imply that both directions should be equally likely. This intuitive argument leads us to conjecture that if we have entangled qubits in the state 1 ï£®1 ï£¹ ï£®1 ï£¹ 1 ï£® 0 ï£¹ ï£® 0 ï£¹ 2 ï£¯ï£°1 ï£ºï£» ï£¯ï£°1 ï£ºï£» 2 ï£¯ï£°0 ï£ºï£» ï£¯ï£°0 ï£ºï£» and then rewrite this state using a new orthonormal basis ( b0 , b1 ), we b0 â b0 + b1 â b1 .

Similar requirements are also useful in the single-tag cases described below to ensure a small Q2 for the untagged photon. 22.1.4 Single-tag measurements When one of the scattered electrons is detected, we refer to these two-photon processes as single-tag modes. In the single-tag process, we can probe the structure of the real photon or a hadron with a high-Q2 photon; this process is very useful for studies of hadron and QCD physics such as meson transition form factors (Brodsky and Lepage, 1981).

How Do You Entangle Qubits? This book is about the mathematics that underlies quantum computing. It is not about how to physically create a quantum computer. We are not going to spend much time on the details of physical experiments, but the question of how physicists create entangled particles is such an important one that we will briefly address it. We can represent entangled qubits by either entangled photons or electrons. Though we often say the particles are entangled, what we really mean is that the vector describing their states, a tensor in ï2 â ï2 , is entangled. The actual particles are separate and, as we have just noted, can be very far apart. That said, the question remains: How do you go about creating a pair of particles whose state vector is entangled? First, we look at how physical experiments create entangled particles. Then we look at how quantum gates create entangled qubits. The most commonly used method at this time involves photons. The process is called spontaneous parametric down-conversion. A laser beam sends photons through a special crystal. Most of the photons just pass through, but some photons split into two. Energy and momentum must be conservedâthe total energy and momentum of the two resulting photons must equal the energy and momentum of the initial photon. The conservation laws guarantee that the state describing the polarization of the two photons is entangled. In the universe, electrons are often entangled.

213,16,0.355,Collider Physics Within The Standard Model : a Primer,"one (or occasionally more than one) photon emitted by one electron and reabsorbed by the other. Similarly, in theN SM there are 8 gluons associated with the SU.3/ colour generators, while for SU.2/ U.1/ there are four gauge bosons W C , W , Z 0 , and â. Of these, only the gluons and the photon â are massless, because the symmetry induced by the other three generators is actually spontaneously broken. The masses of W C , W , and Z 0 are very large indeed on the scale of elementary particles, with values mW  80:4 GeV and mZ  91:2 GeV, whence they are as heavy as atoms of intermediate size, like rubidium and molybdenum, respectively. In the electroweak theory, the breaking of the symmetry is of a particular type, referred to as spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this case, charges and currents are as dictated by the symmetry, but the fundamental state of minimum energy, the vacuum, is not unique and there is a continuum of degenerate states that all respect the symmetry (in the sense that the whole vacuum orbit is spanned by applying the symmetry transformations). The symmetry breaking is due to the fact that the system (with infinite volume and an infinite number of degrees of freedom) is found in one particular vacuum state, and this choice, which for the SM occurred in the first instants of the life of the Universe, means that the symmetry is violated in the spectrum of states. In a gauge theory like the SM, the spontaneous symmetry breaking is realized by the Higgs mechanism [189, 236, 243, 261] (described in detail in Sect. 1.7): there are a number of scalar (i.e., zero spin) Higgs bosons with a potential that produces an orbit of degenerate vacuum states. One or more of these scalar Higgs particles must necessarily be present in the spectrum of physical states with masses very close to the range so far explored. The Higgs particle has now been found at the LHC with mH  126 GeV [341, 345], thus making a big step towards completing the experimental verification of the SM. The Higgs boson acts as the mediator of a new class of interactions which, at the tree level, are coupled in proportion to the particle masses and thus have a very different strength for, say, an electron and a top quark. The fermionic matter fields of the SM are quarks and leptons (all of spin 1/2). Each type of quark is a colour triplet (i.e., each quark flavour comes in three colours) and also carries electroweak charges, in particular electric charges C2=3 for up-type quarks and 1=3 for down-type quarks. So quarks are subject to all SM interactions. Leptons are colourless and thus do not interact strongly (they are not hadrons) but have electroweak charges, in particular electric charges 1 for charged leptons (e ,  and Â£ ) and charge 0 for neutrinos (Äe , Ä and ÄÂ£ ). Quarks and leptons are grouped in 3 âfamiliesâ or âgenerationsâ with equal quantum numbers but different masses.

Feinberg actively promoted the statistical and hydrodynamical concepts and at the 1970 Kiev conference he first proposed [5] the photon and dilepton signatures (the so-called direct photons and dileptons) of the early stage of the quarkgluon matter (see his summary of 1976 [6]). Namely, these particles could escape from hadronic medium being in comparison almost non-interacting and, therefore, provide important information about its properties. Many experimental papers aiming to detect such radiation and to confront its properties with theoretical prediction appeared afterwards. The theory was extended to include parton based processes and production of psions (cNc D  ) [7]. E.L. (as we called him) often corresponded with Rolf Hagedorn, and also with Peter Carruthers, discussing with them statistical and hydrodynamic approaches which were out of the mainstream of theory research at that time. One had to wait long for experimental data on AA collisions before this approach to strong interactions was recognized."

275,354,0.348,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"on a matter, requires changing from one point of view to another, and the two points of view can imply incompatibility. In other words, the uncertainty principle entails that it is not possible to be simultaneously decided on both the image and content with respect to assessing trustworthiness. Just like it is not possible to form a joint probability of both the position and momentum of a quantum particle, it is not possible for the human participant to form a joint probability across decisions, e.g., whether they both trust the image and the content of the image. Not being able to form joint probabilities signals the presence of contextuality. A well studied example of contextuality is the curious phenomenon of entanglement: Empirical observations are collected in four measurement settings of a system of two quantum particles such as photons. Each of the four settings yields a pairwise joint probability distribution which models the observations made in that measurement setting. An entangled system is deemed âcontextual"" because it is not possible to combine these four pairwise joint probability distributions into a single probabilistic model such that the four pairwise empirical distributions are marginal distributions of this global model. Even though contextuality manifests within the sub-atomic realm, there is a growing body of research which is exploring whether contextuality manifests in cognition and related areas (e.g., [1, 2, 8, 9, 16, 17]). In the context of our example, contextuality arises because the image and content decision perspectives cannot be meaningfully combined into a single joint distribution."

235,80,0.343,"Physical (A)Causality : Determinism, Randomness and Uncaused Events (Volume 192.0)","Indeed, already Sommerfeld had warned his students not to get into these issues, and Feynman [211, p. 129] predicted the âperpetual torment that results from [[the question]], âBut how can it be like that?â which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see [[quantum mechanics]] in terms of an analogy with something familiar.â Therefore he advised his audience, âDo not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, âBut how can it be like that?â because you will get âdown the drainâ, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped.â But heresy has continued. Clauser [of the ClauserâHorneâShimonyâHolt (CHSH) inequalities [145]], in a noteworthy paper [144], pointed out the dogmatism of âevangelical theoreticians . . . their ecumenical leadership, and especially given Bohrâs strong leadership, the net legacy of their arguments is that the overwhelming majority of the physics community accepted Bohrâs âCopenhagenâ interpretation as gospel, and totally rejected Einsteinâs viewpoint.â At some point Clauser got thrown out of the office by the impatient Feynman (who often liked to market himself as âcoolâ). âA very powerful . . . stigma began to develop within the physics community towards anyone who sacrilegiously was critical of quantum theoryâs fundamentals. . . . The net impact of this stigma was that any physicist who openly criticized or even seriously questioned these foundations (or predictions) was immediately branded as a âquack.â â Clauser continues by noticing, âTo be sure, there remained alive a minority of the theoryâs founders (notably Einstein, SchrÃ¶dinger, and de Broglie) who were still critical of the theoryâs foundations. These men were obviously not quacks. Indeed, they all had Nobel Prizes! Instead, gossip among physicists branded these men âsenile.â â As time passed by, another, more optimistic phase of the perception of quantum foundations followed, which, however, might not have sufficiently and critically reflected the previous evangelical theoreticiansâ orthodoxy. On the contrary, quantum mechanics has been marketed to the public and to policy makers alike as a hocuspocus type capacity [522]. This author believes [504] that interpretation is to the formalism what a scaffolding in architecture and building construction is to the completed building. Very often the scaffolding has to be erected because it is an indispensable part of the building process. Once the completed building is in place, the scaffolding is torn down and the opus stands in its own full glory. No need for auxiliary scaffold any more. But beware of those technicians who claim to be able to erect skyscrapers without any of those poles and planks! In addition, when it comes to claims of applicability of the formalism, and its ontological commitments, the suppression of semantic content in favour of mere syntax makes us vulnerable: in many ways the formalism could be extended to domains in which it cannot be applied safely and properly. Thereby, the resulting certifications, alleged capacities and predictions could be wrong. Hence, if it comes to utilize the formalism, interpretation serves not only as scaffolding, but also provides guiding principles and precautionary methods of evaluation and application."
235,97,0.342,"Physical (A)Causality : Determinism, Randomness and Uncaused Events (Volume 192.0)","12.1 The Quantum Canon At the moment, there exists a loosely bundled canon of quantum rules subsumed under the term quantum mechanics or quantum theory. It includes reversible as well as irreversible processes, and is prima facie inconsistent. As already von Neumann [552, 554] and later Everett [30, 206, 545] noted, there cannot be any irreversible measurement process nested in a ubiquitous uniformly reversible evolution of the quantum state. Both von Neumann and Everett called the former, irreversible, discontinuous change the âprocess 1â; and the latter, reversible, continuous, deterministic change the âprocess 2,â respectively. Stated differently, there cannot exist any irreversible many-to-one measurement scenario (other than pragmatic fappness) in a reversible one-to-one environment. Hence, if one wants to maintain irreversible measurements, then (at least within the quantum formalism) one is faced with the following dilemma: either quantum mechanics must be augmented with some irreversible, many-to-one state evolution, thereby spoiling the ubiquitous, universal reversible one-to-one state evolution; or the assumption of the co-existence of a ubiquitous, uniform reversible one-to-one state evolution on the one hand with some irreversible many-to-one âwave function collapse,â (by another wording, âreduction of the state vectorâ) throughout measurement on the other hand, yields a complete contradiction. How is such a situation handled in other areas? Every system of logic which is self-contradictory (inconsistent) â such that a proposition as well as its negation is postulated; or can be derived from the postulates â in particular, in a formal axiomatic system, is detrimental and disastrous. Because by the principle of explosion (Latin: ex falso quodlibet) any invocation of a statement as well as of its negation yields every proposition true. This can be motivated by supposing that both âPâ as well as ânot Pâ are true. Then the proposition âP or anythingâ is true (because at least âPâ is true). Now suppose that also ânot Pâ holds. But then, in order for âP or anythingâ to be true, âanythingâ needs to be true. However, if anything is derivable, then such a system lacks any descriptive or predictive capacity. In this Â© The Author(s) 2018 K.

Laser radiation presents both spatial and temporal coherence. The former refers to the property that the phase difference measured between any pair of points on the wavefront is uniform. Similarly, temporal coherence indicates that the phase of a wave remains constant through time. The coherence of laser light is a direct result of the stimulated emission process, as the emitted photons present the same phase, frequency and direction of stimulating photons [2]. It can be shown that high temporal coherence entails a narrow emission spectrum [2]âthis explains why laser devices appear to produce nearly monochromatic light. Typical values of frequency spread âÎ½ (Fig. 2.6) for a laser range from 1 GHz down to a few Hertz, depending on the properties of the active medium and the design of the cavity. Laser devices are commonly described by the wavelength Î» associated with the center Î½0 of their emission spectrum. For instance, most medical carbon dioxide (CO2 ) lasers present an emission in the mid-infrared range, centered at 10.6 Âµm [5]."
213,360,0.337,Collider Physics Within The Standard Model : a Primer,"3.17 Limitations of the Standard Model No signal of new physics has been found, either by direct production of new particles at the LHC, or in the electroweak precision tests, or in flavour physics. Given the success of the SM, why are we not satisfied with this theory? Once the Higgs particle has been found, why donât we declare particle physics closed? The reason is that there are both conceptual problems and phenomenological indications for physics beyond the SM. On the conceptual side the most obvious problems are that quantum gravity is not included in the SM and that the famous hierarchy (or naturalness or fine-tuning) problem remains open. Among the main phenomenological hints for new physics we can list coupling unification, dark matter, neutrino masses (discussed in Sect. 3.7), baryogenesis, and the cosmological vacuum energy. At accelerator experiments, the most plausible departure from the SM is the muon anomalous magnetic moment which, as discussed in Sect. 3.9, shows a deviation by about 3 , but some caution should be applied since a large fraction of the uncertainty is of theoretical origin, in particular that due to the hadronic contribution to lightâlight scattering [245]. The computed evolution with energy of the effective SM gauge couplings clearly points towards the unification of the electroweak and strong forces (GUTs) at scales of energy MGUT  1015 â1016 GeV [315], which are close to the scale of quantum gravity, MPlanck  1019 GeV.

And we have to make sure that we do not over-represent physical facts by formalisms which contain elements which have no correspondence to the former. Because if we are not careful enough we fall pray of Jaynesâ Mind Projection Fallacy mentioned in Sect. 9.5 (p. 42). Another issue is the applicability of mathematical models or methods which somehow implicity or explicitly rely on infinities. For instance, Cantorâs diagonalization technique which is often used to prove the undenumerability of the real unit interval relies on an infinite process [79] which is nonoperational. Again the issue of supertasks mentioned earlier arises. It may not be totally unjustified to consider the question of whether or not theoretical physics should allow for such infinities unsettled. The issue has been raised already by Eleatic philosophy [253, 331, 440], and may be with us forever."

On the lighter side, we recall that only when MÃ¼nchhausen has yanked very strongly at his hair, was he able to move, and then not only himself, but taking with him the swamp, and the Earthâthe whole world. (c) It is noteworthy that in the realm of todayâs particle physics (or High Energy Physicsâwe have seen that these two terms mean the same) no evidence is found that the existing principles of relativity and of quantum theory need to be corrected or extended in any way; even though we are in a new situation. (d) After my report, it might seem as if the end of elementary particle physics has come. However, what I have presented arises from speculative hypothesis. And even if everything were correct, we would not come to an end, but find ourselves at a new beginning: in all the above considerations only strong interactions were considered, and not in terms of particular form of forces, but only in terms of the ever-changing composition of the âelementary particles,â and we have never spoken about their individual characteristicsâtherefore our conclusions were completely independent of all these additional known particle properties. Thus we have described the average behavior, the statistical behavior. But the main focus of high energy physics is precisely on all these more detailed individual properties of the new particles and the forces acting between them. And there is the question, why these forces? In this regard we stand at a new beginning. (e) Many physicists still believe in the possibility of exploring deeper and further to ever more elementary building blocks. One must follow this line experimentally and cannot be misled by intellectually satisfying speculation into believing that the scientific question is settled. (f) I have tried to describe everything in everyday language, in words, that we physicists use, when we talk about such things at tea. To you, the reader, everything must look very mysterious, especially the claim that each âelementary particleâ in different ways has been created from all the others. Take it to be âasif-speechâ, as a blurry image of what can be formulated much more precisely with the help of mathematics or technical jargon. With this report I also, as an aside, hope I have made you understand why we high energy physicists yearn so much for the next European 300-GeV accelerator, which will now probably be built."

For example, analogous leptonic transitions like  ! eâ or Â£ ! â also exist, but in the SM are extremely small and out of reach for experiments, because the tiny neutrino masses enter into the GIM suppression factor. But new physics effects could well make these rare lepton flavour-violating processes accessible to experiment.

305,8,0.329,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"All computations involve inputting data, manipulating it according to certain rules, and then outputting the final answer. For classical computations, the bit is the basic unit of data. For quantum computations, this unit is the quantum bitâusually shortened to qubit. A classical bit corresponds to one of two alternatives. Anything that can be in exactly one of two states can represent a bit. Later we will see various examples, which include the truth or falsity of a logical statement, a switch being in the on or off position, and even the presence or absence of a billiard ball. A qubit, like a bit, includes these two alternatives, butâquite unlike a bitâit can also be in a combination of these two states. What does this mean? What exactly is a combination of two states, and what are physical objects that can represent qubits? What is the quantum computation analog to the switch? A qubit can be represented by the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon. This, though true, does not seem particularly helpful as spins of electrons and polarizations of photons are not things that most of us have knowledge about, let alone experience with. Letâs start with a basic introduction to describe spin and polarization. To do this we describe the foundational experiment performed by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach on the spin of silver atoms. In 1922, Niels Bohrâs planetary model described the current understanding of atoms. In this model an atom consisted of a positive nucleus orbited by negative electrons. These orbits were circular and were constrained to certain radii. The innermost orbit could contain at most two electrons. Once this was filled, electrons would start filling the next level, where at most eight electrons could be held. Silver atoms have 47 electrons. Two of"

Within IoT-A, we tried to provide guidelines for developments in some areas, such as protocols; however, as long-term forecasts are very often off-target, only time will tell exactly which areas will need closer attention. Last, but certainly not least, a considerable amount of work must be done to develop sustainable security and privacy policies. Even before the IoT, RFID technologies were subject to a very negative âbig brotherâ image. These considerations are very topical today, with the disclosure of the US governmentâs PRISM program, and any technology for interconnected objects may be rejected on the basis that it violates basic privacy principles. Therefore, governance schemes that on one hand are privacy-friendly, and on the other hand secure, must be agreed upon and implemented, along with widespread education on the societal benefits of IoT."

Nesting can be iterated ad infinitum (or rather, ad nauseam), like a Russian doll of arbitrary depth, to put forward the idea that somebodyâs observer-cut-object conceptualization can be another agentâs object. This can go on forever; until such time as one is convinced that, from the point of view of nesting, measurement is purely conventional; and suspended in a never-ending sequence of observer-cut-object layers of description. The thrust of nesting lies in the fact that it demonstrates quite clearly that extrinsic observers are purely fictional and illusory, although they may fapp exist. Moreover, irreversibility can only fapp emerge if the observer and the object are subject to uniform reversible motion. Strictly speaking, irreversibility is (provable) impossible for uniformly one-to-one evolutions. This (yet not fapp) eliminates the principle possibility for âirreversible measurementâ in quantum mechanics. Of course, it is still possible to obtain strict irreversibility through the addition of some many-to-one process, such as nonlinear evolution: for instance, the function f (x) = x 2 maps both x and âx into the same value."

311,1679,0.307,The Physics of the B Factories,"based on analysis of a data sample of 395 fbâ1 (Uehara, 2006). The resonance is observed in two-photon production, a mechanism providing a clean environment for studying resonances in direct formation (see Chapter 22 for the details), both in Î³Î³ â D0D0 and Î³Î³ â D+Dâ (see Fig. 18.2.5 (a) and (b), respectively). The final state charmed mesons are fully reconstructed. Twophoton events are separated from e+ eâ annihilation and ISR events by requiring that the transverse momentum of the DD system be small, as expected for two-photon events in the no-tag mode (i.e., where neither the outgoing electron nor the positron are detected). The resulting combined invariant mass distribution is fitted with a relativistic Breit-Wigner signal function (taking the mass resolution and reconstruction eï¬ciency into account) and a background component (Fig. 18.2.5 (c)). The statistical significance of the Z(3930) peak is 5.3 Ï. The measured mass and total width of the resonance are listed in Table 18.2.3. The systematic uncertainties are dominated by uncertainties in the D mass and the choice of the signal function lineshape. Belle performs an angular analysis to identify the spin of the observed resonance. If one defines Î¸ as the angle of a D meson relative to the beam axis in the Î³Î³ frame (equivalent to the DD frame), the cos Î¸ distribution for a scalar particle will be flat, while for a spin-2 resonance produced with helicity 2 along the incident axis, a distribution proportional to sin4 Î¸ is expected. Spin-1 is largely suppressed in two-photon events with quasi-real photons (Yang, 1950), thus this assignment is not considered. The Belle data significantly favor spin-2 over spin-0 assignment, while the production and decay mechanisms require positive parity and C-parity. The resulting quantum numbers, J P C = 2++ , suggest identifying this particle with the previously unobserved Ïc2 (2P ) charmonium state. Assuming production of a spin-2 state, Belle calculated the product of its two-photon width and the branching fraction into DD (Table 18.2.3). The systematic errors are primarily due to uncertainties in tracking and particle identification eï¬ciencies, the choice of fit lineshapes and the errors of D branching fractions."
8,305,0.306,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","16.3 Is the Question About the âFinal Building Blockâ Meaningless? There is the final question that remains: suppose, that everything were correct; there is an infinite number and an exponential mass spectrum of new types of particles and a corresponding limiting temperatureâwhat does that have to do with the here presented end situation, which nevertheless does not mean an end? Here we enter into a theoretical construction wherein one abstracts a general rule from a limited number of experimental data, which is then tentatively postulated as a universal principle. This introduces us to the usual practical circumstance of theoretical physics: we have a model whose other properties are analytically derived using established methods of mathematics and the assumptions that generally apply to the already known laws of nature. In this way we obtain experimentally testable predictions as derived from known or later verifiable behavior. Agreement of these predictions with the facts is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure that the theoretical model is correct. This applies especially to the model I will now describe. In order to introduce the model in words, I will characterize the situation far less exactly than the technical tools of theoretical physics would allow me to do this. I proceed in this way as I seek at all cost to avoid technical jargon. In a high-energy collision new material particles are copiously produced (events with a multiplicity of a hundred or more have been observed). In our terminology, these particles emerge from the collision-produced boiling primordial matter. In a certain and physically quite precise sense they were all contained in this piece of boiling primal matter. Taking one of these newly generated particles under the microscope (which is not easy: lifespan '10 23 s), we observe that it behaves itself as boiling primordial matter; namely it can decay further into many particles. The greater its mass, the greater is this tendency. Such a particle with a large mass thus has a dual nature: on the one hand, it can be used as an âelementary particleâ contributing to radiative energy equilibrium, on the other hand it can itself create other âelementary particlesâ which contribute to the radiative energy equilibrium. Seen from this perspective, none of these produced particle types can be viewed as an elementary particle, given that other particles can emanate from any of the produced particles, which are again no more elementary since each can be simultaneously created out of the other, and in this way all these particles have undetermined building block composition. Nothing in this picture changes if one day quarks should be confirmed as the primordial building blocks. In our approach they would play a preferential role, being the stuff from which âeverything is built.â As an aside, it is the virtue of our approach that the statement âcomposed ofâ does not characterize the number and the character of the fundamental building blocks. The composition and nature of the source of produced particles can remain cloaked in mystery; it can remain undetermined. The model aims to overcome the limited number of presently known types of particles by continuing the observed behavior of the mass spectrum at low mass to higher mass, (where we experimentally know nothing yet). Once this is"

192,337,0.298,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Solar quite convincingly explains how, as a young researcher, Michael Beard had been an isolated, introverted, highly committed, hyper-individual quantum physicist. As an ageing scientist, however, his situation has completely changed. A new arena of âconverging researchâ has emerged, in the intermediate zone between nano-technology, photovoltaics and climate politics. From the 1950s onwards, physicists (with their high-tech contrivances and advanced mathematics) migrated towards the life sciences, employing their powerful physical technologies to understand and mimic the basic processes of life. Artificial photosynthesis, as a sub-field of biomimesis (i.e. the use of biotechnology to mimic living nature on the molecular level), is an exemplification of this trend. Thus, the epistemological backdrop of the narrative is a transformation that is actually taking place in laboratories world-wide, where biotechnology is evolving into bio-mimesis, i.e. mimicking (âcopy-pastingâ) nature on a molecular scale (Church and Regis 2012; Zwart et al. 2015; Blok and Gremmen 2016). In principle, this biomimetic turn entails a positive ambition. The aim is to develop technologies which, although highly advanced, are nonetheless more sustainable and naturefriendly than the technologies which humankind managed to produce so far. Indeed, artificial photosynthesis basically aims to see plant leaves as biological factories from which human technology still has a lot to learn in terms of efficiency, sustainability and circularity. Nature is the paradigm, the teacher (natura artis magistra) for molecular life scientists and bioengineers, notably on the quantum or nanoscale. The down-side is that there is a lot of investment, prestige and politics involved in this type of research, so that it runs the risk of becoming tainted by privatisation, commercialisation and politicisation. This transformation (presented in Solar as an emerging scientific-industrial ârevolutionâ, p. 36, p. 211, p. 336; as a ânew chapter in the history of industrial civilisationâ, p. 293) is quite credibly reflected in the novel, and it is clear that author Ian McEwan has conducted a considerable amount of preparatory research.1 Although Beard is said to hold âan irrational prejudice against physicists who defected to biology, SchrÃ¶dinger, Crick and the likeâ (p. 121), he basically follows in their footsteps, moving from âpureâ quantum physics2 to âappliedâ molecular life sciences research. Yet, the most dramatic discontinuity in his career is not the shift from basic physics (studying photons and electrons) to biomimesis, but from original research"
360,317,0.295,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"Poortman et al. (2017). These examples help us observe common principles in the complex interplay between acceptability and typicality. Example 1 HAIR In one of Leeâs experiments (Lee, 2017: Fig. 5.4), participants were shown a picture of hair that was atypically dyed focal red. 87% of the participants accepted this picture as an instance of the concept RED HAIR. Therefore, we may reasonably conclude that the stimulus was quite acceptable as an instance of HAIR.7 However, in a color preference task for the concept HAIR, only 24% of the participants preferred focal red to a more natural hue for hair (RGB value: 201,113,13). In accordance with naive intuition, we may conclude that hair that is dyed focal red is an acceptable instance of HAIR, but is atypical for the category. Example 2 SHAKE In one of Kerem et al.âs experiments, participants were shown two pictures of a man shaking infant beds (Fig. 2a, b), as well as an incomplete transitive sentence âthe man is shaking (something)â.8 Although both pictures clearly show the man doing the activity reported in the sentence, 87% of the participants preferred Fig. 2a as a âbetter illustration for the sentenceâ. We conclude that a situation with two patients is an atypical instance of the concept SHAKE, despite its high acceptability. Example 3 WALK and WRITE In one of the experiments by Poortman (2017), participants were instructed to rate the oddness of a situation where a person walks and writes at the same time. 7 Lee did not directly check the degree of acceptability for HAIR .

Einstein and Local Realism Gravity provides a good example to explain local realism. Newtonâs law of gravity gives a formula that tells us the strength of the force between two masses. If you plug in the size of the masses, the distance they are apart, and the gravitational constant, the formula gives the size of the attractive force. Newtonâs law transformed physics. It can be used, for example, to show that a planet orbiting a star moves in an elliptical orbit. But though it tells us the value of the force, it does not tell us the mechanism that connects the planet to the sun. Although Newtonâs law of gravitation was useful for calculations, it did not explain how gravity worked. Newton, himself, was concerned about"
192,158,0.294,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"The main protagonist of the novel, however, is Mark Ampter, who actually resembles Haakon Chevalier in various respects. Ampter works at Berkeley University, becomes an active member of a Marxist unit (of which Sebastian is the most inspirational member), joins the Berkeley branch of the teachersâ union (a communist front organisation) and becomes involved in various other leftist causes, â all this closely corresponds with Chevalierâs own biography. Moreover, Mark Ampter and his wife Eve (Barbara Chevalier) become close friends of the Bloch couple. And finally, in Chevalierâs novel, there is a crucial scene about miscommunication: the garden scene, the turning point in the novel, uncannily reminiscent of the Chevalier Incident. When Mark seems finally able to pass a secret message (allegedly coming from German scientists) which he was requested to communicate to Bloch, the latter suggests to step out into the garden, away from hidden microphones (knowing that otherwise the conversation would be taped). Oppenheimer (Bloch) was fully aware of being under more or less constant observation. Virtually everything he said was being monitored. Unfortunately, their conversation (meant to straighten things out) was interrupted (in real life Kitty was impatiently waiting for the arrival of the martinis, and in the novel Tanya urged Sebastian to come and entertain his guests), never to be taken up again. Another remarkable similarity between Mark Ampter and Haakon Chevalier is that for both, the university job was basically a cover. Chevalier used it for his communist activism, Ampter for reporting on Bloch, which also highlights the most remarkable difference between both men. For instead of being a communist, Mark Ampter is actually working as a secret agent. His assignment is to infiltrate the radical left-wing milieu of scientists at Berkeley in order to observe âthe mechanism of subversion, disruption and sabotageâ from the inside (p. 88). His first and foremost objective, however, is to report on Sebastian Bloch. Berkeley campus is basically a breeding ground for subversive activities (both according to the Communist Party and according to the Secret Service) and Bloch is regarded as one of the key actors hunting for converts, thus spreading the infection. His influence is âpoisonâ, as Gospodin Gregg (Ampterâs chief) phrases it (p. 165). In the context of his assignment, Mark Ampter produces an enormous pile of reports concerning Bloch and his entourage (comparable to the 3000 typewritten pages produced by the FBI used as evidence during the Oppenheimer hearings). In other words, Chevalier and Ampter represent opposite extremes of the political spectrum: Chevalier as a member of the Communist Party (receiving instructions from Moscow), Ampter as an employee of the (anti-communist) secret service (operating from Washington). Chevalier himself figured high on the watch-list of secret intelligence agencies as a possible Soviet spy. But although being political opposites, the Communist party and the secret service are both organisations that are shrouded in secrecy and actually mirror one another. Communists are monitored and at times harassed, not only by the secret service, but also by their own organisation. In the novel, both organisations devote much of their time and resources to enrolling (and monitoring) new recruits, infiltrating various movements to achieve this. Both the secret service and the communist party are organisations of the Big Brother-type: taking over peopleâs lives while collecting potentially damaging information about individual members for possible"

What, also, would the multiplicities of the secondaries be? And how would these be distributed in phase space? Furthermore, how could we recognize the existence of a QGP during the interaction and how valid would an enhancement of strangeparticle production be as a diagnostic tool for QGP? Which effects could distort the measurement and simulate a phase transition? At that point we went for advice to Hagedorn, who had studied those subjects [14]. He patiently discussed these matters with us and gave much useful advice. For the questions about strangeness, however, Hagedorn suggested that we contact directly Johann Rafelski who, he said, would be delighted to discuss that issue with us! This echoed the advice we got from LÃ©on Van Hove, a former CERN director general, also a strong supporter of the new research program. Indeed, Johann was delighted and this was the start of a long and friendly collaboration. Our first two experiments, WA85 and WA94, took data at 200 A GeV in a sulfur beam, using the ââbutterfly chambersâ. They were followed by two lead-beam experiments WA97 and NA57. The latter was a North-Area experiment with a new spectrometer and a new spokesperson: Federico Antinori. Both the latter two experiments made use of the Silicon Pixel telescope as their main tracking device. The experiments confirmed our hopes. We found that the abundances of multistrange baryons and anti-baryons produced in heavy-ion collisions were indeed enhanced [15]. Moreover, these enhancements increased with the strangeness content of the produced baryon [15, 16]. For example, in central lead-lead collisions, the rare Ë particles carrying three units of strangeness were enhanced by a factor twenty! A behavior expected to ensue from the appearance of a deconfined phase during the interaction [6]. Similar results were subsequently obtained by many other experiments. These results constituted one of the main pieces of evidence for the formation of a new state of matter at the CERN-SPS energies, which CERN announced in a press release in February 2000. More on this topic is reported in Chap. 33. Another interesting finding, suggesting a thermal production for s and sN quarks [17] was the similarity of the slopes of the transverse mass spectra between strange baryons and corresponding antibaryons [18]. An observation which did indeed please Hagedorn! With this last example, I conclude my brief review of the influence that Rolf Hagedorn, together with his disciples and continuators, had on the CERN heavy-ion program and on our physics choices."

(8) The men are lying down and drinking (9) The men are waving and drawing If Winterâs extended SMH is correct in assuming that non-intersective interpretations are only available when intersective interpretations are strictly ruled out by the predicates, then these sentences would only allow an intersective interpretation. As I will show in the current chapter, non-intersective, âsplitâ interpretations are readily available to many speakers for sentences like (4), (8) and (9), even though the predicates do not strictly exclude an intersective one. For example, it may be exceptional, but it is possible for a person to wave and draw simultaneously. Several previous works have recognized a similar problem for the SMH concerning reciprocal sentences that receive weaker interpretations than predicted (e.g. Winter 2001; Philip, 2000; Kerem et al. 2009; Poortman et al. 2017). For example, both Kerem et al. (2009) and Poortman et al.

By putting mirrors in the appropriate places and adding delays, we can construct the gate so that the outputs are lined up with the inputs and when balls enter at the same time they leave at the same time. (This is depicted in figure 6.22.) We can then form circuits that contain more than one Fredkin gate.* Since the Fredkin gate is universal, it can be used to construct any boolean circuit. Consequently, any boolean circuit can be constructed using just billiard balls and mirrors. Fredkin believes that the universe is a computer. He didnât convince Feynman of this, but the billiard ball computer did impress him. As they both realized, any slight error in the position or velocity of a ball would result in an error that would propagate and get amplified. Collisions are never perfectly elastic; there is always friction and heat is lost. The billiard ball computer is clearly just a theoretical machine, not something that can be constructed in practice. But this machine does conjure images of atoms bouncing off one another, and it led Feynman to consider gates based on quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics. We look at this idea in the next chapter. * There is a great animation showing this gate with balls entering and leaving on the website http://www.bubblycloud.com/billiard/fredkin-from-switches.html."
305,124,0.292,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"We take Feynmanâs approach. It turns out that reversible gates are exactly what we need for quantum computing. The billiard ball computer led Feynman to think of particles interacting instead of balls. It was the inspiration for his work on quantum computing, but we include it here mainly because of its sheer simplicity and ingenuity. Logic In the late nineteenth century George Boole realized that certain parts of logic could be treated algebraicallyâthat there were laws of logic that could be expressed in terms of algebra. We adopt the now standard way of introducing boolean logic by using truth tables for the three basic operations not, and, and or. Negation If a statement is true, then its negation is false, and conversely, if a statement is false, then its negation is true. For example, the statement 2 + 2 = 4 is true, and its negation 2 + 2 â  4 is false. Instead of giving concrete examples of statements, we often let the symbols P, Q, and R stand in for them. So, for example, 2 + 2 = 4 might be represented by P. The symbol Â¬ stands for not; if P represents the statement 2 + 2 = 4, then Â¬P stands for 2 + 2 â  4. We can then summarize the basic properties of negation using our symbols: If P is true, then Â¬P is false. If P is false, then Â¬P is true. To make things even more concise we can use the symbols T and F to denote true and false respectively. We can then define the properties using a table."
82,341,0.291,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"However, if instead we put 12 for v0 in (7.4), we find P(2) q|P(1) (q) = 21 ) = 21 . Therefore P(1) (Â¬q) = 12 , and thus P(1) (q) = 21 . So if (7.4) were unrestrictedly valid, we could prove that the probability of an arbitrary proposition q is equal to one-half, which is absurd. This is known as the Miller paradox. Brian Skyrms has argued against Millerâs reasoning. Although Skyrms maintains that (7.4) is perfectly acceptable, playfully dubbing it âMillerâs Principleâ, he points out that Millerâs further reasoning is fallacious, since it ârests on a simple de reâde dicto confusionâ.3 As Skyrms explains, one and the same expression is used both referentially and attributively, so that a number (here v0 ) is wrongly put on a par with a random variable, here P(1) (Â¬q), that takes on a range of possible values.4 So long as we recognize this confusion and keep the two levels apart, the notion of a second-order probability is harmless, and the Miller paradox disappears. We agree with 2 Miller 1966. 3 Skyrms 1980, 111. 4 See Howson and Urbach 1993, 399-400, who make a similar observation."

Chapters 21 and 22 describe in detail the numerous experimental results obtained at the B Factories, in ISR and two-photon physics respectively. When describing charmonium formation from cc pairs produced either in B decays or in e+ eâ annihilation, eï¬ective field theories are used. The EFT most often exploited is non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), which assumes factorization of the production of charmonium partons (e.g. a cc pair) in the given process, and the formation of charmonium from those partons (Bodwin, Braaten, and Lepage, 1995; Caswell and Lepage, 1986; Thacker and Lepage, 1991). The former part contains a partonic level cross section generally calculated in perturbative QCD, in which the cc pair may be produced in a color singlet or color octet state (Braaten and Fleming, 1995; Cho and Leibovich, 1996a). The latter part, which describes the evolution of the cc pair with the quantum numbers of the final charmonium state, cannot be calculated in perturbation theory, and the relevant parameters are usually extracted from the data. A signature of the NRQCD approach is the universality of the long distance production matrix elements, which are assumed to be independent of the hard process of parton production. For a more extensive account of EFTs and quarkonia, see Section 18.1.4. Before presenting the experimental results it is worth emphasizing that the B Factories provide the cleanest processes for calculation of charmonium production, as ccpairs in B decays (Section 18.2.4.1) and e+ eâ annihilation (Section 18.2.4.2) are produced via weak and electromagnetic processes, which can be calculated exactly. However in some cases, the test of such predictions requires a careful treatment of the details of the experimental measurements (Section 18.2.4.3)."

It lays out a personal vision of the kind of science I would really want to see in the future and why this new vision of science would be an improvement over what we now have. The paper itself is an attempt to share that vision, without getting bogged down in speculation about how the vision might be achieved or impediments to itâs achievement. Hopefully, the ideas presented here will generate a dialogue culminating in a shared vision of the future of science that can motivate movement in the direction of the vision."
360,281,0.286,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"This experiment checked compatibility for the 36 predicate concept pairs that were used in sentences of Experiment 1. I aimed to measure the typicality of one particular event as an instance of the concepts P1 and P2, namely one in which both predicates P1 and P2 apply simultaneously (event E). As already discussed at length earlier on in this paper, I conducted an indirect textual test in which I assess the typicality of event E for P1 and P2 by measuring the predicatesâ compatibility. This test was identical to the pretest, but carried out by different subjects and now containing fewer items, in a fully controlled experiment. Participants The same 33 students from Utrecht University from Experiment 1 participated in this experiment. Each subject completed the interpretation experiment ï¬rst, before proceeding with the typicality experiment. Also, in between experiments they took part in a third, unrelated experiment. Materials The materials consisted of a questionnaire containing 36 statements about one person involved in two actions simultaneously. Half of the statements were about males and half of them were about females (matching the gender of persons in the pictures of Experiment 1). Each statement contained a singular object (a male or a female) and two conjoined predicates (e.g. The man is sitting and reading). The 36 pairs of verbs were the same as the ones used in sentences of Experiment 1, thus one third of the pairs were considered compatible in the second pretest (e.g. sitting and reading), one third were considered incompatible (e.g. sitting and standing), and one third were considered atypical (e.g. sitting and cooking). The order of items was pseudo-randomized using Mix software (Van Casteren and Davis 2006), with the restriction that at most two items of the same type (in terms of compatible/incompatible/atypical) immediately followed each other. Finally, four different orders of the questionnaire were constructed: two versions that started with the statements about males (with the second one having reversed order within males and females statements), and two versions that started with the statements about females (with the second one having reversed order within males and females statements).

249,233,0.285,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"The fundamental opposition between realism and anti-realism concerns therefore, according to Dummett, the key notion of the theory of meaning, i.e. the notion in terms of which the meaning of the statements of the given class is to be explained: truth according to the realist, evidence according to the anti-realist. However, since Dummett holds that meaning is to be explained in any case in terms of truth-conditions, and that for the anti-realist truth can consist only in the existence of evidence, the realism/anti-realism opposition, in the final version he offers, concerns the notion of truth to be used in explaining meaning: the bivalent notion according to the realist, some non-bivalent notion according to the anti-realist.6 The criterion of realism is therefore, in Dummettâs opinion, the acceptance/refusal of the bivalence principle concerning truth. Notice that this raises immediately a question: if we are ready to oppose the realistic, bivalent, notion of truth with other, non-bivalent, notions, we must ask at which conditions a notion can be considered as a notion of truth. I shall return to this question later. For the time being let me observe that the story of the semantic characterization of the realism/anti-realism debate is not finished. After Dummett it has been observed that all the anti-realistic notions of truth on the market (truth as assertibility, truth as existence of a verification, and so on) share a general characteristic: that truth is an epistemic notion, and therefore is essentially knowable. Knowability has therefore been identified as the essential property of truth, and anti-realism has been characterized as the view that every truth is knowable. It is precisely this feature of anti-realistic truth that the paradox is intended to hit. In this paper I shall first argue that an intuitionistic solution to the paradox is available; then I shall examine the position of neo-verificationism concerning the paradox; finally I shall briefly consider the general question of how a rational discussion of alternative logics is possible at all."

We should âbe much more direct about what it is that [we] mean to sayâ. Neuroscientists and experimentalists would, in fact, warm to âa list of facts or statements separated by periods with the occasional transition term to hold it all togetherâ; at the moment, it was hard to â[extract] the message out of what seemed like an artistically-written piece that made use of many unconventional phrases and secondary definitions of otherwise common wordsâ. The second reviewer came from quite a different angle â arguing that there was âsomething peculiarly paradoxical in [the paperâs] very conceptâ. We, the authors, were trying to set ourselves up as âexperimentally, experientially, and intellectually outside of the âblack boxâ â, but in actual fact, we were held captive by âthe tools of cognitive neuroscience, i.e., on a scientific apparatusâ. No matter the âdepth and authenticity of the joint collaborative exerciseâ for which we were advocating, we were pinioned by the inescapability and irreducibility of the scientific laboratory. For this reviewer, the point of âthis âfourth wayâ of neuro-engagementâ was far from clear. For the scientist, the rhetorical style in which the âartistically-writtenâ paper was written obviated the chance that its arguments would be received by those coming from different, scientific, traditions of research writing. For the second reviewer, whom we assume to be a social scientist or humanities scholar, it conceded far too much to the sciences. This is a fairly consistent refrain. And yet, in general the two of us, as well as many of our collaborators, have been quite successful at publishing significantly interdisciplinary papers in relatively high impact journals â a success that we attribute at least in part to such papers having a certain currency among editorial board members at some journals. We do not want to prejudge whether this enthusiasm is necessarily shared by the editorial board members of many mainstream neuroscience journals. And for the collaborating neuroscientist, being published in a high impact social science journal, which may have both a relatively long time from submission to date of publication, and a relatively low âimpact factorâ compared to even mid-ranking journals in some biological and medical fields, might represent poor return for her labour. (Letâs note at this point that while the 2014 impact factor of the leading journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience was 31.427, that of Social Science & Medicine (a very highly regarded social science journal) was 2.890.)

An important consistency check for the overall shape of F (k) is to give a reasonable description of the measured shape of the photon-energy spectrum in inclusive B â Xs Î³ decays (see Section 17.9), which at leading order in 1/mb is given in terms of the same function F (k) via an expression analogous to Eq. (17.1.62). In addition to the leading shape function F (k), several additional shape functions appear at O(ÎQCD /mb ) (Bauer, Luke, and Mannel, 2003). Apart from their ï¬rst few moments, very little is known about the form of these subleading shape functions. They thus introduce an uncertainty in the theoretical predictions that is hard to quantify in a systematic fashion. An even larger number of unknown shape functions appears at O(Î±S ÎQCD /mb ) (Lee and Stewart, 2005). Weak annihilation contributions could have a large impact at large q 2 and might be another source of theoretical uncertainties. However, recent analyses (Bigi, Mannel, Turczyk, and Uraltsev, 2010; Gambino and Kamenik, 2010; Ligeti, Luke, and Manohar, 2010) have used CLEOc data to constrain contributions from weak annihilation, resulting in a rather small impact. The corresponding uncertainty is below 2% for the total rate, translating into an uncertainty of less than 1% on |Vub | for the most inclusive analyses. For the determination of |Vub | theoretical predictions by diï¬erent groups are in use. A more detailed summary and comparison can be found elsewhere (Antonelli et al., 2010a). At their core, the diï¬erent calculations are all based on Eq. (17.1.62), but they diï¬er in the treatment of the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. The BLNP approach (Bosch, Lange, Neubert, and Paz, 2004; Lange, Neubert, and Paz, 2005) preferentially treats the kinematic region p+ X âª pX where the pX and pX dependences of C factorize. This allows for the resummation of Sudakov double logarithms of p+ X /pX and pX /mB to NNLL. They also include the full O(Î±S ) corrections, for which the perturbative expansions are performed using the so-called shape-function scheme for mb , and a subset of the perturbative corrections in C are absorbed into F (k). The subleading shape functions are separately modeled and included in the predictions. The GGOU approach (Gambino, Giordano, Ossola, and Uraltsev, 2007) treats the p+ X âª pX and pX â¼ pX regions on the same footing. The coeï¬cient C is computed at ï¬xed order to O(Î±S ) and O(Î±S2 Î²0 ) (Gambino, Gardi, and Ridolï¬, 2006), where the perturbative expansion is performed using the kinetic scheme for mb . In this case no resummation eï¬ects at small p+ X are included. The eï¬ect of resummation as well as all contributions from subleading shape functions are absorbed into F (k). This results in three non-universal distribution functions Fi (k, q 2 ), which have subleading dependence on q 2 . In the dressed-gluon exponentiation (DGE) approach (Andersen and Gardi, 2006; Gardi, 2008) the perturbative expansion includes the NNLL resummation in moment space as well as the full O(Î±S ) and O(Î±S2 Î²0 ) corrections. It also incorporates an internal resummation of running coupling corrections in the Sudakov exponent. This"

Events are required to contain exactly four good charged tracks. Two of the tracks must be identified as same-flavor, opposite-charge leptons. The pion candidates are taken to be the remaining two tracks and must fail an electron requirement. Radiative Bhabha events, a background to this event topology, are rejected by requiring that the electron satisfy a laboratory polar angle requirement, cos(Î¸) < 0.8.

To reject this background, the opening angle between the pions must satisfy cos Î¸Ï+ Ïâ < 0.95 if mÏ+ Ïâ < 0.050 GeV/c2 ; for any dipion mass, the angle between the dipion system and either of the leptons must satisfy cos Î¸Ï+ Ïâ ,âÂ± < 0.98. The events are also required to contain at least two photons, with minimum energy requirements (one with CM energy > 0.070 GeV and the other with CM energy > 0.060 GeV) consistent with the typical energies expected from the transition photons. Final-state radiation photons are rejected by requiring that cos Î¸Î³,â < 0.98. If there is more than one photon pair combination that satisfies these requirements, the pair whose energies minimize a Ï2 constructed from the measured and expected photon energies is chosen as the best pair. The Î¥ (1 3DJ ) candidate is combined with the photon pair to form the Î¥ (3S) candidate, whose momentum must be < 0.3 GeV/c. The Î¥ (3S) candidate mass is then constrained to the nominal mass value. An extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit is then performed on the mass of the Ï + Ï â â+ ââ system (Fig. 18.4.11).

311,1813,0.281,The Physics of the B Factories,"18.4.1 Introduction At the advent of the B-factory experiments, measurements of the spectrum of the bottomonium system were limited to only a few states â the Î¥ (nS) and Ïb (nP ) resonances. However, the theoretical predictions for this spectrum were abundant and the bottomonium system oï¬ered open territory for scientific exploration. The spectrum of the bottomonium system is illustrated in Fig. 18.4.1. Of particular interest were the bottomonium ground state, the Î·b (1S), and its excitations (the S-wave singlet states, e.g. Î·b (2S)), the discovery of the hb (nP ) P -wave singlet states, measurements of their properties and of transitions between bottomonium states as tests of various theoretical frameworks (Lattice QCD, NRQCD, pNRQCD, QCD potential models, etc.). In addition, these measurements allowed for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (such as violation of universal couplings to leptons, dark matter, and low-mass Higgs bosons). The bottomonium programs at BABAR and Belle yielded a rich assortment of both discoveries and measurements. The ground state of the bottomonium system was first discovered by BABAR and later confirmed by Belle, yielding multiple independent mass and branching fraction measurements (Section 18.4.4.2). In addition, Belle discovered the Î·b (2S) and measured its mass. The BABAR Collaboration was the first to show evidence of the existence of the P -wave singlet state, hb (1P ), and the Belle Collaboration demonstrated clear discovery of this state and also of its partner, the hb (2P ) (Section 18.4.4.3). Discovery of these states required in parallel the measurement of transitions between states, and these are detailed in the aforementioned sections. Independent measurements (unconnected with searches for new resonances) of transitions between bottomonium states, as well as decays to hadronic final states, are detailed in Section 18.4.6. The bottomonium system yielded many surprises, however, when compared to the expectations from theoretical predictions. The Belle confirmation of the Î·b (1S) and discoveries of the Î·b (2S) and hb (1P, 2P ) were all made possible in part by apparently large and anomalous Ï + Ï â transition rates from the Î¥ (5S) resonance. This is discussed in Section 18.4.4.3. In addition, as a result of their investigations of these anomalous transition rates, two new states were discovered by the Belle Collaboration just above the open-bottom threshold (Fig. 18.4.1) - the charged Zb states (Section 18.4.5)."

If we look back at the birth of the modern computer in the 1950s, nobody could have predicted how much computers would change society and how dependent we would become on them. There are well-known quotes from computer pioneers proclaiming that the world would only need a handful of computers and that nobody would ever need a computer in their home. These quotes are out of context. The authors were generally referring to specific types of computers, but the impression they give, though exaggerated, is true. Initially computers were massive, had to be in air-conditioned rooms, and were not very reliable. Today, I have a laptop, a smartphone, and a tablet. All three are far more powerful than the first computers. I think that even visionaries like Alan Turing would be amazed at the extent to which computers have thoroughly permeated all levels of society. Turing did discuss chess playing and artificial intelligence, but nobody predicted that the rise of e-commerce and social media would come to dominate so much of our lives. Quantum computing is now in its infancy, and the comparison to the first computers seems apt. The machines that have been constructed so far tend to be large and not very powerful, and they often involve superconductors that need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures. Already there are some people saying that there will be no need for many quantum computers to be built and that their impact on society will be minimal. But, in my opinion, these views are extremely shortsighted. Although it is impossible to predict what the world will be like in fifty years time, we can look at the dramatic changes in quantum computing over the last few years and see the direction in which it is heading.

The big questions are about the nature and the properties of the Higgs particle(s). The search for the Higgs boson and for possible new physics that could accompany it was the main goal of the LHC from the start. On the Higgs the LHC should answer the following questions: do some Higgs particles exist? And if so, which ones: a single doublet, more doublets, additional singlets? SM Higgs or SUSY Higgses? Fundamental or composite (of fermions, of WW, or other)? Pseudo-Goldstone bosons of an enlarged symmetry? A manifestation of large extra dimensions (fifth component of a gauge boson, an effect of orbifolding or of boundary conditions, or other)?

The VCS trigger selects events in which the detected electron plus photon system has a small transverse momentum and the recoil mass close to zero. For most of e+ eâ â e+ eâ Ï 0 events, the close photons from Ï 0 decay cannot be separated by the trigger cluster algorithm and are identified as a single photon. Therefore, the VCS trigger has relatively large eï¬ciency for events of the process under study (50â80%, depending on the Ï 0 energy). The second feature is the large QED background. The main background source is VCS. There is also a sizable background from the e+ eâ â e+ eâ Î³Î³ process in which one of the final electrons is soft and one of the photons is emitted along the beam axis. The photon from the QED process, together with a soft photon (from beam background, for example) may give the invariant mass close to the Ï 0 mass. Special selection criteria described in detail in Aubert (2009y) are applied to suppress QED background. After QED background suppression, the signal events are selected by the requirements that there are electron and Ï 0 candidates in an event with energies above 2.0 and 1.5 GeV, respectively, and that the electron plus Ï 0 system has a small transverse momentum and a recoil mass close to zero. To avoid systematic uncertainty due to possible data-simulation diï¬erences in detector response near the detector edges, the e+ eâ â e+ eâ Ï 0 cross section is measured in the region Q2 > 4 GeV2 , where the detection eï¬ciency for signal events is greater than 5%. The Q2 region from 4 to 40 GeV2 is divided into 17 intervals. For each interval, the number of signal events is determined from the fit to the two-photon invariant mass spectrum with a sum of a Ï 0 resolution function and a polynomial background distribution. For Q2 > 40 GeV2 , no evidence of a signal over background is found in the two-photon invariant mass distribution. The total number of events with a Ï 0 in the Q2 range 4â40 GeV2 is about 14000. Some events containing a Ï 0 may arise from background processes such as e+ eâ annihilation, vector-meson bremsstrahlung e+ eâ â e+ eâ V , and two-photon processes with higher multiplicity final states such as e+ eâ â e+ eâ Ï 0 Ï 0 . The e+ eâ annihilation background is estimated using the diï¬erence in the distributions of the eÂ± Ï 0 momentum z-component for signal and background. In twophoton events with a tagged positron (electron), the momentum z-component is negative (positive), while annihilation events are produced symmetrically. The annihilation background is assumed to be equal to the number events with the wrong sign of the eÂ± Ï 0 momentum zcomponent and is found to be negligible. The largest bremsstrahlung background is expected to arise from the process e+ eâ â e+ eâ Ï with Ï decaying to Ï 0 Î³. The background is estimated from the number of data events with an extra photon, in which the invariant mass of the Ï 0 Î³ system is close to the Ï mass. This background is also found to be negligible."

Using quantum computers to study chemistry that belongs to the quantum world is a natural idea that has great potential. There are a number of areas where it is hoped that quantum computing will make important contributions. One of these is to understand how an enzyme, nitrogenase, used to make fertilizers actually works. The current method of producing fertilizers releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases and consumes considerable energy. Quantum computers could play a major role in understanding this and other catalytic reactions. There is a group at the University of Chicago that is looking into photosynthesis. The transfer of sunlight to chemical energy is a process that happens quickly and very efficiently. It is a quantum mechanical process. The long-term goal is to understand this process and then use it in photovoltaic cells. Superconductivity and magnetism are quantum mechanical phenomena. Quantum computers may help us understand them better. One goal is to develop superconductors that donât need to be cooled to near absolute zero. The actual construction of quantum computers is in its infancy, but even with a few qubits it is possible to begin studying chemistry. IBM recently simulated the molecule beryllium hydride (BeH2) on a seven-qubit quantum processor. This is a relatively small molecule with just three atoms. The simulation does not use the approximations that are used in the classical computational approach. However, since IBMâs processor uses just a few qubits, it is possible to simulate the quantum processor using a classical computer. Consequently, everything that can be done on this quantum processor can be done classically. However, as processors incorporate more qubits we get to the point where it is no longer possible to simulate them classically. We will soon be entering a new era when quantum simulations are beyond the power of any classical computer. Now that we have seen some of the possible applications, we will briefly survey some of the ways that are being used to build quantum computers. Hardware To actually make practical quantum computers you need to solve a number of problems, the most serious being decoherenceâthe problem of your"

Such an idea presupposes some means of defining the universe of items. The resistance to the idea was most vocally expressed by Jane Loevinger (1965), who could not envision how to explicate such universes. Nevertheless, the relevance of sampling in validation was affirmed by Cronbach (1980) and Kane (1982), although not as a sufficient consideration, even though the link back to Tryon was lost along the way. What appears to have been missed in Tryonâs argument is that he intended the universe of items to be isomorphic with a âuniverse of factors, causes, or components determining individual differencesâ (p. 433), which would imply a crossing of content and process in the creation of a universe of items. Such an idea foreshadows notions of validity that would be proposed many decades later, specifically notions related to construct representation (Embretson 1983). Instead, in time, the sampling perspective became synonymous with content validity (Cronbach 1971): âWhether the operations that finally constitute the test correspond to the specified universe is the question of content validityâ (p. 452, emphasis added). The idea of a universe was taken seriously by Cronbach (although using for illustration an example from social psychology, which, interestingly, implies a constructed-response test design): For observation of sociability, the universe specification presumably will define a category of âsocial actsâ to be tallied and a list of situations in which observations are to be made. Each observation ought to have validity as a sample from this universe. (p. 452)"

If we know the branching fraction of the mesonâs decay mode used in the measurement, then we can extract the two-photon decay width; otherwise, we measure the product of the twophoton decay width and the branching fraction. The twophoton partial decay width is a fundamental and direct observable to explore the qq or exotic nature of the neutral meson. Even for a non-exotic meson, the two-photon decay width is useful to study the quarksâ quantum state inside the meson and to test QCD models (Munz, 1996). In a zero-tag measurement, we can make the signal events almost free from other processes by applying a rather stringent transverse-momentum balance. This is a great advantage in searches for new resonances as well as new decay modes of known hadrons. The requirement for the transverse-momentum balance also restricts the Q2 of"

This is actually surprising, because we still canât overcome the old difficulties.

If CP T symmetry is broken, then one or more of these conditions must be violated. In particle physics, Lorentz violation is usually studied in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. This theory and its application to B mixing is briefly reviewed in Section 17.5.5.1.

Second, as we will see, there are direct conceptual parallels between his ideas and many of the more mathematically rigorous modern ideas. Third, Hayekâs work in theoretical psychology is underappreciated, especially given both its breadth and depth. We will see that Hayekâs work provides a conceptual framework that suggests overlap between a number of modern theoretical ideas and AAA (Fig. 8d). With regards to AAA, the main point here is the connection between computation at the single cell level (e.g., as discussed, coincidence-detection, association) and more network-level implications. This link is what Hayek explores. Hayekâs foundational idea is quite straightforward. He posited three orders: (1) the external world (which he called the physical order), (2) the brain (which he called the sensory order), and (3) the mind (which he called the phenomenal order), and he focused his efforts on understanding the relationship between the three. In Hayekâs formulation, the state of the brain has an isomorphic correspondence with that of the mind. The structure of the psychological realm, for Hayek, was relational (e.g., psychological objects are defined relative to other psychological objects), and as such, that structure of relationships that make up the psyche had to be recapitulated in the structure of the neural network and its activity. This strict correspondence contrasts with the correspondence between the outside world and the structure of the brain (and thus the mind), which is imperfect, as shown by the existence of sensory illusions. The problem for Hayek was then to describe how the relational network that is the psyche can be encoded in the structure and activity of a neural network, given the computational properties of single neurons that make up that network. Although this might seem trivial to todayâs standards, it cannot be overstated how important this development was, especially given prevailing ideas at the time. In the end, we will see that Hayekâs solution comes in a form that is in many ways remarkably similar (though missing the details of biophysics and anatomy that remained uncovered until the 1990s) to the ideas of AAA, Integrated Information theory, and Predictive Coding and discuss their connections. For Hayek the main questions were: 1. How can a relational network be encoded in the structure and activity of a neural network?10 2. How are the relations between objects in the outside world learned and encoded (imperfectly) in the neural network of the brain11?"

In their eye-movement experiment, strongly preferred coercion sentences (The teenager began the novelâ¦) did not differ from weakly preferred ones (The waitress started the coffeeâ¦). This suggests that the coercion cost is not modulated by the preference of interpretation or the number of different interpretations. In fact, both the strongly and weakly preferred sentences in their experiment involve aspectual verbs and animate subjects. Under the SI hypothesis, both sentences give rise to an ambiguity along different dimensions (e.g. informational, temporal, or eventive), and therefore cost emerges independent of the preference, as it is observed."

The most important data to emerge are those produced through the coming together of the human experimental subject(s) and the scanner; these should be published in a neuroscientific journal (though ancillary publications that address other disciplinesâ concerns are of course welcomed). In short: what emerges here is a spatial imaginary centred on the model of a multi- (rather than inter-) disciplinary mix, a mix that will establish, it is hoped, a methodological and conceptual âlayer cakeâ. (We are employing here the usual distinction between the multi-disciplinary, in which disciplines line up alongside one another, from the interdisciplinary, which usually carries some commitment towards creating emergent, and novel forms of knowledge different from those contained within any one discipline.) Within this layer cake, each disciplinary layer has dominion over a particular kind of expertise, particular methods, and particular objects of knowledge. You can see this play out in numerous published interdisciplinary books and studies that address the mind and brain (see e.g. Goldman 2006; Slaby and Gallagher 2015). Joseph Dumit, we should note, has provided a powerful analysis of how cognitive psychology was brought into contact with PET to produce the interdisciplinary layer cake that became the foundation of the interdisciplinary field of cognitive neuroscience (Dumit 2004). We should not be unduly surprised, therefore, that the layer cake functions as the buttressing logic for other interdisciplinary endeavours involving the brain and mind. There are a few examples that depart from the layer cake genre. Roepstorff and Frith, for example, in elaborating a model of experimental anthropology âas a method, as an object of study and as a research aestheticâ, argue that joint engagement (doing things together) in research projects across the disciplines leads to the need for researchers of all stripes then to âbe sensitive both to the type of facts and the types of contexts produced by going experimentalâ (Roepstorff and Frith 2012,"

Finally, the pragmatic perspective argues that while people search for truth, they can never truly find it. Thus, what the community of inquiry deems is truth is merely the current best opinion and is itself only temporary (Haskel, 1984; Seixas, 1993). This perspective has implications for entrepreneurship. Namely, research on opportunities has often taken the view that opportunities are discovered or created and that creation dominates discovery in certain contexts and vice versa in other contexts (Alvarez & Barney, 2007). An interaction perspective of opportunity, however, provides an alternative path for future studies (consistent with Deweyâs [1939] characterization of mindâworld dualism). Under this perspective, potential opportunities do not belong exclusively to the domain of the mind or of the world; rather, they involve the inter-relationship (i.e., mutual adjustment) of both. Indeed, as Gergen (1994, p. 129) pointed out, a vexing problem can arise when there is division and isolation between the mind and the world: âWhen a real world is to be reflected by a mental world and the only means of determining the match is via the mental world, the real world will always remain opaque and the relationship between the two inexplicable.â Scholars can make future contributions to our understanding of opportunity by viewing potential opportunities as a conceivable means to think about and discuss the world that proves useful (through action) while simultaneously recognizing that opportunities are only tentatively held and are subject to modification as they enter and re-enter the environment. Research Opportunities from a More Interactive Perspective of Entrepreneurial Opportunity Community contributions to potential opportunity refinement. Following this line of thinking (i.e., viewing opportunity detection and refinement in an interactive manner), the notion of a potential opportunity should not only be considered as part of the initial creatorâs mind but also grounded in a community.

213,141,0.267,Collider Physics Within The Standard Model : a Primer,"2.7.2 The Final State in eC e Annihilation Experiments on eC e annihilation at high energy provide a remarkable opportunity for systematically testing the distinct signatures predicted by QCD for the structure of the final state averaged over a large number of events. Typical of asymptotic freedom is the hierarchy of configurations emerging as a consequence of the smallness of Ës .Q2 /. When all corrections of order Ës .Q2 / are neglected, one recovers the naive parton model prediction for the final state: almost collinear events with two back-to-back jets with limited transverse momentum and an angular distribution 1 C cos2  with respect to the beam axis (typical of spin 1/2 parton quarks, while scalar quarks would lead to a sin2  distribution). To order Ës .Q2 /, a tail of events is predicted to appear with large transverse momentum pT  Q=2 with respect to a suitably defined jet axis (for example, the thrust axis, see below). This small fraction of events with large pT consists mainly of three-jet events with almost planar topology. The skeleton of a three-jet event, to leading order in Ës .Q2 /, is formed by three hard partons qNqg, the third being a gluon emitted by a quark or antiquark line. To order Ës2 .Q2 /, a hard perturbative non-planar component starts to build up, and a small fraction of four-jet events qNqgg or qNqqNq appear, and so on. Event shape variables defined from the set of 4-momenta of final state particles are introduced to describe the topological structure of the final state energy flow in a quantitative manner [154]. The best known event shape variable is thrust (T) [192], defined as i jpi  nT j (2.78) T D max P i jpi j where the maximization is in terms of the axis defined by the unit vector nT : the thrust axis is the axis that maximizes the sum of the absolute values of the longitudinal momenta of the final state particles. The thrust T varies between 1/2, for a spherical event, to 1 for a collinear (2-jet) event. Event shape variables are important for QCD tests and measurements of Ës , and also for more practical purposes, like a laboratory for assessing the reliability of event simulation programmes and a tool for the separation of signals and background."

360,286,0.266,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"5 Discussion This paper reports on an experimental investigation into the interpretation of plural sentences with predicate conjunction, and its connection to typicality. I proposed that the extent to which non-intersective interpretations are available directly correlates with the atypicality of an event in which the two predicates apply simultaneously. Experiment 1 revealed a continuum of acceptability values of 36 sentences in a non-intersective, âsplitâ situation, ranging from 24% to 100% acceptable. Such a continuum is unexpected under the extended SMH by Winter (2001), which assumes that any given sentence is either true or false in a particular situation, depending on what the context allows. Next, Experiment 2 showed that differences in compatibility exist between different predicate pairs. The compatibility ratings for 36 pairs ranged over the entire 6-point scale. I assumed that the compatiblity measurement is an indirect measurement of typicality, namely of the typicality of event E (in which two predicates apply simultaneously) for each predicate concept in isolation, and hence that this effect is similar to the effects that were found repeatedly for one-place predicates (e.g. Rosch 1973). I proposed to extend the Maximal Typicality Hypothesis (Kerem et al. 2009; Poortman et al. 2017) by formulating it for predicate conjunction in such a way that typicality relates to acceptability so that the less compatible the two predicates in Experiment 2 are judged to be (i.e. the less typical event E is), the more a non-intersective interpretation is available. Based on a correlation analysis, I conclude that this prediction was borne out. Note that this correlation does not hinge on my assumption that compatibility is an indirect way of measuring typicality. I merely"

For instance, if a radioactive atom decays, then its doing so is not the result of a prior sufficient physical condition. Instead, its decay is an irreducibly probabilistic process about which the most that can be said is that the atomâs decay was something very likely to occur within a certain interval of time. At no time, however, was its decay physically determined to occur. So too, on certain views about freedom of will, in some cases agents act or choose freely, and according I am grateful to participants at the, âWhat is Really Possible?â Workshop, University of Utrecht, June, 2012, for their comments on an earlier draft of this chapter.

249,143,0.264,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"6 Conclusions and Further Work In this paper we have argued for two central claims: (1) that the apparent consensus that the Kreisel-Goodman paradox is engendered by the adoption of Kreiselâs second clause interpretations of â, Â¬ and â is mistaken; and (2) that the ability of a formal system to internalize reasoning about its own proofs plays a larger role in the paradox than is customarily acknowledged. Taken in conjunction, these observations point towards the possibility of responding to the paradox by developing a system which retains as many of the features of the unstratified theory T + as possible while seeking a conceptually motivated means of limiting the scope of the internalization principle The evident question is what form such a delimitation might take. Taken together with the observations we have recorded about the role of free variables and reflection principles in the paradox, one obvious proposal would be to consider subsystems of formalisms similar to QLP in which the scope of Lift is limited by the exclusion of quantifier or substitution rules akin to Eug. Although such a proposal may be justifiable in terms of Kreisel and Goodmanâs original foundational goals, a variety of questions remain open: (i) is a consistency proof similar to that described by Goodman [16] available for an appropriate subsystem of T + ? (ii) is it possible to prove the soundness and completeness of HPC in the sense of Val for such a system? (iii) are the second clause interpretations of the intuitionistic connectives required for such a result? (iv) is it possible to formulate a version of Goodmanâs interpretation of Heyting arithmetic relative to the relevant system? Needless to say, these questions will have to wait for another occasion."

The role of conservation laws has been dealt with in the literature (see references in Chapter 25 [2]). None of these explicit attacks killed the leading exponential part of the mass spectrum. It remains, as an illustration of the resistance of .m/, to assume that, for whatever reason, every mass once added to it, has to be eliminated again. (I do not know of any serious argument which would require this. The Levinson theorem derived in non-relativistic potential scattering [80] cannot be invoked in a situation where all kinds of reactions between constituents take placeâbut assume it had to be so.)

275,345,0.264,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In this experiment, the participants consistently rated option (b) as more probable than (a). However, according to the axioms of probability theory, the conjunction of events is less probable than a single event, so (b) must be less probable than (a). This type of judgement errors has been found so invariably that it became known as the conjunction fallacy (see [31, 34] for other such fallacies). These findings are not widely known, let alone implemented, by programmers designing the communication part of autonomous systems. The latter systems so far adhere to the laws of probability and logic, which is their strength. Their weakness, however, is to not account for how humans make decisions. For example, an intelligent system that would correctly answer (a) in the experiment above, might bewilder the human who was expecting answer (b). In turn this could erode that humanâs trust in such a system. Let us take another, more concrete, example from technology soon to become reality. Suppose you arrive late in the evening at a meeting. As the street is clearly indicated as a tow zone, you let your self-driving car find a parking space elsewhere to park in your stead. Later you come back and find that it parked in the first free spot in that same street. Would this not be the time to reconsider your trust in the autonomy of the car? And so you instruct it not to do this again. But then it politely explains [24] that the tow zone only applies during rush hour, thus restoring your trust. An even better scenario would be that when you leave the car to park itself, it would tell you that yes, this is a tow zone, but only during rush hour. Machines have become smart enough to do the first part, in this case finding a parking space and park. But then, is it not time to work on the second part, where the machine proactively explains its actions from the humanâs point of view? Or the part where it can foresee a human error because it knows how a human would reason in a particular case? This stands to hugely help humans put trust in autonomous systems, and in the current presentation we show a direction one could go. To elaborate the problem we want to address, before trying to solve it, consider Wittgensteinâs often cited remark âIf a lion could talk, we could not understand himâ ([37], p. 223). The remark has been food for much thought and speculation (that it is probably true) for half a century, notably in the philosophy of language. We wonder, however, that if we cannot even understand a lion, whence the confidence that we will understand machines when it comes to communicating with them verbally? Here we think that Wittgensteinâs own, less quoted, comment can lead the way [37]: If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgements. This seems to abolish logic, but does not do so â It is one thing to describe methods of measurement, and another to state results of measurement. (p. 391, our italics)"

232,423,0.263,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"Injunction is a communication triggering action as the addressee should adapt his behavior regarding its message (conformity). This communication comes from an authority and is both binding and relying on its addressee subjectivity [5]; as the addressee is linked to the expected action or to its aim regarding responsibility criterion. Fundamentally, injunction implies a tension between what comes from oneself (autonomy) and what is implemented by external sources (heteronomy) [6]. This phenomenon affects oneâs identity as no one can predict how far a subject will integrate external things to his subjectivity [7] and experience. By saying so, one would conclude right by stating that safety injunction is not always or completely deï¬ned in time, space and form as shown by its legal evolutions from British Equity system to its 19th to early 20th variations in the United States of America (Stewart 1895; Gregory 1898; Mc Murry 1961) cristalized in the Pullman strikes repression through the Omnibus Indictment, and to its actual uses demonstrating that the term âinjunctionâ has no ï¬xed deï¬nition but is determined by its practice (Preston 2012, p. 5). That is why, prevention posters from Oak Ridge Laboratory dating from the Manhattan Project times are still quite relevant for any worker exposed to radiation sources, even though some military elements might have lost some sense since [8]. What is also interesting about injunction as a management device is that there is a wider array of potential issuers than in the order case. So far, three kinds of authorities have been identiï¬ed as relevant to make an injunction. The ï¬rst authority observed is derived from the recognized power one has to direct someone else, such as in hierarchy case. This typical authority has been widely analyzed since management studies beginning, particularly with Henri Fayol description of administrative skills use [9]."
311,1781,0.262,The Physics of the B Factories,"this would imply an n = 3 hyperfine splitting of (98 Â± 8) MeV/c2 , almost twice as large as the n = 2 splitting of (47 Â± 1) MeV/c2 . The BABAR study of the Y (3915) state favors a 0++ quantum number assignment, for which the closest charmonium level is the 2 3P0 state, the so-called Ïâ²c0 . In this case, its 2 3P2 multiplet partner is likely the Z(3930) with a measured mass of (3927Â±3) MeV/c2 , implying an anomalously small 3P2 -3P0 fine splitting of only â 10 MeV/c2 for the n = 2 triplet P -wave multiplet (an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding n = 1 splitting). Moreover, the Ïâ²c0 is expected to have a partial decay width to DD of order 30 MeV/c2 (Barnes et al., 2005), which, by itself, is substantially wider than the measured total width of the Y (3915). Even though no experimental limits on B(Y (3915) â DD) have been reported to date, no signs of a signal for Y (3915) â DD are evident in the measured DD invariant mass distributions for B â DDK decays published by BABAR (Aubert, 2008bd) or Belle (Brodzicka, 2008), even though both studies see prominent signals for B â Ï(3770)K, Ï(3770) â DD.

213,224,0.262,Collider Physics Within The Standard Model : a Primer,"2.10.4 Other Ës .mZ / Measurements as QCD Tests There are a number of other determinations of Ës that are important because they arise from qualitatively different observables and methods. Here I will give a few examples of the most interesting measurements. A classic set of measurements comes from a number of infrared-safe observables related to event rates and jet shapes in eC e annihilation. One important feature of these measurements is that they can be repeated at different energies in the same detector, like the JADE detector in the energy range of PETRA (most of the intermediate energy points in the right-hand panel of Fig. 2.32 are from this class of measurements) or the LEP detectors from LEP1 to LEP2 energies. As a result, one obtains a striking direct confirmation of the running of the coupling according to the renormalization group prediction. The perturbative part is known at NNLO [213], and resummations of leading logs arising from the vicinity of cuts and/or boundaries have been performed in many cases using effective field theory methods. The main problem with these measurements is the possibly large impact of non-perturbative hadronization effects on the result, and therefore on the theoretical error. According to [99], a summarizing result that takes into account the central values and the spread from the JADE measurements at PETRA, in the range 14â46 GeV, is Ës .mZ / D 0:1172 Ë 0:0051 ; while from the ALEPH data at LEP, in the range 90â206 GeV, the reported value [164] is Ës .mZ / D 0:1224 Ë 0:0039 :"
82,206,0.262,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"3.7 Barbara Bacterium In this chapter we have introduced the concept of a probabilistic regress, that is an epistemic chain of the form q ââ A1 ââ A2 ââ A3 ââ A4 . . . where the arrow is interpreted in terms of probabilistic support. We examined Lewisâs view that such a regress is absurd, since it allegedly implies that the probability of q is zero. According to Lewis, the only way to avoid the absurdity was to stop at a proposition, p, which is certain: q ââ A1 ââ A2 ââ A3 ââ A4 . . . ââ p. We have opposed Lewisâs argument by giving counterexamples, i.e. probabilistic regresses which yield a unique, nonzero probability value for the target. Some of these regresses were based on uniform conditional probabilities, others on nonuniform ones. All our counterexamples were abstract. This is somewhat unfortunate, since a familiar objection to infinite regresses is that they are not concrete and lack practical relevance. The objection becomes even more pressing if one distinguishes (as we did not do here but will do in later chapters) between propositions and beliefs. Propositions are abstract entities, but beliefs are propositional attitudes that people really have.

Thirteen native speakers of Dutch provided picture-word match decisions in yes-no format under a 5-s time limit, and the response times were measured as well. The judgments were generally consistent with our expectation: For our Main stimuli, we observed around 95% âYesâ responses to all three shades (Levels 3, 6, and 9) of our test categories (258 out of 273 trials, with 1 timed-out trial and 14 âNoâ responses), conï¬rming that our color manipulation in our stimulus images did not affect their noun category membershipâblack bears are just as good as brown and black-brown ambiguous ones for the category bear, and for Fillers, accuracy was high at 86%.

If two statutes on the level of the same legislative authority were incompatible, it is âthe nature and reason of thingâ253 that decides for the preference of the more recent.

A perceived advantage of the stit treatment of action is that we are not forced to say exactly what action is performed by a when the vase is moved or left where it is.

They are computed by some deterministic function, and if you know the function and the initial seed input, you can calculate exactly the same string. There are no classical computer algorithms that generate truly random strings. Thus, already we can see that quantum computations have some advantages over classical ones. Before we start to describe other quantum computations we need to develop a precise mathematical model that describes what happens when we measure spin in various directions. This is started in the next chapter where we study linear algebraâthe study of the algebra associated with vectors."

Since the B decays are dominated by the b â c transitions, and the e+ eâ â cc cross section is comparatively high, the B factories also generated plenty of charm which allowed detailed measurements with highly competitive precision. FCNC processes of up-type quarks are predicted to be heavily GIM suppressed, which motivated measurements and searches of rare and even forbidden decays of charm at the B factories. Although for many FCNC processes it is diï¬cult to make a precise theoretical prediction, the B factories added a lot of new information on these decays, constraining significantly the limits on physics beyond the Aside from the weak interactions also many studies of QCD related issues have been performed. The charm quark is neither heavy enough to be cleanly treated within"
360,292,0.258,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"Despite the fact that we can safely rule out reference shift as an alternative explanation of the results, obviously there are many other factors that are worth further exploration. The correlation that was found in this study was high (r = 0.66, n = 36, p < 0.001), though obviously not perfect. This means that there must be more factors that affect interpretation besides the one tested here. An important next step is to delve deeper into typicality effects for complex predicates. In the current chapter, I report an experiment that indirectly measured one particular typicality measurement with one particular dependent measure, namely the typicality of two simultaneous actions, rated on a scale. One can imagine that in fact the typicality of the opposite event, i.e. two predicates applying to two separate individuals, or perhaps sequentially to one individual, might also affect the interpretation of a plural sentence with those predicates. Moreover, as pointed out by a reviewer, perhaps not only the verb concepts but also the head noun of the sentences play a role. It might be that the compatibility of two predicates is quite different in the context of humans than it is for example in the context of dogs: people can run and scratch their heads simultaneously, but dogs cannot. In order to fully understand the factors that influence sentence interpretation, an intricate combination of typicality measures is necessary. Also, it will be good to correlate rating measures with different kinds of dependent measures such as categorizaton speed or error rate to have a more robust resultâsimilar to the investigations into typicality effects for nouns. However, the fact that even one measure can distinguish different types of verb pairs so clearly, is a promising starting point for this enterprise. Another related issue is the deeper question of how typicality effects come about: What exactly makes a particular instance of a concept typical? A potential candidate factor is that typicality is formed by prior experiences or likelihood of a situation. An anonymous reviewer, however, pointed out example (16). (16) The boys are unicycling and juggling The reviewer claims that despite the fact that we probably rarely see a person simultaneously unicycling and juggling, we still probably interpret the conjunction in sentence (16) intersectively (though of course a full sample of participants would need to be consulted to be sure). Such an example points out that typicality is not simply a matter of frequency, but a far more complex notion that needs to be studied further. The question of what makes something typical does not affect the results described in this chapter per se, but knowing what affects typicality would give them more explanatory power, as pointed out by this reviewer."
26,36,0.258,Cognitive Supervision for Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Laser Surgery,"filament of a light bulb emitting yellow light (Î½ = 5 Ã 1014 Hz, see Fig. 2.2) at a temperature of T = 2000 K, then Eq. 2.1 yields that Psp /Pst â 1.5 Ã 105 . This example is indicative of how the emission of visible traditional light sources consists predominantly of spontaneous emission. Conversely, stimulated emission strongly prevails at long wavelengths, e.g. in the far infrared and microwave ranges. To have significant stimulated emission at wavelengths shorter than far infrared, it is necessary that a particular condition is met, referred to as population inversion [2]. This entails altering the distribution of the atomic energy levels in a medium, so that more atoms reside in higher energy states than in the lower. A population inversion can be artificially created pumping energy into the medium, either by means of a traditional powerful light source (optical pumping) or establishing a current flow into it (electrical pumping) [2]. The basic working principle of a laser device is illustrated in Fig. 2.3. A laser system is typically composed of two main parts: (i) a cavity filled with an active medium and (ii) a pump source that injects energy into the medium, thus creating a population inversion that triggers the stimulated emission of light. The cavity is enclosed by two reflective optical elements which force the light to travel back and forth through the medium. Further stimulated emission is produced at each pass, resulting in an optical amplification effect. Once the system has built up a sufficient amount of energy, a fractional part of the light trapped in the cavity escapes through one the reflecting mirrors; this is designed in such a way to have non vanishing transmission at the laser characteristic frequency. The light that escapes the cavity forms the output beam of the laser. Several different materials can be employed as active medium: these include solids, gases, fluids, semiconductors; the choice of the medium determines the wavelength at which stimulated emission occurs."

311,599,0.256,The Physics of the B Factories,"In addition to the combinatoric backgrounds, there exist fully or partially reconstructed backgrounds that originate from decays of the same class of parent meson to a ï¬nal state similar to the one under consideration. For example, in an analysis of the decay B 0 â KS0 Ï + Ï â there are potentially large backgrounds from many other B decays including B 0 â Î· â² (â Ï0 Î³)KS0 , B 0 â Dâ (â KS0 Ï â )K + , and B + â KS0 Ï + . In the ï¬rst of these examples the decay has been partially reconstructed but the energy of the missing photon is suï¬ciently small that the reconstructed B 0 candidate passes selection criteria. In the second case the decay is fully reconstructed but a kaon/pion misidentiï¬cation occurs. In the third case the decay is again fully reconstructed and combined with an additional soft pion from the rest of the event to form a signal candidate. Each of these scenarios can lead to very diï¬erent distributions of events in the Dalitz plot. In general, the distributions of backgrounds across the Dalitz plot are rather diï¬cult to model with parametric functions. Additionally, the precise nature of the backgrounds can vary dramatically from one analysis to another. Thus, the most common approach for modeling the Dalitz-plot distributions of the backgrounds is to use histograms obtained from either Monte Carlo simulation or sidebands in data. Often some form of smoothing or interpolation is applied to the histograms in order to limit the eï¬ect of statistical ï¬uctuations in the input data sample. In B decay analyses, it is found that most backgrounds (particularly the dominant combinatoric backgrounds) preferentially populate the corners and edges of the Dalitz plot. In order to increase the resolution of the histograms in these regions, adaptive binning techniques can be used and/or the histograms can be formed in the so-called âsquare Dalitz plotâ, which is discussed in detail in Section 13.4.1. 13.3.2 Efficiency The most obvious eï¬ect of detector acceptance is a reduction in the number of events detected. In three-body decays this is complicated by the fact that the kinematic properties of the decay products diï¬er accross the Dalitz plot. Thus, the acceptance as a function of the Dalitz plot variables is, in general, nonuniform. The typical acceptance function drops at the corners of the phase space, which correspond to the kinematic conï¬guration where one of the ï¬nal state particles is produced at rest in the frame of the decaying particle. Reconstruction eï¬ciency is typically smaller for such particles, especially if the decaying particle has a small boost in the laboratory frame. At BABAR and Belle, the eï¬ciency proï¬le is usually well modeled by the full detector simulation. The proï¬le is then modeled either by a parameterized form, such as a two-dimensional polynomial, or by a histogram. Either way, this allows the eï¬ciency as a function of the position in phase space, Îµ (m), to be included in the signal Dalitzplot model, where it multiplies the squared absolute value of the amplitude. When histograms are used they often"

After looking at algorithms, we switch gears and briefly look at how quantum computation can be used to simulate quantum processes. Chemistry, at its most basic level, is quantum mechanical. Classical computational chemistry works by taking quantum mechanical equations and simulating them using classical computers. These simulations are approximations and ignore the fine details. This works well in many cases, but in some cases it doesnât. In these cases you need the fine details, and quantum computers should be able to give them. This chapter also briefly looks at building actual machines. This is a very fast-growing area. The first machines are being offered for sale. There is even one machine available on the cloud that everyone can use for free. It looks likely that we will soon enter the age of quantum supremacy. (We explain what this means.) The book concludes with the realization that quantum computation is not a new type of computation but is the discovery of the true nature of computation."
305,176,0.256,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"The inability to clone a qubit has many important consequences. We want to be able to back up files and send copies of files to other people. Copying is ubiquitous. Our everyday computers are based on von Neumann architecture, which is heavily based on the ability to copy. When we run a program we are always copying bits from one place to another. In quantum computing this is not possible for general qubits. So, if programmable quantum computers are designed they will not be based on our current architecture. At first, the fact that we cannot clone qubits seems like a serious drawback, but there are a couple of important comments that need to be made. Often we want to prevent copying. We want to secure our dataâwe donât want our communications to be tapped. Here, as we saw with Eve, the fact that we cannot clone qubits can be used to our advantage, preventing unwanted copies from being made. The second comment is so important it deserves its own section. Quantum Computation versus Classical Computation The qubits 0 and 1 correspond to the bits 0 and 1. If we run our quantum CNOT gate just using the qubits 0 and 1 , and not any superpositions, then the computation is exactly the same as running a classical CNOT gate with 0 and 1. The same is true of the quantum version of the Fredkin gate. Since the classical Fredkin gate is universal and the quantum Fredkin gate using just 0 and 1 is equivalent to the classical gate, we can see that a quantum circuit can calculate anything that can be calculated by a classical circuit. The no-cloning property may seem worrisome, but it doesnât restrict us from doing classical computations in any way. This is a deep result. It shows that if we compare classical and quantum computation, we shouldnât think of them as different types of computation. Quantum computation includes all of classical computation. It is the more general form of computation. The qubit is the basic unit of computation, not the bit. Now that we have seen some basic gates, we will start to connect them together to form circuits."

249,103,0.256,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"Although Dummett provides no further explanation for this change of heart, his reaction echoes that of other theorists who, in the intervening years, had come to conclude that the Theory of Constructions not only did not live up to Kreiselâs promise of providing a âsemantical foundationâ for intuitionistic logic, but was also ill-motivated because of its association with the second clause. As we are now in a good position to appreciate, however, the formulation of a theory such as T is independent of how (or even if) we elect to attempt to use its object language to formalize the BHK clauses. And as such, it seems that criticisms of the Theory of Constructions which are grounded in objections to the propriety of adopting the second clause are likely to be off base. Putting this observation to the side for the moment, it is also possible to identify two broad classes of criticisms which have been targeted at the second clause itself. The first of these is that the transition from (e.g.) (Pâ ) to (P2â ) either adds nothing to the original BHK interpretation or does not serve to resolve the problems which appear to have motivated Kreisel to introduce it. For instance, Girard [12] says the following: Since the â and â cases were problematic (from [the . . .] foundational point of view), it has been proposed to add to (Pâ ) [. . . ] the codicil âtogether with a proof that f has this propertyâ. Of course that settles nothing, and the Byzantine discussions about the meaning which would have to be given to this codicilâdiscussions without the least mathematical contentâonly serve to discredit an idea which, we repeat, is one of the cornerstones in Logic [12, p. 7]."

The âgolden sphere of harmonyâ had already ceased to exist long ago and even the basic convictions (the philosophemes) of classical physics became untenable. Indeed, quantum physics exemplifies the âshakiness of our metaphysicsâ (p. 151), but also the âawareness of the need for synthesisâ. But this, according to Bloch and his followers, would require a shift, on the level of the philosophemes (beneath the bar: S1), towards dialectic materialism as the new foundation, turning society as such into a kind of university world, with physicists as guardians of the atomic age. According to Marxism, only a classless society may solve the crisis that science (S2 above the bar) experiences today (p. 151), abolishing philosophy by absorbing it into science.

But due to this discovery, Cantor (apparently an impassive researcher) suddenly becomes a craving subject, driven by the desire to establish priority and secure the prize (p. 61). In terms of university discourse: the confrontation with arginineâs role in tumorigenesis (a in the upper-right position), destabilises the expert (S2 in the upper-left position) and produces various symptoms of desire ($ in the lower-right position) in a seemingly impassive university professor. For Stafford, Cantor is a lab creature (S2), but it soon turns out that he is not a single-minded researcher who lives solely for his work. He has a second, secret life (and an affluent one at that, because of a calculated marriage). Outside the lab, he lives the life of a gentleman-connoisseur, interested in erotic art, classical music and Jugendstil furniture, playing Boccherini in a string quartet and obsessed with SchÃ¶nberg, Hindemith and Egon Schiele. In this role, he encounters Paula Curry, a tall, athletic, cello-playing Valkyrie who happens to be Celestineâs aunt. Clouds begin to appear in the clear blue sky when Cantor receives a call from his competitor Kurt Krauss (professor at Harvard) informing him that, although he had put his best post-doc (Yuzo Ohashi, âmy Staffordâ) to work on it, the latter had been unable to replicate Jerryâs experiment. Cantor decides that Jerry and he should replicate the experiment together, and apparently this time they are successful, until Cantor receives an anonymous note, an unsigned message, one sentence long, suggesting that Jerry secretly doctored the results: Why was Dr. Stafford in your private laboratory Sunday evening? (p. 93). This of course raises Cantorâs suspicion. Why had Jerry secretly visited the lab? Cantor faces a dilemma. Should he retract the paper, exposing himself to academic humiliation, so that from now on every colleague will associate his name with fraud, or at least with sloppiness and irreproducibility? Cantor had never withdrawn a published paper before, had never reported unduplicatable experiments. An error of this magnitude would never be forgotten. Cantor decides to perform a second experiment, using a somewhat different design, an alternative route to the top. With the Prize before him and the spectre of withdrawal peering over his shoulder, he disappears into his private lab for weeks, unavailable to the outside world. In the end, all seems to end well. Both versions of the experiment are eventually confirmed, and both Cantor and Stafford fly to Stockholm to collect the Nobel Prize, but this does not put an end to the questionability of their results and the situation remains uncomfortable. The dialectical structure of the narrative can be summarised as follows. The first moment (M1) is an unexpected idea which allows Cantor to link abstract biochemistry with something relevant and concrete, namely cancer research. But this idea has to be realised in an experimental fashion (M2), and this proves a frustrating experience, because the researchers are confronted with a hurdle, with the replication complex as it were. The goal is to overcome this hurdle, to discover the decisive experimental move, so that the abstract idea can be sublated into textbook knowledge (M3), but on the final page of the novel it is still unclear whether this has really been achieved. Djerassi, the author, is an organic chemist himself, famous for his contribution to the development of the oral birth control pill. Besides that, he authored several"
227,17,0.253,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Hence, the fruitless efforts of the initiation phase are only seemingly so. They not only set up the aforementioned tension responsible for the emotional release at the time of illumination, but also create the conditions necessary for the process to enter into the incubation phase. Illumination is the manifestation of a bridging that occurs between the unconscious mind and the conscious mind (PoincarÃ© 1952), a coming to (conscious) mind of an idea or solution. What brings the idea forward to consciousness is unclear, however. There are theories of the aesthetic qualities of the idea, effective surprise/shock of recognition, fluency of processing, or breaking functional ï¬xedness. For reasons of brevity I will only expand on the ï¬rst of these. PoincarÃ© proposed that ideas that were stimulated during initiation remained stimulated during incubation. However, freed from the constraints of conscious thought and deliberate calculation, these ideas would begin to come together in rapid and random unions so that âtheir mutual impacts may produce new combinationsâ (PoincarÃ© 1952). These new combinations, or ideas, would then be evaluated for viability using an aesthetic sieve, which allows through to the conscious mind only the âright combinationsâ (PoincarÃ© 1952). It is important to note, however, that good or aesthetic does not necessarily mean correct. Correctness is evaluated during the veriï¬cation stage. The purpose of veriï¬cation is not only to check for correctness. It is also a method by which the solver re-engages with the problem at the level of details. That is, during the unconscious work the problem is engaged with at the level of ideas and concepts. During veriï¬cation the solver can examine these ideas in closer details. PoincarÃ© succinctly describes both of these purposes. As for the calculations, themselves, they must be made in the second period of conscious work, that which follows the inspiration, that in which one veriï¬es the results of this inspiration and deduces their consequences.

363,165,0.251,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"This depiction of photography as magical is present in some of the earliest reviews of the medium. Thus, one English reviewer, writing for The Athenaeum in 1839, called its effects âperfectly magicalâ (qtd. in McQuire, 1998: 13). Mary Warner Marien argues that in the earliest stories of photographyâs origins the technology that made the science of photography possible is couched in mythical, magical language, making of photography a mysterious and hybrid form. She gives the example of stories about Louis Daguerre in which accident, or fate, becomes a character. Daguerre receives a vision of the camera obscura during a dream and a spoon in his cupboard is darkened by mercury fumes overnight. These serendipitous accidents, or fateful events, become as important to Daguerreâs role in the invention of photography as his technological successes engendered by hard work and scientific knowledge and experimentation. Such stories, suggests Marien, âpitch mystery, magic, and alchemy against banal technological accounts of photographyâs adventâ (Marien, 1997: 54).5 Green-Lewis calls this ârealismâs romance with photographyâ, and suggests that in a culture dominated by realism and the desire to reveal, the depiction of photography as magical allowed it to be romanced as the ultimate in proof, as unbiased truth (Green-Lewis, 1996: 9â10).6 It is the photographâs association with perfect representation that, for Linda Hutcheon, makes it attractive to historiographic metafiction. In The Politics of Postmodernism (1989) she links fiction and photography since âboth forms have traditionally been assumed to be transparent media which paradoxically could master/capture/fix the realâ. She argues that in historiographic metafiction photographic models become metaphors for âthe related issue of narrative representation â its powers and its limitationsâ, particularly for the telling of history (Hutcheon, 1989: 39). However, this focus upon the cameraâs perceived capacity for representational veracity elides the other capacity for which photography was enthusiastically welcomed and celebrated in the nineteenth century. The magic attributed to photography also allowed it to be romanced as a memorial. Barrett-Browningâs celebration of the photograph as âthe very shadow of the person lying there fixed foreverâ is echoed in the late twentieth century by Susan Sontag, for whom the photograph is âsomething directly stenciled off the real, like a footprint or a death mask â¦ never less than the registering of an emanationâ. More than realist representation, here the photograph contains the âtraceâ of its subject, is a âmaterial vestigeâ (Sontag 1977: 154). More than correspondence, the photograph inheres its subject. As Green-Lewis"

However, they do not have the power to annul or invalidate these decisions: âThe courts and tribunals only apply the general, provincial and local decisions and rulings to the extent that they conform to the lawâ.188 These articles do not refer to the question of the conformity of the law to the Constitution but they do make clear that the judicial power is not entitled to interfere in the spheres of action of the legislative and executive powers. It has been supposed by analogy that tribunals do not have the competence of judicial review.189 This is a logical outcome of the importance attached to the separation of powers in the Belgian Constitution.190 Judicial review would contradict Art. 26 which states that the legislative power is exercised by the Chambers and the King collectively. This is a classical argument against the establishment of Constitutional Courts (cf. debates on the American Supreme Court). In the Belgian context the lawgiver is protected against interference of the judiciary. Given that Parliament cannot be forced to respect the Constitution, it has unrestricted legislative power.191 In other words, it has the power to make unconstitutional law. However, the Congress clearly expected future parliaments to act in accordance with the Constitution. The Congressmen believed that the respect of succeeding assemblies for the Constitution would be too great to ever allow the introduction of unconstitutional laws.192 In addition, the oath for members of Parliament on the Constitution, as well as part 2 of Art. 25 (âAll the powers"

In practice, a single transmitter and receiver pair can operate with a bandwidth of 10â20 GHz for transmission distances of some tens of kilometers. Optical amplifiers, which most commonly operate at wavelengths near 1550 nm, can be used to increase the range of transmission. In the modulation process, the power of the carrier is varied in proportion to the voltage of the signal. Because of this, the effect of small unwanted components in fiber transmission systems is greatly reduced. Consider, for example, a small component of the optical signal resulting from a reflection within the fiber. If the optical power of the reflected component is x dB less than that of the main component, then after demodulation at the photodetector, the signal power contributed by the reflected component is 2x dB less than that from the main optical component. This also applies to small unwanted effects resulting from finite isolation of couplers, isolators, and other elements. Variations in the frequency response resulting from standing waves in microwave transmission lines are significantly less in optical fiber than in cable. A feature that must be taken into account in applications of optical fiber is the dispersion in velocity, D, usually specified in ps.nm # km/!1 . The difference in the time of propagation for two optical wavelengths that differ by ""$ traveling a distance ` in the fiber is D""$`. Figure 7.3 shows the dispersion for two types of fiber. Curve 1 is for a type of fiber widely used in early applications, and curve 2 represents a design in which the zero-dispersion wavelength is shifted to coincide approximately with the minimum-attenuation wavelength of 1550 nm. This optimization of the performance at 1550 nm is achieved by designing the fiber so that the dispersion of the cylindrical waveguide formed by the core of the fiber cancels the intrinsic dispersion of the glass at that wavelength. Consider a spectral component, at frequency !m , of a broadband signal that is modulated onto an optical carrier. Amplitude modulation of the signal results in sidebands spaced Ë!m in frequency with respect to the carrier. Because of the velocity dispersion, the two sidebands and the carrier each propagate down the fiber with slightly different velocities and thus exhibit relative offsets in time at the receiving end. Such time offsets result in attenuation of the amplitude of the high-frequency components of analog signals and in broadening of the pulses used to represent digital data. Thus, for both analog and digital transmission, dispersion Fig. 7.3 Dispersion D in single-mode optical fiber of two different designs, as a function of the optical wavelength."

Additional photons can be present as long as their individual energies are less than that of the signal photon and their total energy in the laboratory frame does not exceed 0.14 GeV. A multilayer perceptron neural network is then used to combine kinematic variables from the dipion system into a single discriminant that can reject background. The neural network is trained on data taken at a collider CM energy below the Î¥ (2S) resonance, and on signal MC simulation. In the low-mass region, this approach retains 87% of simulated signal events while rejecting 96% of events from non-Î¥ (2S) (continuum) events. In the high-mass region, this approach retains 73% of signal while rejecting 98% of continuum background. In addition to backgrounds from sources other than the Î¥ (2S), there could be backgrounds from real Î¥ (1S) radiative decays where the final-state products are diï¬cult to detect reliably.

To reject these backgrounds, events are rejected where there is activity in the BABAR instrumented flux return within a 20â¦ window opposite the reconstructed signal photon.

249,225,0.249,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"5 Concluding Remarks: From Semantic Dualism to Duality Let us finally address further potential implications of categorical logic to the theory of meaning. The dualism between the referentialist and inferentialist conceptions of meaning may be called the semantic dualism. Categorical logic may (hopefully) yield a new insight into the semantic dualism, as argued in the following. From a categorical point of view, âdualityâ may be discriminated from âdualismâ. Dualism is a sort of dichotomy between two concepts. Duality goes beyond dualism, showing that the two concepts involved are actually two sides of the same coin, just as two categories turn out to be equivalent by taking the mirror image of each other in the theory of categorical dualities. Duality in this general sense seems to witness universal features of category theory. Indeed, the classic dualism between geometry and algebra breaks down in category theory. For example, the categorical concept of algebras of monads encompasses topological spaces in addition to algebraic structures. Category theory may be algebraic at first sight (indeed, categories are many-sorted algebras), yet it is now used to formulate geometric concepts in broad fields of geometry, ranging from algebraic and arithmetic geometry to knot theory and low-dimensional topology. It is also a vital method in representation theory and mathematical physics. Technically, there are a great number of categorical dualities between algebraic and geometric structures (e.g., the Gelfand duality and the Stone duality). It may thus be said that the concept of categories somehow captures both algebraic and geometric facets of mathematics at a deeper level, and so there is duality, rather than dualism, between algebra and geometry. Just as in this sense category theory questions the dualism between algebra and geometry, categorical logic opaques the generally received, orthodox distinction between model theory and proof theory, and presumably even the semantic dualism above, suggesting that they are merely instances of the one concept of categorical logic. For example, the Tarski semantics and the Kripke semantics, which are two major instances of set-theoretic semantics, amount to interpreting logic in the"

Itâs an interesting fantasy, but in reality Samuel Morse had understood the concept of this device early on. The device weâve invented is called a repeater, or a relay. A relay is like a sounder in that an incoming current is used to power an electromagnet that pulls down a metal lever. The lever, however, is used as part of a switch connecting a battery to an outgoing wire. In this way, a weak incoming current is âamplifiedâ to make a stronger outgoing current. Drawn rather schematically, the relay looks like this:"
95,281,0.248,Elements of Robotics,"8.4.2 Uncertainty in Sensing The values returned by the robotâs sensors reflect the intensity of the light reflected by the gray colors of the doors and walls. If the difference in the color of a dark gray door and a light gray wall is not very great, the robot may occasionally detect a dark gray door as a light gray wall, or conversely. This can occur due to changes in the ambient lighting or to errors in the sensors themselves. It follows that the robot cannot distinguish between the two with complete certainty. We model this aspect of the world by assigning probabilities to the detection. If the robot senses dark gray, we specify that the probability is 0.9 that it has correctly detected a door and 0.1 that it has mistakenly detected a wall where there was in fact a door. Conversely, if it senses light gray, the probability is 0.9 that it has correctly detected a wall and 0.1 that it has mistakenly detected a door where there was a wall."

Because epistemological justification is about giving reasons, and not about making calculations, the finite mind objection applies in full force. A similar reaction to our views has been voiced by Adam Poslaskowski and Joshua Smith.15 They argue that, although âvaluable lessonsâ can be drawn from our formal results, it is âentirely unclearâ that these results meet a basic requirement, namely âproviding an account of infinite chains of propositions qua reasons made available to agentsâ.16 Podlaskowski and Smith call this âthe availability problemâ: Given the distinctive emphasis that Peijnenburg, Atkinson, and Herzberg place on calculability, we have doubts about the extent to which (on their account) an infinite chain of propositions can serve as reasons that are available to an agent. (This is what shall be called the availability problem facing the distinctive brand of infinitism under consideration).17 . . . it is hard to see, more generally, how the emphasis on calculability yields a notion of available reason (or availability) that can serve the infinitistâs purposes.18"

249,324,0.248,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"Abstract In this paper we discuss a proof-theoretic foundation of set theory that focusses on set definitions in an open type free framework. The idea to make Cantorâs informal definition of the notion of a set more precise by saying that any given property defines a set seems to be in conflict with ordinary modes of reasoning. There is to some extent a confusion here between extensional perspectives (sets as collections of objects) and intensional perspectives (set theoretic definitions) that the central paradoxes build on. The solutions offered by Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories, von Neumann-Bernays set-class theories and type theories follow the strategy of retirement behind more or less safe boundaries. What if we revisit the original idea without making strong assumptions on closure properties of the theoretical notion of a set? That is, take the basic definitions for what they are without confusing the borders between intensional and extensional perspectives.

There is no real randomness in classical mechanics, just what is often called sensitive dependence to initial conditionsâa small change in the input can get amplified and produce an entirely different outcome. The underlying idea concerning randomness in quantum mechanics is different. The randomness is true randomness. The sequence NSSNNNSS â¦ that we obtained from measuring spin in two directions is considered to be truly random, as we shall see. The sequence of coin tosses, HTTHHHTT â¦ appears random, but the classical laws of physics are deterministic and this apparent randomness would disappear if we could make our measurements with infinite accuracy. At this stage it is natural to question this. Einstein certainly did not like this interpretation, famously saying that God does not play dice. Couldnât there be a deeper theory? If we knew more information about the initial configurations of our electrons, couldnât it be the case that the final results would no longer be random but completely determined? Couldnât there be hidden variablesâonce we know the values of these variables, the apparent randomness disappears? In what follows we will present the mathematical theory in which true randomness is used. Later we will return to these questions. We will describe a clever experiment to distinguish between the hidden variable and the true randomness hypotheses. This experiment has been performed several times. The outcomes have always shown that the randomness is real and that there is no simple hidden variable theory that can eliminate it. We started this chapter by saying that a qubit can be represented by the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon. We will show how the models for spin and polarization are related. Photons and Polarization It is often said that we are not aware of the strange quantum phenomena because they only occur at incredibly small scales and are not apparent at the scales of our everyday life. There is some truth to this, but there is an experiment that is completely analogous to measuring spin of electrons that can be performed with very little apparatus. It concerns polarized light."

249,58,0.246,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"Abstract The goal of this paper is to consider the prospects for developing a consistent variant of the Theory of Constructions originally proposed by Georg Kreisel and Nicolas Goodman in light of two developments which have been traditionally associated with the theoryâi.e. Kreiselâs second clause interpretation of the intuitionistic connectives, and an antinomy about constructive provability sometimes referred to as the Kreisel-Goodman paradox. After discussing the formulation of the theory itself, we then discuss how it can be used to formalize the BHK interpretation in light of concerns about the impredicativity of intuitionistic implication and Kreiselâs proposed amendments to overcome this. We next reconstruct Goodmanâs presentation of a paradox pertaining to a ânaiveâ variant of the theory and discuss the influence this had on its subsequent reception. We conclude by considering various means of responding to this result. Contrary to the received view that the second clause interpretation itself contributes to the paradox, we argue that the inconsistency arises in virtue of an interaction between reflection and internalization principles similar to those employed in Artemovâs Logic of Proofs.

78,149,0.246,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"as can be seen in numerous sources, these distinctions squarely rest on a Cartesian dualismâone that radically divorces a non-cognitive body (and with it, the whole of nature as âextended substanceâ) from a non-extended and thereby fully disembodied mind. As but one example: Katherine Hayles (1999, p. 288) discerned this dualism at work in the foundational discipline of cybernetics as developed by Norbert Wiener (1950). More broadly, this dualism reiterates ancient Gnostic and Greek dualisms that in turn root the Western Orthodox teaching of Original Sinâwhose Augustinian language is in fact explicitly invoked in one of the key documents of early conceptions of cyberspace, namely, William Gibsonâs Neuromancerâthe science-fiction novel that propelled the term âcyberspaceâ into popular culture and academic discourse (Ess 2012b, pp. 5â7). Correlative notions of a disembodied âliberation in cyberspaceâ appealed both to âcyber-libertariansâ such as John Perry Barlow (1996) as well as to some feminists and others rightly interested in overcoming the objectification and correlative subordination and violation of women (and others). Other feminists, however, early on raised warnings against the âold Cartesian trickâ of seeking to forget the body (Stone 1991). Finally, by the end of the 1990s, this dualism was increasingly refuted along a range of research and reflection, including the work of Katherine Hayles, as well as that of Pierre LÃ©vy (1998). At the same time, the Cartesian-inspired epistemological models underlying much of the work in Artificial Intelligence in the latter half of the twentieth centuryâcrudely, lumped under the name of cognitivismâwere likewise receding in the face of emerging evidence in the neurosciences that highlighted the inextricable interactions between the various mechanisms and processes of âthe bodyâ and those traditionally affiliated with consciousness and awareness. These newer, radically non-dualistic views are captured under notions of âembedded mind,â âembedded cognition,â and âenactivismâ (e.g., Horst 2011)."

360,430,0.246,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"Indeed, the purpose of using a combined concept rather than just the category is usually to refer to a subcategory that is distinct from other members of the category (e.g., Clark and Berman 1987; Downing 1977). This accounts for why previous research (e.g., Connolly et al.2007, 2011; GagnÃ© and Spalding2014b; Hampton et al. 2011) has found that a property (e.g., has webbed feet) that is true of an unmodiï¬ed concept (e.g., duck) also is seen as being true of a modiï¬ed concept (e.g., baby duck) but less so. This explanation readily accounts for why a property (e.g., has teeth) that is false of an unmodiï¬ed concept (e.g., candle) is judged as being more true of a modiï¬ed concept (e.g., purple candle), as reported in a series of experiments reported by (Spalding and GagnÃ© 2015). Both results (for the true and the false properties) can be explained by participants reasoning that the subcategory is distinct in some way from the category. Interestingly, the reasoning process appears to be more heavily dependent on meta-cognition and on pragmatic factors than on the speciï¬c content of the concepts involved. Consequently, content-free modiï¬ers (i.e., unknown words) also produced a modiï¬cation effect even though they had no content that could be used to assess speciï¬c similarity or dissimilarity with the category. Finally, Spalding and GagnÃ© (2015) argue that if property veriï¬cation for combined concepts involves such predication following reasoning and judgment, it is possible that such processes are also involved in all property judgments for single concepts, not just combined concepts. This, in turn, suggests a very different, more Aristotelian-Thomistic, approach to the relation between property and concept, rather than the kind of implicit âcontainerâ metaphor that is so common in current theories of concepts. In particular, in the A-T approach, concepts are not âmade ofâ properties and they do not âcontainâ properties, and so one does not verify properties by âlooking insideâ the concept. We return to this point in the Discussion."

After the explosion the doubts and concerns of individuals (as divided subjects) aggravated, transforming them into security risks. Leaking classified information became a singular form of âmisconductâ, closely connected with the bomb project. Whereas normal science depends on the free exchange of information, certain forms of information were suddenly labelled as highly confidential. In a dramatically changed political landscape, the physicists experienced a split (Spaltung) between their scientific vocation and their political obligations. In other words, the splitting of the atom (a) corresponded with a splitting of the scientific subject (S2 â $). Oppenheimer was not a purely detached, objective, impassive, replaceable, etc. researcher, but rather fuelled by a basic truth, which surfaced on July 16, 1945, when, by citing his Hindu quote, he articulated, in a very condensed way, his spiritual understanding of the eternal cycle of creation, preservation and destruction (S1 in the lower-left position). The subsequent appropriation of the atomic bomb by the State (depriving the collectivised scientific workers, who had been put to work at the Los Alamos kolkhoz, of their surplus value, their object a) resulted, in Lacanian terms, in a temporary resurgence of the discourse of the Master. By taking possession of the bomb, in order to ascertain a position of nuclear monopoly, the U.S. President basically claimed âWorld order, câest moiâ (S1 now in the upper-left position as agent). The world from now on revolved around the bomb and the position of the U.S. President was from now on defined by and closely associated with the bomb. During the Truman Administration, sensitivity to ethical qualms concerning the legitimacy of the development and use of genocidal weapons ($) was pushed beneath the bar ($ now in the lower-left position), as the U.S. presidency aimed to use its nuclear monopoly to establish global political supremacy, a position of power relying on the bomb, pushing scientists back into the position of scientific workers: recipients of instructions from those in power (S2 in the upper-right position), in accordance with the dynamics of the Masterâs discourse:"

From a Lacanian-Bachtinian perspective, it is clear that the âweâ functions as a grammatical operationalisation of S2: the replaceable, un-subjective, decidedly impersonal subject of science. But it also covers up the exploitation and expropriation of the servant by the Master (âWe, the Master, did thisâ). And Leahâs therapeutic intervention proves effective, for from now on, Stafford begins to pay attention to Cantorâs use of the term âweâ (or âourâ), which suddenly may give way to âIâ or âmineâ. For instance, he now notices that Cantor informs him that the Krauss team is having troubles repeating âyourâ experiment, and that there may be something the matter with âyourâ notebooks, while he consistently speaks about âourâ Nature article. In the latter case, there is âno ambiguity about ourâ (p. 89). In other words, Cantor uses the âweâ in such a way that he may safeguard his intellectual property rights, while attributing any experimental flaws to his assistant. From now on, Stafford begins to pay attention to (and even count) Cantorâs uses of the signifier âweâ (p. 83). Indeed, the use of the signifier âweâ proves highly symptomatic and, from the point of view of critical discourse analysis, a fascinating object of research. In response to Leahâs intervention, Celestineâs supervisor makes a telling confession. At a certain point in her career, she decided to change her name from Yardley to Ardley, in view of the importance of alphabetic order in the listing of author names: Let me confess something to you â¦ but promise not to spread it around â¦ When I was a senior at Brown [University] â and a very ambitious one, almost unpleasantly so â I paid very much attention to where my name would ultimately appearâ¦ To my fatherâs shock, I announced one day that I would change my name from Jean Yardly to Jean Ardleyâ¦ Yes. I went to the courthouse and did it legally. Itâs best to be first, itâs been true since prehistoric times (p. 51)."
192,411,0.244,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"and eventually derailing experience, namely that social psychology (as an established paradigm) is unable to reach the level of specificity needed to comprehend everyday existence the way novels, plays and movies do. The contradiction resurges between the specificity of fiction and the generality of academic research (M2). In order to reconcile the two, established social psychology must be sublated (in the Hegelian sense of the term Aufheben) by combining the experimental method with the âspecificity principleâ, so that social psychology becomes sensitive to the complexities, nuances and idiosyncrasies of everyday life. It would also entail a reconciliation of social psychology with the genres of the imagination practiced by Stapel during the pre-academic stage of his career. In other words the specificity principles aims to achieve a negation of the negation, a convergence of the quest for general cognitive mechanism (social psychology) with a radical openness to the transient theatre of everyday existence, bringing social psychology on a higher level of complexity (M3). But unfortunately, this third moment proves unreachable (M2 â | M3) so that his project of transforming (sublating) the paradigm falters. The reconciliation of social psychological theory and everyday phenomena proves unattainable. More precisely, Stapel is unable to overcome the tension between reality as a littered, messy, disorderly environment and the mapping techniques of social psychology. He keeps looking for the causal factor x which allows us to address a problem by pushing a button, but this presupposes that the world is as makeable and modifiable as the behaviour of test animals in research facilities. While aiming to develop a level of specificity comparable to novelists or playwrights, Stapel continues to turn research subjects into lab rats in a labyrinth. But the human world proves too recalcitrant and transient to be captured in Stapelâs mousetraps. This leads to discontent and stagnation ($). The publication factory falters. This crisis precedes his misconduct. Fabrication and falsification are desperate efforts of a craving subject to remain faithful to the logic of the established paradigm, so that the infringement could be seen as a desperate act of fidelity, committed in response to the fact that the social psychological fact-fabricating factory as such is faltering. But social psychology fails to realise a cleansing of reality, so that it is ironical that the normative trinity eventually calls for a âcleansing operationâ to clean up the Stapelgate mess. Could journal articles such as Stapelâs Science paper (a fingered, fabricated story) be regarded as a piece of fiction, a Zola-like, literary experiment? This interpretation is negated by the decidedly dichotomous or even stereotypical style of thinking of Stapelâs paper (clean versus littered environments, prejudiced versus non-prejudiced subjects, etc.), while novelists and playwrights tend to depict a greyer and more ambiguous ambiance.

192,259,0.244,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In a self-reflective mood, during a conversation with Paula Curry, Cantor confesses that scientific research is not as straightforward as is sometimes suggested. Most scientists suffer from what he refers to as a âdissociative personalityâ (p. 113). On the one side, they are rigorous believers in the experimental method with its set of rules, bent on advancing knowledge (in other words: S2). On the other hand, they remain fallible human beings with all the accompanying emotional foibles (in other words: $). One of the gravest occupational hazards in science, moreover, is simultaneous discovery. Sooner or later, somebody else will have the same idea. Scientists are driven by one desire: recognition by their peers (the Krausses of this world), but in order to obtain recognition, priority is essential. To score a Nobel Prize, one has to be the first to reach the summit. Thus, the push for priority is enormous. And the only way to establish priority is to be the first to publish. In other words, due to the confrontation with arginine (the object a), the self-contained expert (S2) falls victim to disruptive desire, and this results in a split (Spaltung) between adherence to methodological safeguards (S2) and the desire to maintain his advantage, his momentum, so that Cantorâs eagerness to score ($) suddenly seems to overrule his impeccable technique. Krauss is Cantorâs scientific conscience or superego. If the experiment proves impossible to replicate, Krauss may accuse him of sloppiness, or even fabrication: âSurely he is not calling you a â. Paula stopped shortâ, p. 109). And once someoneâs credibility in science is damaged, it can never be repaired. The only option left to Cantor is to do the experiment himself, to become his own Servant as it were, and to design a second experimental test, climbing Everest by a different route (p. 116). Because he cannot trust Stafford anymore (p. 113), he has to take the experiment literally in his own hands, doffing his costume for a lab coat. It is only via working through that the methodological requirements and desire for recognition can be reconciled again. Various instances of self-reflection can be discerned on the epistemic level. In his Nobel speech, looking back on his experiences, Stafford suggests that the failure of the Harvard team to replicate the results was due to a procedural discrepancy that was âreally quite trivialâ, adding that âif there is one lesson to be learned from this experience, itâs that even the smallest details should be put in oneâs notebook â¦ You never know which details may turn out to be crucialâ (p. 198). This self-reflection not only concurs with the principles of experimental methodology, but also with the psychoanalytic rule that one should report any observations; that one should take care not to exclude any of them, for in principle nothing is irrelevantâ. Even seemingly trivial details (the bagatelle) may prove to be highly significant (Freud 1917/1940, p. 297). But in the novel, the role of the analyst, listening to the dialogues (the flow of university discourse) with evenly-poised attention, and from an oblique perspective, falls to Leah, the expert in Bachtinian analysis (p. 82). She is not at all interested in proteins, membranes or arginine, but rather in the grammar of biomolecular discourse. When challenged to share her observations (by Jean Ardley, Leahâs supervisor, who happens to visit them), she points to the remarkably role of the term âweâ in experimental discourse. Why do scientists always use the pluralis majestatis (âWe, scientistsâ, âWe, the authorsâ) when speaking about science? What is wrong"

Experiment NA34 addressed spectra of dileptons, a signature of dense hadronic matter. All experiments had to master measuring the global event character, like impact parameter, multiplicity of charged particles, transverse energy flow, etc., which some did only after many years of trial and error. Hope was that we should find in the QGP temperatures above âHagedornâs limiting temperatureâ, recognized as the freeze-out temperature for hadrons from a cooling down QGP. In nearly all SPS experiments, Rolf Hagedornâs limiting temperature was found in various measured hadron spectra. The strangeness QGP signature was particularly successful. Strangeness and more specifically strange antibaryons were recognized and developed by J. Rafelski, at times in collaborations involving R. Hagedorn, B. Muller, M. Danos, as the key to the QGP discovery. In the early years, both QGP and abundant strangeness, were very âexoticâ topics. As an example, Johannâs strangeness presentation was relegated to the âexoticaâ section of the LBL conference proceedings in 1983 in company of âAnomalonsâ, a long forgotten false discovery. With a strong experimental program and clear objectives at SPS, very strong and diverse evidence for QGP was discovered in study of strange hadrons, in particular strange antibaryons. My WA93 collaboration discovered flow phenomena in 200 A GeV S+Au collisions at a level of 5â10 times weaker than at the Bevalac. As mentioned earlier, this became then a real industry of v1 and v2 measurements, now extended to much higher orders. My groupâs experimental series WA80/93/98 was keen to measure direct photons, developed exquisite technologies and methods to do so. Some predicted QGP-temperatures of up to 1 GeV in early stages of the SPS collisions. In retrospect we can say that this was impossible, as this would require huge compressed energy densities and very short thermalisation times. This is indeed impossible to achieve even at the LHC. In our initial optimism we hoped to measure these extreme conditions, but were realistic enough to prepare for low thermal photon yields of thermal = ratios of a few percent only. However, the extreme values never showed up, and we could only measure an upper limit for thermal photons from a plasma with a temperature of about 220 MeV. At RHIC, our WA98 photon spectrometer was employed again and could measure indeed direct photons telling a temperature of about 280 MeV of the QGP."
21,26,0.243,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"sell to the mass market of the blind so they will narrow the glimpse down even more. They could be educators and help the blind learn how to see; this is what science has done for the entire human race. But learning to see is a chore, so most, especially marketing people, are not interested. This is too bad, especially when we consider the efforts the two-eyed people like Ted have to go through to even have a glimpse happen. One of the keys is for the two-eyed people to turn into evangelists. Both Ted and our mutual hero, Douglas Engelbart, worked tirelessly over their lifetimes to point out that, in this dial-tone world, the emperor not only has no clothes but his cell phone canât transmit real music. Yes, Iâve mixed a metaphor or two. Another key is to make a working system of the future. This was ARPAâs and especially PARCâs main mission. Make something that works, not just for a demo, but for a group of people. Some of what I showed during my talk is what Steve Jobs saw, and the Macintosh was a result of his glimpse and also interpretations of that glimpse by him and others at Apple. But it missed a number of really important ideas. Many of Tedâs and Dougâs ideas have been missed. So, with all this working against someone like Ted, why bother having visions? Standard schooling is already trying to convert two-eyed children into standard children, that is, into blind children. Why not just put more effort into this and save all the bother? To me, the visionaries are the most important people we have because it is only by comparing their ideas with our normal ideas that we can gauge how we are doing. Otherwise, as it is for most people, normal becomes reality, and they only measure from that less broad view of reality. Toss Ted back into this mix, and youâve upset the Apple cartâand thatâs what we need! This allows us to see that normal is only one of many possible constructions of reality, and some of them could have been much better. In addition, the normal ideas in the future could be very different and much better from what is considered reality today. Letâs be very thankful that we live in a place where two-eyed people were really supported in the 1960s and at least tolerated today. And let us also be thankful that we have a two-eyed person like Ted Nelson who has been tirelessly energetic about not just having ideas but also about going out and telling people about those ideas, not letting them die, not letting them get absorbed into the low-pass filter.

78,340,0.242,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In scientific terms, humans are treated as mere scientific objects, i.e., they are elucidated with a view to predict and/or to manipulate them7. As pointed out by Arendt, the scientific discourse is indexed on necessity: âwhat science and the quest of knowledge are after is irrefutable truth, that is, propositions human beings are not free to rejectâthey are compellingâ (Arendt 1978, p. 59). In scientific terms, contingency is just another name for âepistemic failureâ, a not-yet-known. By denoting contingency with the term uncertainty, i.e., as a negative, certainty is made the norm or the ideal. And scientific knowledge is paired with certainty of facts, even after several decades of quantum mechanics, which rather teaches us that uncertainty and indeterminacy are intrinsic to scientific knowledge as well. This scientific register positions humans as an object of enquiry, a âmaterialâ, inherently heteronomous i.e., as fully determined by external materials, forces and processes. When considered in ethical terms, as Arendt put it ironically, âattemps to define human nature almost invariably end with some construction of a deityâ¦â (Arendt 1959, p. 12). Furthermore, she reckons that freedom has wrongly been identified with sovereignty in political and philosophical thought: âIf it were true that sovereignty and freedom are the same, then indeed no man could be free, because sovereignty, the ideal of uncompromising self-sufficiency and mastership, is contradictory to the very condition of plurality. No man can be sovereign because not one man, but men, inhabit the earthâand not, as the tradition since Plato holds, because of manâs limited strength, which makes him depend upon the help of othersâ (Arendt 1959, p. 210). Understanding freedom as sovereignty has a huge price, the price of reality: âsovereignty is possible only in imagination, paid for by the price of realityâ (Arendt 1959, p. 211). Ethical/philosophical narratives of what it is to be human contend with the need to escape from, or at least to balance with,"

Let us, for the sake of a more explicit (but not formal and in a rather algorithmic way) demonstration what could happen, consider a supposedly and hypothetically universal predictor.

The screening of measures is a cyclic process. Assessing the measures will contribute to a better understanding of their effectiveness and new ones may be identiï¬ed (comprehension loop). Combinations of measures may be considered for speciï¬c parts of the WRS, for instance for solving the water quality problems in a subbasin. The result of the screening process is a set of promising measures that can be used for strategy design. The whole process of base case and reference case analysis and screening is depicted in Fig. 13.9. No regrets A special category of promising measures are the âno regrets.â More realistic we should speak of âlikely no regretsâ and âlow-regretâ measures. These are measures on which there is a very large agreement among the decision-makers and stakeholders that these should absolutely be implemented, preferably as soon as possible. It should be ascertained that these measures will not have negative impacts on other measures or will prevent other possible promising measures to be implemented. The reason to deï¬ne such no regret measures is that in quite some situations there is a huge pressure to actual implement measures and not to wait till (another) big integrated study has been completed and accepted in its full extend. In particular in developing countries there is a big need for proposals for such measures. These measures can proceed immediately to step IV on Action Planning."
272,101,0.241,Reconsidering Constitutional Formation Ii Decisive Constitutional Normativity : From Old Liberties To New Precedence (Volume 12.0),"The United States Constitution was meant to be a ground-breaking document. Given this, its preamble, beginning with the phraseology â[w]e the people of America do hereby declareâ, seems uncharacteristically cautious. There is no other explicit reference to the sovereignty question within the preamble. This is perhaps because of the perceived experimental character of the Constitution itself, and its aim to establish an expansive federal republic by majority decision. The architects of the Constitution were well aware of this character. In his Federalist Paper No. 85, Alexander Hamilton invoked the words the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume, in order to point out that â[t]o balance a large state or society [â¦] on general laws, is a work of so great difï¬culty [that] time must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they INEVITABLY fall into in their ï¬rst trials and experiments.â222 The delineation of competencies between the Union and the States (Art. 1, sec. 8, 9, 10) is, along with the separation of powers (Art. I, sec. 1 and Art. 2, sec. 1)223 the leading constitutional theme in the organisation of the United States. The address to an internal and external defensive sovereignty224 is not necessary. The Constitution articulated the rights of the Congress in legislation (Art. I, sec. 8) âthe classical rights of sovereigntyâand reduced correspondingly the rights of the union states, thus demonstrating the focus on the division of sovereignty between union and union states. It designed a federal state with a strong centralised power. With the American founding fathers having Blackstoneâs Commentaries as a"
