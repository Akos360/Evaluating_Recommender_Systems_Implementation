175,592,0.459,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Bayesian procedures provide another approach that is related to maximum likelihood estimation. Bayesian inference employs the likelihood function to represent the information in the data. That information is augmented with a prior distribution that describes what is known about constraints on the parameters and their likely values beyond the information provided by the recorded data available at a site. The likelihood function and the prior probability density function are combined to obtain the probability density function that describes the posterior distribution of the parameters fh Ã°hjx1 ; x2 ; . . .; xn Ã / fX Ã°x1 ; x2 ; . . .; xn jhÃnÃ°hÃ Ã°6:70Ã The symbol â means âproportional toâ and Î¾(Î¸) is the probability density function for the prior distribution for Î¸ (Kottegoda and Rosso 1997). Thus, except for a constant of proportionality, the probability density function describing the posterior distribution of the parameter vector Î¸ is equal to the product of the likelihood function fX(x1, x2, â¦, xn|Î¸) and the probability density function for the prior distribution Î¾(Î¸) for Î¸. Advantages of the Bayesian approach are that it allows the explicit modeling of uncertainty in parameters (Stedinger 1997; Kuczera 1999), and provides a theoretically consistent framework for integrating systematic flow records with regional and other hydrologic information (Vicens et al. 1975; Stedinger 1983; and Kuczera 1983). Martins and Stedinger (2000) illustrate how a prior distribution can be used to enforce realistic constraints upon a parameter as well as providing a description of its likely values. In their case use of a prior of the shape parameter Îº of a GEV distribution allowed deï¬nition of generalized maximum likelihood estimators that over the Îº-range of interest performed substantially better than maximum likelihood, moment, and L-moment estimators. While Bayesian methods have been available for decades, the computational challenge posed by the solution of Eq. 6.70 has been an obstacle to their use. Solutions to Eq. 6.70 have been"

The graph that results from plotting these values as described is similar to the segregation curve in one key respect; under conditions of exact even distribution, the curves for the White and Black population will coincide with the diagonal line for the total population. So the diagonal is a reference point for even distribution. A key difference from the segregation curve is that under conditions of uneven distribution, the curve for the cumulating proportion of the Black population will rise above the diagonal and the curve for the cumulating proportion of the White population will fall below the diagonal. Like the segregation curve, the areas between the curves and the diagonal in this graph have relationships to the values of G and D. This should not be surprising since the information plotted is very similar to the information plotted in the segregation curve. However, the visual representation here is distinct. One feature of this graphical device is that the diagonal directly reflects relative rank position on area proportion White (p). Thus, the contrast between the diagonal and the curves for Whites and Blacks provides a basis for grasping their differences in relative rank position. A curve that rises above the diagonal is skewed toward below average rank positions. A curve that falls below the diagonal is skewed toward above average rank positions. The implications of the curves for group means on relative rank position are depicted graphically by plotting two vertical lines; one indicates the value of mean relative rank for Whites (YW) and the other indicates mean relative rank for Blacks (YB). Under conditions of exact even distribution, these will necessarily coincide at the value of 0.50, the overall mean on relative rank for area proportion White (p). Where these two values differ, the value for YW exceeds 0.50 and is necessarily higher than the value of YB which falls below 0.50. As noted earlier, the logical range for YW is from 0.5 to Q + ( P 2 ) and the logical range of YB is from Q/2 to 0.5, and the maximum value for (YW â YB) is 0.5 which occurs under complete segregation. The graphs in the figure are organized by two rows and three columns. The three columns are for three conditions for segregation. The graphs in the first (leftmost) column are for the extreme condition of exact even distribution where the value of G is 0. The graphs in the third (rightmost) column are for the opposite extreme condition of complete segregation where the value of G is 100. The graphs in the middle column are for substantial, but not complete, segregation where the value of G is 0.900.9 The two rows are for two conditions of city racial composition.

Alternatively, because we are usually a lot more certain about our data than we are about the truth of our model, we might ask what is the likelihood of our model, given the data: l(Î¸ |X ). These two quantities are different ways of expressing the same idea, but they embody a fundamentally different approach. You need to think about this last paragraph until the penny drops. The fundamental part of Bayesian statistics is that the posterior distribution p(Î¸ |X ) is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood: p(Î¸ |X ) â p(Î¸ ) Ã l(Î¸ |X ). This tells us how to modify our existing beliefs in the light of the newly available data.

TEM00 beams present several interesting properties. The intensity profile of these beams maintain a Gaussian shape regardless of the selection of the cross section along the propagation axis z. Furthermore, these beams present a relatively low divergence; this is a measure of how large the variation of the spot size w(z) is along z.

Although the distributions will almost certainly not be exactly the same (say a Gaussian distribution) because they result from measurements in the real world, since both sensors are subject to the same types of variability (sensor noise, uneven floor surface) it is likely that they will be similar. If the two distributions are similar, the means of the samples of each sensor will be more-or-less in the same place with respect to the distributions. The average of the means for each sensor will be equidistant from corresponding points in the data sets.

311,474,0.312,The Physics of the B Factories,"11.1 Formalism of maximum likelihood ï¬ts The ï¬nal step in a physics analysis, after appropriate event selection and reconstruction steps have been performed, is extracting a statement on a physics parameter of interest from the observed distribution of events in the data. To make such an estimation, a model must be formulated that describes the expected distribution of the observable quantities x for a given set of physics parameters of interest p. Then, given an observed data sample x0 one uses the relation between x and p described by the model to infer a statement on the value p for which the observed data is most likely. A standard technique to make such an inference is a maximum likelihood estimator. In this section the basics of this technique are described, starting with a description of probability density function as a means to model the observed data density, followed by a brief description of the maximum likelihood formalism and a discussion on the structure of typical models used for B-physics data modeling."
165,123,0.311,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"of the three and leads to milder nonlinearity in the y-p relationship and larger changes in y as p moves from 20 to 70. In each group comparison the changes in y as p moves from 20 to 70 are smaller than the 50 point increase in y observed for S for the same group comparisons. This is because the y-p relationship is linear for S and nonlinear for H. The nonlinearity in the y-p relationship for H creates a large region in the middle portion of the range of p where the slope of the curve is less than 1.0 and thus changes in y are smaller than changes in p.2 In addition, the degree to which changes in y are smaller than changes in p varies across the three segregation comparisons because the nonlinearity in the y-p relationship varies; specifically, the departure from linearity is more pronounced when the two groups in the comparison are more unequal in size and thus changes in y over the middle range of p are smaller in these group comparisons. The function y = f ( p ) for the Hutchens index (R) also generates values of y that fall on a smooth, ever-rising, backwards âS-curveâ. The curve is similar in form to the curve seen for the Theil index (H). But the nonlinearity in the curve for R is noticeably more pronounced. Accordingly, the patterns for the scoring of y for R are similar to those just noted for H, but âamplifiedâ. For example, as with H, changes of a fixed amount in contact with Whites (p) translate into different impacts on y depending on the initial starting value of p and relative size of the two groups. Thus, the graphs in Fig. 5.1 indicate that a family that moves from an area that is 20 % White area to an area that is 70 % White area would experience an increase of 24.2 points on scaled contact with Whites (y) in the White-Black comparison, 25.7 points in the White-Latino comparison and 18.3 points in the White-Asian comparison. The changes in y are even smaller than the changes in y noted for H because the departure from linearity in the y-p relationship for R is greater. This âflattensâ the y-p curve over the middle range of p even more and causes changes in y to be smaller than changes in p. As seen with H, the changes in y vary across the different segregation comparisons; they are larger when groups are more equal in size and smaller when groups are more unequal in size. The function y = f ( p ) for the gini index (G/2) also produces an ever-rising, backwards âS-curveâ. However, in contrast to the functions for H and R, this curve is irregular rather than smooth. This is because G tracks percentile scores for p and these depend not on the specific value of contact with Whites (p) itself, but instead on how values of p translate into rank position on contact with Whites. In the case of White-Black segregation, for example, this is determined by the number of Whites and Blacks living in areas where p higher and the number of Whites and Blacks living in areas where p is lower. The nonlinearity of the function for G/2 is more pronounced than that seen for the functions for H and R and this produces larger departures from the diagonal line for S. As a result, it is reasonable to say that scoring y as the percentile transformation of p is as the most âdramaticâ rescaling of contact of those considered here. Thus, the graphs in Fig. 5.1 indicate that a family"

In this measurement, we place slit-B, which has the same width as that of slit-A, coincident with the 1:1 ghost image of slit-A and measure the diffraction pattern by scanning DB along the y-axis in far-ï¬eld. In this measurement, we learn the value of Îpy due to the diffraction of a real slit of Îy. Measurement-II is illustrated in the lower part of . Fig. 16.25 .

29,112,0.308,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","maps of the visual field, where the primary visual area V1 and the higher order area MT act as anchors, a concept that has been generalized recently to a tethering hypothesis where conserved, regionally localized patterning centers ensure the observed stereotypic localization of primary areas during the massive cortical expansion that accompanies phylogenesis (Buckner and Krienen 2013). The tethering hypothesis speculates that the primary cortical areas would be integrated into the cortical network in a very different fashion from the association cortex, the latter being characterized by a greater abundance of long-distance connections. Our results do not support this speculation, but they do suggest a major difference. Whereas the primary cortical areas are located in the fans of the bowtie, the association cortex is part of the high-density cortical core and is part of the knot of the bowtie (Ercsey-Ravasz et al. 2013). The above considerations go some way in explaining the developmental and phylogenetic basis of the high functional clustering of areas, thereby forming distinct constellations of areas centered on visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor and cognitive functions. The recent tract tracing data in both macaque and mouse and the network analysis of inter-areal connectivity begin to provide a coherent picture of the high-density cortical network. The anatomy tells us that there are many more connections than previously suspected, including numerous low-weight long-distance connections that can only be detected by connectomic approaches (Markov et al. 2014b; Oh et al. 2014; Zingg et al. 2014). It would be wise to resist the temptation to ignore such connections. The variables of functional and structural parameters, including synaptic weights and transmission probability, EPSPs, spine sizes, firing rates, correlations of population synchrony and axon diameters, show skewed log normal distributions (Buzsaki and Mizuseki 2014). Hence, at multiple levels, assemblies of many weak and few strong elements seem to be a characteristic feature of what makes brains work. With regards to the weak interareal connections, while their band-width will exclude dense information transfer, there is ample possibility for them to play a role in contraction dynamics of oscillatory coherence (Wang and Slotine 2005) and hence in shaping communication across the cortex (Fries 2005). The potential importance of the long-distance weak connection in the cortex, at least superficially, echoes that of the strength of weak ties in social networks, reputed to be important in integrating the individual into the social fabric (Granovetter 1973)."

Supposing HFTs have different latencies, Fig. 6.7 depicts the return difference among LFTs, normal HFTs and the fastest HFT. In the result, the red curve shows the average individual return of HFTs, it decreases with the increase of HFTs percentage and can be seen as the return of a normal HFT. Since LFTsâ population is much more than HFTsâ and their average return can be seen as zero, the red curve also illustrates the return difference between a normal HFT and a LFT approximately, and can be taken as a reference for a LFT to decide whether it is worth taking part in HFT. The green curve, on the other hand, is calculated as the difference between the average and the highest return (return of the HFT with the lowest latency). It can be interpreted as how much potential profit can be earned for a normal HFT to become the fastest one by renewing its devices or using co-location method. This chart may suggest that although the profit for becoming a HFT decreases with the increase of HFTs, it is always profitable for a HFT to pursue lower latency. Fig. 6.7 Individual return of"

291,114,0.307,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The panel on the left denotes the probability to survive for another 5 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer, regardless of the actual cause of death. The figure exhibits an obvious age gradient: Values of 30% or less at ages above 90 are the consequence that the women are not only at an elevated risk of dying from breast cancer. Other causes, most notably circulatory diseases, further reduce the chances to survive for five more years. Consequently, the upward trend of the contour lines can not be interpreted as progress made against the lethality of breast cancer. Still it provides the answer to the question âHow likely is it that I survive for another five years?â for someone who got diagnosed with breast cancer. While the left panel takes all âexitâ possibilities into account, the panel in the middle looks only at death from breast cancer. As a consequence, one minus the depicted value equals the probability to die from breast cancer within 5 years after diagnosis. The rather vertical lines from about age 40 to about age 80 indicate that the chance of surviving breast cancer for at least 5 years has increased over time. For instance, the probability for 60-year-old women who got diagnosed with breast cancer in 1980 to survive 5 years was 80%; the equivalent value in 2000 was higher than 90%. To express it even more positively: The risk of dying was cut in half within less than 20 years (1980: 1 0:8 D 20%; 1995 W 1 0:9 D 10%)! The panel on the right of Fig. 10.3 shows ârelative survivalâ, i.e., it illustrates the relative survival disadvantage of those diagnosed with breast cancer in relation to the general population. A level of one would indicate that there was no difference in the chance to survive for five more years between someone with a cancer diagnosis and the general population. Unfortunatelyâbut also not surprisinglyâwomen with breast cancer have lower survival chances than the general population. We can detect, however, progress over time. The excess risk is less than 10% in recent years for women with breast cancer in comparison to the general population (contour line of 0.9) whereas it was about 30% just 25 years earlier. It is important to point out that the increasing values of the vertical lines suggest a clear period effect: Progress against breast cancer was faster than progress in survival in general, regardless of the age when the woman was diagnosed. It is theoretically possible to observe relative survival estimates that are higher than one. For instance, it could be the outcome of a selection effect: Persons that take advantage of screening programs and other early preventive measures are possibly leading rather healthy lifestyles. If those persons are diagnosed with a cancer that is virtually non-lethal, their survival advantage of their health behavior might be stronger than the additional mortality risk of the malignant neoplasm. Hence, it can not be concluded that getting diagnosed with a certain cancer could actually improve survival chances. We would argue, though, that the small area at ages 90â 95 in 2000 is not the outcome of such a selection effect. Instead, we assume that it is the outcome of random data fluctuations due to small numbers of persons getting diagnosed. For example, 46 women at age 93 were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000. The corresponding estimates for colorectal cancer are depicted in Figs. 10.4 and 10.5 for women and men, respectively (pages 129 & 130). Both sexes feature comparable estimates.

We assume an inverse square distance function for the weights, wi,j. The weight can be computed by radiation transport equations [11]. The range is typically considered to be equal to the flight height, following Torii et al. [6]. We assume that the error ej includes not only measurement errors associated with hardware (such as instrument noises) but also the uncertainty associated with other factors (such as the variable height of buildings, small-scale spatial variability). In this example, we assume that ej follows an independent normal distribution with zero-mean and the error variance rA can be determined from the correlation analysis between two datasets. As a process model, we assume that y is a multivariate Gaussian ï¬eld described by geostatistical parameters. For simplicity, we assume that the ground-based measurements have insigniï¬cant errors compared to the airborne measurements, and hence we use the ground measurements as conditional points to constrain the distribution of y as p(y|zV). Since two conditional distributions are both multivariate Gaussian, we can derive an analytical form of this posterior distribution as a multivariate normal distribution with mean Qâ1g and covariance Qâ1, where T â1 T â1 Q = Râ1 c +A D A and l = lc + A D zA [7]. In Q and g, lc and Rc are the conditional mean and covariance given the ground-based data (zV) and geostatistical parameters. D is the data-error covariance matrix; each of the diagonal components is rA. The matrix A is n-by-mA sparse matrices, where Aij = wij if i-th pixel is within the range Cj; otherwise Aij is 0. We may directly sample y or estimate the mean (or expected) dose map by Qâ1g. Although the example shown here is quite simple, we may add more complexity, such as, for example, physics-based radiation transport models (instead of weighted averaging) to represent the airborne data or data-derived correlations between dose rates and land use or topography [2]."

The figures document similarity in the form of the response. One must note the values on the âYâ scale in the figures to see that the responses by H are milder than the responses by R. What distinguishes H from R is this. H is rooted in a conception of uneven distribution that draws on the information-theoretic notion of relative deviation from expected entropy. Individuals who find this conceptual approach attractive may accordingly prefer H. But like G, D, and R, H is differentially sensitive to changes in p over relatively narrow ranges and the relevant ranges vary with city racial mix.

The associated model governing the deterministic probability density functions is also 2D in the sense that the model depends on two spatial variables: the concentration of Ca2C in the dyad and in the JSR.

311,944,0.297,The Physics of the B Factories,"variables derived from the observables in the p.d.f.s. Sometimes, a two-dimensional p.d.f. is used. A third option is to create a p.d.f. based on one of the observables, where the p.d.f. parameters (e.g. means and widths) are dependent on the other observable. A standard set of cross-checks on the fit is performed. The p.d.f.s are used to generate a series of simulated data samples that are then fitted with the ML method. This reveals any problems with minimization, pulls and biases. The tests are repeated with data samples generated from the full MC simulated data; this can reveal problems with correlations between observables. The ML fit is sometimes performed on a calibration channel taken from the data, such as a charm decay to the same or similar final state as the B meson decay under consideration. In this case, the ML model is simplified (e.g. no angular observables are used), any charm vetoes are removed, and all the model parameters are floated, if possible. This can reveal any differences between the MC simulation and data in the mES and ÎE signal distributions, which can then be corrected for in the final fit. The systematic uncertainties for the result are often separated into two categories and will depend on the measurement under consideration. Additive systematics aï¬ect the fit yield and hence the significance of a branching fraction measurement. Multiplicative systematics aï¬ect the central value of the result but not the significance. In the additive category, we place uncertainties on the accuracy of the fixed parameters in the p.d.f.s, any ML fit biases in extracting the yields, model-dependent parameters (such as the mean and width of poorly known resonances), the presence or absence of uncertain resonances (such as the Ï(600)), interference, BB background yields, and uncertainty on the longitudinal polarization fL . In a large number of modes, the uncertainty on the fixed parameters extracted from the MC simulation is the dominant systematic (see Chapter 15 for more details on systematic error estimation). In the multiplicative category falls the reconstruction eï¬ciency uncertainties arising from diï¬erences between data and MC simulation from tracking, uncertainties in the branching fractions of any intermediate decays, charged particle identification, neutral particle (Ï 0 ) identification, and long-lived particle (KS0 ) identification. Also, the accuracy of the known BB cross-section, luminosity and limited MC statistics can contribute. If various sub-decays are combined (e.g. K â+ â KS0 Ï + or K + Ï 0 ) to form an overall measurement, the multiplicative systematics are correlated and must be added linearly. Many of the systematic errors associated with fL and ACP cancel since these two measurements are based on ratios of signal yields. The systematic uncertainty on ACP caused by the detector responding diï¬erently to positive and negative tracks or the presence of s and s in K â and K + respectively is generally considered to be 0.5% at most. Once calculated, the systematic error is convolved with the likelihood function with a Gaussian distribution with a variance equal to the total systematic error (see â Chapter 15). The signal significance is then defined as 2Î ln L,"

45,265,0.296,Measurement and Control of Charged Particle Beams,"This can be seen by inspecting the raw data shown in Fig. 4.4. For more complex beam distributions, a somewhat better characterization is achieved by applying an âasymmetric Gaussianâ fit to the wire-scan measurement, in which the left and right hand sides of the measured beam profile are approximated independently by two separate Gaussians. For example, the fitting function used at the SLC [7] was (x â x)2 (4.37) f (x) = f0 + fmax exp â 2x2 (1 + Î±[sign(x â x)] where Î± represents an asymmetry factor and is zero for a perfect Gaussian2 . The Ï for the left and right hand sides of the fitted distribution are Ï = x2 (1 Â± Î±). For the ellipse reconstruction the average Ï was used. When large tails are present in the raw data this more accurately represents the beam distribution. Based on the raw data it is clear, however, that even with the more sophisticated fitting algorithm, the fit only marginally represents the actual distributions. For reasonably well âmatchedâ beams, the graphical summary display is most useful for quick evaluation of the beam. In this example the deviations between the design and measured ellipse in the graphics suggest that a closer inspection of the raw data may be warranted. The âdouble-humpsâ in the single-wire measurements are characteristic of an upstream error; a beam, if kicked transversely, will filament, i.e., it loses coherency due to the natural spread in the phase advance between particles, resulting in an increased emittance and the characteristic double humps. If a wire is mounted at 45â¦ with respect to x and y (a âu-planeâ wire), then it is also possible to measure the coupling between the horizontal and vertical plane.

These are often called allometric relationships because when b = 1 the proportion of x that becomes y varies with x. An important empirical relationship from ecological entomology that has applications in a wide range of statistical analysis is known as Taylorâs power law. It has to do with the relationship between the variance and the mean of a sample. In elementary statistical models, the variance is assumed to be constant (i.e. the variance does not depend upon the mean). In ï¬eld data, however, Taylor found that variance increased with the mean according to a power law, such that on logâlog axes the data from most systems fell above a line through the origin with slope = 1 (the pattern shown by data that are Poisson distributed, where the variance is equal to the mean) and below a line through the origin with a slope of 2.

Unfortunately, flows are not always adequately described by the normal distribution. In fact, streamflows and many other hydrologic data cannot really be normally distributed because of the impossibility of negative values. In general, distributions of hydrologic data are positively skewed having a lower bound near zero and, for practical purposes, an unbounded right-hand tail. Thus they look like the gamma or lognormal distribution illustrated in Figs. 6.3 and 6.4. The asymmetry of a distribution is often measured by its coefï¬cient of skewness.

In each case, the changes in y are even smaller than the changes in y seen for H and R because the pronounced nonlinearity in the y-p relationship for G âflattensâ the y-p curve over the middle range of p quite dramatically causing changes in y to be much smaller than changes in p. As observed previously for H and R, the changes in y vary across the different segregation comparisons with changes being larger when groups are more similar in size and smaller when are more unequal in size. Thus, the change in y for the White-Latino comparison, where the two groups are more similar in size, is more than four times larger than the change in y for the White-Asian comparison where the two groups are more unequal in size. In contrast to S, H, R, and G, the scoring of y for the index of dissimilarity (D) is not ever-rising as p increases. Instead, it follows a simple, two-value, monotonic step function. The scoring of y for D/2 shown in the graphs draws on the formulation of D as a version of G computed from a two-category ranking scheme with areas where p Â³ P being in the higher ranking category and all other areas being in the lower ranked category. For example, in the White-Black comparison, y is scored 14.6 when p < P and 64.6 when p Â³ P .3 The scoring of y for D could alternatively be shown as a step function where values of y are either at 0 or 100 depending on whether p is above P or not. But I present the D/2 formulation here to facilitate the comparison of D with G. The step function for D/2 produces a rescaling of contact that responds to changes in p only when p crosses from being below P to equaling or exceed it. As the graph in Fig. 5.1 indicates, this does not occur when a family moves from an area that is 20 % White area to an area that is 70 % White area in the White-Black comparison. So a family making this move would experience no change in scaled contact with Whites (y); y is 14.6 when p is 20 and y remains at this value when p is 70. The same is true in the White-Asian comparison. In contrast, the change in y for a family making a comparable move in the White-Latino comparison would be 50.0 points (the maximum possible change under the D/2 formulation). These results highlight two things about D. They highlight that D responds to changes in p only when p crosses a specific value and otherwise D is insensitive to changes in p. The examples also highlight that the value of p that D responds to differs from one segregation comparison to another based on group size. Thus, when groups are equal in size, D responds to changes in p at 50 % White and when the minority group is smaller in size, D responds to changes in p at increasingly higher levels. Thus, the 50 point change in y occurs when p crosses from below to above"

Let us initially consider equally distributed marginals S X 1 (x) = S X 2 (x) = S X (x). If S X (x) is exponentially distributed, then S(x1 , x2 ) = CÎ± (S X 1 (x1 ), S X 2 (x2 )) is a particular case of the MarshallâOlkinâs bivariate exponential distribution, see [9], possessing BLMP and, consequently, belonging to the class A . Now, let X be gamma distributed random variable. In this case, BLMP does not hold true but the corresponding joint survival function still belongs to A . In a third scenario, where X 1 and X 2 do not share the same distribution but are joined by the Cuadras-AugÃ© survival copula, S(x1 , x2 ) neither possesses BLMP nor belongs to A .

Let us consider a baseline survival function S X (x) and substitute S X 1 (x) = [S X (x)]Î± and S X 2 (x) = [S X (x)]Î² . Then, the corresponding joint survival function S(x1 , x2 ) = CÎ±,Î² (S X 1 (x1 ), S X 2 (x2 )) belongs to A . In particular, if the marginals are exponentially distributed, not necessarily sharing the same parameter, then S(x1 , x2 ) possesses BLMP. But choosing X 1 exponentially distributed and X 2 beta distributed, say the corresponding joint survival function is not a member of the class A . The cases considered in the last two examples depend on the choice of the marginal survival functions. A general invariance property can be obtained when we consider the Clayton survival copula. In such a case, for any marginals we have time invariant survival copulas. We refer the reader to Sect. 4 in [2] for more details on time invariant copulas. In fact, the Clayton survival copula is the only absolutely continuous copula that is preserved even under bivariate truncation, see [11]. The absolutely continuous assumption is relaxed in Theorem 4.1 in [3]. In [10], it is given a characterization of the survival functions which simultaneously have Clayton survival copula and possess BLMP, see their Theorem 3.2. In the next statement, we establish a necessary condition to an absolutely continuous bivariate survival function be a member of the class A ."

Since the interpretations and assumptions behind the sectors variables and the corresponding counterparty specific sector weights are different, we will use an individual notation for each model. In CreditMetrics, the vector of sector variables X = (X 1 , . . . , X K )T is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. Therefore, each sector variable X k=1,...,K has a standard normal law and the copula of X = (X 1 , . . . , X K )T is a Gaussia one with dispersion matrixÎ£. Within CreditRisk+ , the sector variables Sk are assumed to follow a Gamma law with specific shape and scale parameters, such that E (Sk ) = 1 for all k = 1, . . . , K . The choice of the Gamma distribution was motivated by the fact that in combination with Poisson distributed defaults, the loss distribution can be derived analytically. In order to specify the sector distributions, the sector variances Ïk2 can be estimated from empirical data, for example, insolvency rates. In the original model of 1997, the variables Sk are also assumed to be independent of each other. In contrast, we apply the so-called CBV approach, which is an extension, published by Fischer and Dietz [23], with respect to correlated sectors.

372,1360,0.288,Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy : Third Edition (Edition 3),"because the spatial sensitivity function of the antenna falls to low levels as a result of the tapered illumination of the reflector. Missing data at low .u; v/ values result in broad negative sidelobes of the synthesized beam, such that the beam appears to be situated in a shallow bowl-shaped depression. This effect is most noticeable when the field to be imaged is wide enough that there are several empty .u; v/ cells within the central area. The transfer function AN .u/ is the autocorrelation function of the field distribution over the antenna aperture and depends on the particular design of the antenna, including the illumination pattern of the feed. The solid curve in Fig. 11.7 shows AN for a uniformly illuminated circular aperture, which can be regarded as an ideal case. Since there is usually some tapering in the illumination of a reflector antenna, in practice, AN will generally fall off somewhat more rapidly than the curves shown. The function AN in Fig. 11.7 is proportional to the common area of two overlapping circles of diameter d, and the abscissa is the distance between their centers. In three dimensions, this function is sometimes referred to as the Chinese hat function, and its properties are discussed by Bracewell (1995). The dashed curves in Fig. 11.7 show the relative spatial sensitivity for an interferometer using two uniformly illuminated circular apertures of diameter d. Curve 1 is for a spacing of 1:4d between the centers of the apertures; curve 2 is for a spacing of 1:25d. If both total-power and interferometer data are obtained, it can be seen that the minimum sensitivity occurs for spacings of approximately half of the antenna spacing. One solution to increasing the minimum sensitivity in the spatial frequency coverage is the addition of total-power measurements from a larger antenna [see, for example, Bajaja and van Albada (1979), Welch and Thornton (1985), StanimirovicÌ (2002)].

Events with |ÎE| < 300 MeV are typically accepted, although an asymmetric acceptance region is used if there is a chance of energy loss from photon emission or Ï 0 reconstruction. The minimum value of mES is set to allow a good fit to the mES background distribution and is rarely set less than 5.220 GeV/c2 (below this value, other selection criteria start to distort the selection eï¬ciency). The (mES , ÎE) plane is divided into regions to aid analysis. A signal region is defined around the point mES = mB , ÎE = 0 with a width roughly 3 times the resolution on mES (â¼ 3 MeV/c2 ) and ÎE (â¼ 20 â 50 MeV, depending on the number of neutral particles). Although the signal region is usually rectangular in shape, elliptical signal regions have been used e.g. Fig. 3 in (Garmash, 2005). Two sidebands are defined above and below the ÎE signal region, the upper region allowing for the study of two-body decays that have been combined with a random track and the lower region to study four-body decays that have lost a track. A further sideband below the signal region in mES can be used to study the continuum background, although care must be taken to account for any decays from B mesons. In the center-of-mass (CM) frame, the continuum background is characterized by a jet-like, back-to-back structure while the BB events have a more spherical distribution since they are produced close to rest (see Chapter 9 for details). Therefore, event shape variables are used to separate signal from this background. Many diï¬erent criteria have been used over the years including sphericity, spherocity, planarity, acoplanarity and thrust (see the Glossary and Chapter 9). In addition, angles are often measured between the direction of the B meson decay and a reference axis, such as the beam line or the direction of the rest of the event (ROE). An important example is the thrust angle in the CM frame, defined as the angle Î¸T between the thrust axis of the B meson candidate and that of the rest of the particles in an event. Signal events are uniformly distributed in cos Î¸T , while continuum events are peaked near cos Î¸T = Â±1. A requirement on cos Î¸T or | cos Î¸T | of less than 0.7 â 0.9 is usually applied. Any remaining event shape variables are combined into a multivariate discriminant that can either be used as selection criteria or as a p.d.f. observable in a ML fit. Fisher discriminants and neural networks are popular but Boosted Decision Trees (or Forests) have also been applied (see Chapter 4 for details). The number of variables is typically about six. Although discriminants with many more variables have been tried, they rarely bring any additional discrimination. The choice of variables depends on the mode under consideration, consistency with previously used discriminants, and ultimately on the prejudice of the analyst. It is important to check for correlations between the input variables and any other variables used in the ML fit. Variables that have been used over the years include (see Chapter 9 for many definitions): CLEO cones (momentum distribution in nine angular cones about the thrust vector); modified Fox-Wolfram moments (Abe, 2001c); the variable ST , the scalar sum of the transverse momenta, calculated with respect to the"

The empirical innovations of the process show heavier tails than a normal distribution (compare Stoll and Wiebauer [14]). Therefore, we apply a distribution with heavy tails. The class of generalized hyperbolic distributions including the NIG distribution was introduced by Barndorff-Nielsen [1].

Although the connection strength in mouse cortex varies over a narrower range than in macaque (Markov et al. 2011), the lognormal distribution found in both species indicates that the fundamental principles of cortical connectivity are evolutionarily conserved. In primates, visual information is processed in dorsal and ventral cortical streams specialized for âwhereâ an object is located or for guiding actions and âwhatâ an object is (Ungerleider and Mishkin 1982; Goodale and Milner 1992). If such streams exist in mice, how do they arise from a network with seemingly low binary specificity? One way this might be achieved is by routing the flow of information through pathways with different connection strengths. Consistent with this notion, we found that each source area of visual cortex had a unique profile of connection strengths. We assessed between-area similarities and found that the projection strengths among dorsal and ventral networks were distinct. The dorsal network consisted of areas AL, rostrolateral area (RL), anteromedial area (AM), posteromedial area (PM) and anterior area (A), whereas V1, LM, laterointermediate area (LI), postrhinal area (POR) and posterior area (P) were grouped in the ventral network (Wang et al. 2012). Although streams were revealed in the graph of cortex-wide connections, we wondered whether they were present in the 10  10 connectivity graph of visuotopically organized areas. The graph of projection strengths clearly grouped areas into dorsal (i.e., AL, RL, AM, PM, A) and ventral (i.e., V1, LM, LI, POR, P) communities in which connections within modules were twice as strong as those between modules. Within modules, the shortest pathways were always direct. By contrast, the shortest pathways between modules were often indirect, which means that the combined strength of the indirect path was stronger that the direct path. Thus, for communication between modules, the most effective path may be indirect. Interestingly, not a single short path linking the two modules travels through V1, indicating that, similar to cat and monkey (Sporns et al. 2007), V1 is not a network hub for interareal communication. Instead, judged by the number of connections, this role belongs to area LM. Although lower in the hierarchy than monkey V4, which has a similar status in the network, LM may play a critical role in integrative processing of visual information."

This remaining discriminating power is eï¬ciently exploited in the maximumlikelihood analysis. The monomial L0 is the total momentum ï¬ow observed in the detector, and L2 is a direction-weighted sum of contributions to the total momentum ï¬ow. Hence the ratio L2 /L0 is expected to be rather insensitive to the actual per-event value of the total momentum ï¬ow, which largely cancels in the ratio. The relative sign of the c0 , c2 coeï¬cients in F expresses the same cancellation. As a result, the simulated distributions of both F and L2 /L0 are found to be in excellent agreement with data. Some BABAR analyses have therefore preferred to use the simpler L2 /L0 ratio. Simplicity over complexity (i.e. adding L1 or splitting the ROE between charged and neutral particles) has been privileged by most BABAR analyses because the discriminating gain was found to be marginal. 9.4.2 Nonlinear discriminants Many BABAR analyses combine the information from the monomials with other variables to further enhance their discriminating power and the resulting performance in background suppression.

Mixtures of distributions have been used for a long time in statistics and may lead to heavy tails, allowing for modeling of skewed distributions and of extreme events. Given the fact that mixtures lead, in the distributions space, to linear (convex) combinations of possibly simple and well-understood distributions, they are tractable and easy to interpret. The literature on mixtures is enormous and it is impossible to do justice to all this literature here. We just hint at the fact that static mixtures of distributions had been postulated in the past to fit option prices for a given maturity, see for example [24], where a mixture of normal densities for the density of the asset log-returns under the pricing measure is assumed, and subsequently [8, 16, 20].

The AUC for risk products of 0.25% is 1.75%; (2) If the AUC was equal to or greater than 1.75%, but less than 9.82% (i.e., the AUC for risk products of 2%), then the risk was categorized as low; (3) If the AUC was equal to or greater than 9.82%, but less than 33% (i.e., the AUC for risk products of 10%), then the risk was categorized as intermediate; and (4) If the AUC was equal to or greater than 33%, then the risk was categorized as high. The risk curves defined by risk products of 0.25, 2 and 10% are shown graphically in Fig. 3. Categories of risk were based on a rationale described previously (Moore et al. 2010a, b) and included several considerations: (1) Losses of small numbers of individuals from a local population should not adversely affect the population (Giddings et al. 2005; Moore 1998). One of the foundations of hierarchy theory (Allen and Starr 1982) is that effects at lower levels of ecological organization (e.g., organism level) are not necessarily transmitted to higher levels of ecological organization (e.g., population level); (2) Although there are exceptions, an adverse effect level of 10% is unlikely to be ecologically significant to a local population. Such an effect generally cannot be reliably confirmed by field studies (Moore 1998; Suter et al. 2000); (3) Based on an analysis of EPA regulatory practice, Suter et al. (2000) concluded that decreases in an ecological assessment endpoint of less than 20% are generally acceptable; (4) The curve corresponding to a risk product of 2% passes through the points corresponding to a very low probability (i.e., 10%) of 20% or greater effect, and a low probability (i.e., 20%) of 10% or greater effect. Thus, based on the considerations described above, if risk products are generally less than the 2% boundary for an exposure scenario, then it can almost certainly be considered a low risk scenario; (5) The curve corresponding to a risk product of 10% passes through the points corresponding to a median probability (i.e., 50%) of 20% or greater effect and a 20% probability of 50% or greater effect.

In this extraction some improvements in the knowledge of the Collins function are still needed. For example, the intrinsic transverse momentum dependence is not known and was only estimated. Recent results have been shown by BABAR (Garzia, 2013), with an analysis similar to that performed by Belle and based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 468 fbâ1 collected at the Î¥ (4S) and 40 MeV below.

29,101,0.278,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","The G29  29 graph has a density of 66 % and it does not have a SF (power law) degree distribution, neither for the in- nor the out-degrees (see Fig. 3; a SF degree distribution falls as a power law as a function of the degree). Thus, for dense networks, alternative methods are needed to detect their core-periphery structure. We introduced a novel method to detect core-periphery structures in dense graphs based on a clique distribution analysis (Ercsey-Ravasz et al. 2013). A clique is a subset of nodes that have all the possible connections between them. The largest clique in the G29  29 has ten nodes, and there are 13 such cliques of 10 in G29  29, all involving only 17 nodes, forming the core of G29  29 with a very high density of 92 %. The rest of the nodes form the periphery with a 49 % density of connections and a density of 54 % of connections between core and periphery nodes (ErcseyRavasz et al. 2013). This is a clear-cut core-periphery structure with a core of 92 % density surrounded by the rest of the graph having roughly 50 % density. The probability for seeing such a core-periphery structure in a random graph with the same number of nodes and edges is 1017, infinitesimally small. So why doesnât the rich-club measure (2) pick out this structure? The explanation lies with the second expression in Eq. (2), which shows that the normalized measure is simply the fraction of edges between the larger-than-k degree nodes and the same quantity for the randomly rewired network. Thus, this rich-club coefficient will be large only if the randomized network has a significantly reduced density between the same set of nodes. That can only happen in a sparse network and if the degree distribution is heterogeneous as well. In our network, due to its high density, even by random rewiring we cannot reduce significantly the density of connections between these particular nodes. Additionally, the networkâs degree distribution is not very heterogeneous; Table 1 and Figs. 3 and 4 show that most of the nodes are high-degree nodes. In particular, area 8l has an in-degree of 28, thus receiving connections from all the others within G29  29. There are 12 nodes with in-degree 20 or larger, meaning that 41.3 % of all nodes receive connections from at least 20/29 ï¬ 69 %"

231,267,0.278,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Care should be taken if the precipitation fraction exceeding the 95th percentile (R95pTOT) is determined over a climatological period of several decades, since extremes may have increased disproportionally and thus the shape of the distribution may have changed. For example, an index S95pTOT, using the Weibull shape parameter instead of an explicit estimate of the 95th percentile, can be used (Leander et al. 2014). Northern Europe shows a (signiï¬cant) increase in R95pTOT, but this is far less pronounced for S95pTOT. Since R95pTOT cannot distinguish between a shift in the median of the probability distribution for precipitation and a change in only the tail of the distribution, trends are generally âmore negativeâ for S95pTOT, especially over southern Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Zolina et al. (2009) introduced a new index for R95pTOT, making use of a gamma distribution for wet day precipitation amounts and the associated theoretical distribution of the fractional contribution of the wettest days to the seasonal or annual total. The trend results for their new index are similar to R95pTOT. Another way of analysing changes in precipitation is by counting the number of wet days. An example of this is the index CWD (maximum number of consecutive wet days, here deï¬ned as the number of days with precipitation â¥1 mm).

For the ordinary Gumbel and Joe copulas, one has to choose one single parameter for all bivariate (and higher dimensional) dependencies. Therefore the estimation is always a trade-off between stronger and weaker dependencies. This leads to the effect that, in our example, the dependence in both cases seems to be rather underestimated by this copulas compared to its competitors. The HAC overcomes this drawback by using different parameters, which leads to a significantly better fit."

82,216,0.273,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"In (4.1) the importance of P(p) has somewhat decreased. It is still the case that it largely determines P(q), but the influence of the conditional probabilities has become greater. In general it is so that, as the chain becomes longer, the support provided by the totality of the conditional probabilities increases, while that given by the foundation decreases. In other words, as m in Am grows larger and larger, a law of diminishing returns come into force: the influence of P(p) on P(q) tapers off with each link, until it finally fades away completely. In the limit that m tends to infinity, all the probabilistic support for q comes from the conditional probabilities together, and none from the ground or foundation. This characteristic, that is essential to a probabilistic regress as we defined it, we call the feature of fading foundations. As we add more and more links to the chain the influence of P(p) tails off, and P(q) draws closer and closer to its final value. The feature of fading foundations can be illustrated by our story about Barbara bacterium in the previous chapter. Recall that q is the proposition âBarbara has trait T â, An is âBarbaraâs ancestor in the nth generation has T â, and p is âBarbaraâs primordial mother has T â. Now imagine that long and extensive empirical research in our laboratory has taught us that the probability that a bacterium has T is 0.99 when her mother has T , and that it is 0.04 when her mother lacks T :"

However, for a real practical use of this feature the tools for processing it are also needed. Of course some kind of quantitative processing is provided by the definitions of calculations, but there is much more potential for this feature apart from arithmetic operations. This part presents the idea of a property of processing data called sensitivity to the direction. The main focus here is placed on the proposition of a direction determinant parameter that can be understood as a kind of measure of a direction. This determinant is a basis for the definition of such elements as the compatibility between two OFNs and also for an inference operator for a rule where the OFNs were used. The propositions of such operations are the important part of these sections of the book."

A hindcast using geostrophic winds indicates another maximum to the south of Gotland (RÃ¤Ã¤met and Soomere 2010). This may be explained by large interannual and decadal variability in wind patterns over the area that naturally causes extensive variations in both average and extreme wave patterns. A very similar spatial pattern of heights to the one shown in Fig. 9.16 (left panel) is found for extreme waves (threshold of the 1 % or the 99th percentile of signiï¬cant wave height for each year) based on geostrophic winds (Soomere and RÃ¤Ã¤met 2011). The empirical distributions of the occurrence of different wave heights at offshore measurement sites (such as Almagrundet, BogskÃ¤r, the wave-rider in the northern Baltic Proper and at the Darss Sill) resemble a Rayleigh distribution, with typical values of the shape parameter of 1.5â1.8 (Soomere 2008; Soomere et al. 2011). The most frequent wave heights are usually in the range 0.5â0.75 m. Signiï¬cant wave heights greater than 4 m occur offshore with a probability of about 1 %, that is, during about 60 h per year. Signiï¬cant wave heights over 7 m have been measured, on average, about twice per decade in the northern Baltic Proper (Soomere 2008; Tuomi et al. 2011) and so can be considered extreme conditions. The wave climate is, however, highly intermittent and the sea occasionally experiences very high waves. The largest instrumentally measured values of signiï¬cant wave heights (Hs) are Hs = 8.2 m in the northern Baltic Proper on 22 December 2004 (Directional Waverider, Tuomi et al. 2011) and Hs = 7.82 m on 13/14 January 1984 at Almagrundet [upward-looking echo sounder; estimated from the 10th highest waves based on Rayleigh distribution; an alternative estimate from the wave spectrum is Hs = 7.28 m (Broman et al. 2006)]. The highest individual instrumentally measured waves were 14 and 12.75 m, respectively. Numerical simulations indicate that Hs may reach 9.5â10 m in the northeastern Baltic Proper at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, to the north-west of the Latvian coast and in the south-eastern part of the Gulf of Gdansk (Schmager et al. 2008; Soomere et al. 2008a; Tuomi et al. 2011). The properties of waves in a particular region and storm event depend on the match of the geometry of the sea area and the wind pattern of the storm (Augustin 2005; Soomere et al. 2008a; Schmager et al. 2008). Typical and extreme wave heights are much lower in subbasins of the Baltic Sea. A large proportion of the low waves (Hs < 0.25 m) for most of the coastal visual observation sites (except for Vilsandi) (Zaitseva-PÃ¤rnaste et al. 2009, 2011) resembles an analogous property of simulated distribution in semi-sheltered bays (Soomere 2005). The frequency of occurrence of waves with Hs > 4 m is very low for all subbasins except the Bothnian Sea (Tuomi et al. 2011) and waves with Hs > 2 m may be considered extreme for semi-"

Differences are thus likely to be subtle. Even though investigating differences in WM intra-hemispheric organization may seem complex, Iturria-Medina et al. (2011) have developed a promising approach, applying graph analyses to WM images obtained with DTI. The originality of this approach is that WM hemisphere graphs are computed after a virtual cut of the inter-hemispheric callosal connections, making it possible to unravel potential differences that were probably masked by the strength of existing callosal connections. Although the results were obtained in a limited sample of individuals, they evidenced hemispheric differences: the left hemisphere was hosting more nodes, whereas the right had more connections. Comparison of this observation to functional or behavioral observations will allow us to progress in understanding these hemispheric differences in WM connectivity."

Figure 6.4 illustrates the different shapes that the probability density function for a gamma variable can assume.

Unfortunately, its cumulative distribution function is not available in closed form, except for integer Î±, though it is available in many software packages including Microsoft Excel. The gamma family includes a very special case: the exponential distribution is obtained when Î± = 1. The gamma distribution has several generalizations (Bobee and Ashkar 1991).

84,620,0.271,Eye Tracking Methodology,"as a quadrilateral mesh, was divided into fixed-size (number of vertices) subblocks, allowing rendering for variable LOD on a per-subblock basis. From a fully detailed surface, lower levels of resolution were constructed by removing half of the vertices in each direction and assigning new vertex values. The new values were averages of the higher resolution values. Resolution level was chosen per sub-block, based on viewer distance. The resolution level was not discrete; it was interpolated between the precomputed discrete levels to avoid âpoppingâ effects. The terrain, prior to gaze-contingent alteration, is shown in Fig. 24.9. Rocks in the terrain are rendered by billboarding; i.e., images of rocks from the Pathfinder mission to Mars were rendered onto 2D transparent planes that rotate to maintain an orientation orthogonal to the viewer. Two views of the gaze-contingent environment (shown rendered and in wireframe) are seen in Figs. 24.10 and 24.11. To exaggerate the gaze-contingent effect, in this environment, fractal mountains appear and disappear from view, based on direction of gaze. Notice also, in Fig. 24.10a, b, the increased resolution (number of quads) below the gaze vector. The images in the figure are snapshots of the scene images generated by the eye tracker; i.e., what is seen by the operator (the point of regard crosshair, coordinates, and video frame timecode) is not seen by the viewer immersed in the environment. More recent work on gaze-contingent LOD modeling has been carried out by Luebke and Erikson (1997). The authors present a view-dependent LOD technique suitable for gaze-contingent rendering. Although simplification of individual geometric objects is discussed in their work, it appears the strategy is ultimately directed toward solving the interactive âwalkthroughâ problem (Funkhouser and SÃ©quin 1993). In this application, the view-dependent LOD technique seems more suitable to the (possibly) gaze-contingent rendering of an entire scene or environment. Recently, the authors have developed a gaze-directed LOD technique to facilitate the gaze-contingent display of geometric objects (Luebke et al. 2000). To test their rendering approach the authors employed a table-mounted monocular eye tracker to measure the viewerâs real-time location of gaze over a desktop display. This work shows the feasibility of employing an eye tracker, however the implementation framework used by the authors lacked a head tracker and required a chin rest to ensure tracker accuracy. A new object-based LOD method has been developed by Murphy and Duchowski (2001). The technique is similar to Luebke and Erikson and to Ohshima et al., where objects are modeled for gaze-contingent viewing. Unlike the approach of Ohshima et al., resolution degradation is applied nonisotropically; i.e., objects are not necessarily degraded uniformly. The spatial degradation function for LOD selection differs significantly from the area-based criterion originally proposed by Clarke. Instead of evaluating the screen coverage of the projected object, the degradation function is based on the evaluation of visual angle in world coordinates. System performance measurements are reported, obtained from experiments using a binocular eye tracker built into an HMD. Tracking software obtains helmet position and orientation in realtime and calculates the direction of the userâs gaze. The geometric modeling technique developed for the purpose of gaze-contingent rendering includes an integrated approach to tiling, mapping, and remeshing of closed surfaces. A three-dimensional"

In particular, the dependency function is of the form dep : V â V â . Example 6. The formalization of our example BN (Fig. 3) is straightforward. For instance, the dependencies of variable G are given by dep(G) = (D, P ) (assuming D is encoded by an integer less than P ). Furthermore, every entry in the conditional probability table of node G corresponds to an evaluation of the function cpt[G]. For example, if D = 1, P = 0, and G = 1, we have cpt[G](1, 0)(1) = 0.4. In general, the conditional probability table cpt determines the conditional probability distribution of each node v â V given the nodes and inputs it depends on. Formally, we interpret an entry in a conditional probability table as follows: Pr (v = a | dep(v) = z) = cpt[v](z)(a), where v â V is a node, a â Vals is a value, and z is a tuple of values of length |dep(v)|. Then, by the chain rule, the joint probability of a BN is given by the product of its conditional probability tables (cf. [4]). Definition 8. Let B = (V, I, E, Vals, dep, cpt) be an extended Bayesian network. Moreover, let W â V be a downward closed5 set of nodes. With each w â W âª I, we associate a fixed value w â Vals. This notation is lifted pointwise to tuples of nodes and inputs. Then the joint probability in which nodes in W assume values W is given by cpt[v](dep(v))(v).

32,52,0.271,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Social Modeling and Simulation, plus Econophysics Colloquium 2014","In Fig. 2.4 it is shown that the average TE across all equities is quite stable except for the drop occurring at the time of the change in minimum price increments on the 24th June. A simple shuffling test [14] estimates the TE for unrelated data to be approximately 0.02 nits on average (see the dashed lines, randomly sampled before and after the drop on day 61) but note that numerical estimations of TE are difficult so the TE sometimes drop below zero. This suggests that on average the TE across the DJIA is close to negligible but that some equities clearly have TE values significantly exceeding the 0.02 nits level, as shown by the blue line values. The largest peak in the Maximum TE plot occurs 6 days after the Dow crashes and is from the Disney equity to the McDonalds equity. Finally in Fig. 2.5 is plotted two networks of relationships between the equities based on Pearson correlations and TE. The Pearson correlation network is ordered counterclockwise according to the total link weight of each equity and a link was included if its correlation was greater than 0.4. The TE network is ordered counterclockwise by total link weight, the colour represents the total weight of incoming links and the node size represents the total weight of outgoing links and a link was included if its TE was greater than 0.05 nits. Thresholds were chosen such that 10 % of all links in each network are included. The most notable differences between these networks is the changes in the relative importance of the individual equities. The overall DJIA index (DJI) is significantly correlated with other equities whereas this index is the least significant node in the TE network. Similarly, Walmart (WMT) is very well connected in the TE network but it is the least relevant node in the Pearson correlation network. These are preliminary results using the comparatively small dataset of the 30 equities that make up the DJIA and will need to be confirmed on other indices and other crashes. There is one very significant point that comes out of this study: The driver of correlations between equities in financial markets is not necessarily the changes in the prices of other equities. This is true in the sense that changes in"

In a large-scale simulation study it is shown that the test performs well according to the error probability of the first kind and the power under several alternatives, especially in high dimensions where this test is (still) easy to apply. The test is compared to commonly applied tests for Archimedean copulas. However, these are usually numerically demanding (according to precision and runtime), especially when the dimension is large. The transformation underlying the newly proposed test was originally used for sampling random variates from Archimedean copulas. Its correctness is proven under weaker assumptions. It may be interpreted as an analogon to Rosenblattâs transformation which is linked to the conditional distribution method for sampling random variates. Furthermore, the suggested goodness-of-fit test complements a commonly used goodness-of-fit test based on the Kendall distribution function in the sense that it utilizes all other components of the transformation except the Kendall distribution function. Finally, a graphical test based on the proposed transformation is presented.

In this approach, detector measurements such as dE/dx, time-of-ï¬ight, calorimeter response, and muon detector response are combined by multiplying their likelihoods for a given particle type interpretation. Then rectangular cuts are applied to ratios of these likelihoods for diï¬erent particle hypotheses. This approach to combining the available information has the merits of ease of application and interpretation. It also has some motivation from the fact that the likelihood ratio provides a uniformly most powerful test in the case of simple hypotheses. Table 5.2.1 shows a comparison of âcut-basedâ (that is, making rectangular cuts on the basic detector quantities) and âlikelihood basedâ muon selection: for an eï¬ciency loss of less than 10%, the likelihood method decreases the pion contamination by approximately 30%.

This can be a diï¬culty with this approach if this information is not readily available. The âsupervised learningâ methods (neural networks and decision trees) described below have an advantage in this respect, because subtle features, including correlations, are usually included automatically in the training samples.

The azimuthal coordinate Ï is the angle of the transverse momentum vector with the x axis in BABAR while the coordinate Ï + Ï0 is the angle of the transverse momentum vector with the y axis in Belle.

Although the number of datasets in the distribution is quite small (36) we may, with good will, observe an approximation to a Bradford distribution for the searched records: the first tertile (69,207 records) of the total number of records (207,622) is covered by the top-2 1/2 datasets alone (sorted by Record Number = 79,273 records). The next 6 1/2 datasets cover 74,086 records, approximating the second tertile. The remaining 27 datasets cover the last tertile. This approximates to a = 2.5 datasets; a n = 2.5 Ã 3 (= 7 1/2 datasets) and a n2 = 2.5 Ã 9 (= 22 1/2 datasets). A Bradford distribution for a given range of datasets implies that very few datasets (2â3) cover a large portion (> 33 %) of the entire volume of records in the area covered by the range of datasets (here defined by the provider), followed by a long tail phenomenon. In fact, the pattern shown is steeper than suggested by a standard Bradford distribution. More than 2/3 of the searched records in the DanBIF biodiversity collection (142,000 records) were covered by only 7 datasets (20 %), Fig. 3, right-hand side. From Table 1 we observe that of the top-10 datasets ranked according to search events (popularity) seven datasets were also those sets with most used records as searched and viewed by peer biodiversity researchers world-wide. The pattern can be monitored over time for consistency, see example Table 2 for the HUA provider. During the monitored month in 2009 the DOF dataset was the most used set according to Searched Records but ranked fifth with respect to Searching Event frequency, i.e. popularity. In addition the DOF dataset had the highest Search Density (105.5 records per search event). Figure 4 displays the corresponding rank distribution of search events over the 36 DanBIF datasets during the same time slot, again providing a long tail distribution, but with two datasets standing out as most searched (popular) datasets.

32,643,0.267,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Social Modeling and Simulation, plus Econophysics Colloquium 2014","Around the middle of Fig. 28.6, we can see three nodes with larger degrees than others. Their colors are red, green, and yellow from left to right, respectively. These nodes are the hubs of the communities in the sense that they have the largest values of both in-degree Wiin and out-degree Wiout in each of their communities. It is interesting that those nodes for the red and yellow communities have the largest absolute values of the difference Ä±i D Wiout Wiin in each of their communities. We also note that all of the words corresponding to these three nodes are classified as positive in the dictionary of emotional words. In Table 28.1, we summarize these features of the community structure. These features mean the following. In each of the communities, there exists key emotional words. However, these words have different directions of influence. While the word âlikeâ in the red community is most influential to arouse emotion of others, the one âidolâ in the yellow community appears most under influence of other emotional words. In the green community, the word with the largest absolute value of the difference Ä±i is different from the one with the largest values of in-degree and outdegree. Moreover, the word with the largest absolute value of the difference in the green community is negative while the one with the largest in/out-degrees there is positive. Such differences in the three communities could imply how emotional exchanges differ among them. In order to see such differences in more detail, we show, in Table 28.2, a list of words with which the key emotional words have larger values of in-degrees/out-degrees. This table indicates how the key emotional words affect others or how they are used under influence of others within the same communities. In Table 28.2, for each of the three communities, three words are listed in the order of in-degree/out-degree which its key word has. For each of the word listed, we also show its order, its value of in-degree/out-degree, and its nature, i.e., positive or negative.

Also, of course, it is known that people are not particularly good about making sure that probabilities or percentages âadd upâ properly (see, e.g., JÃ¶nsson and Hampton 2006). Second, even if they were calibrating their estimates this ï¬nely, there is another effect that would seem to be a countervailing force: (Spalding and GagnÃ© 2015) found that when the property was not true enough of the head category, then there was no modiï¬cation effect. In short, the expectation of contrast depends on there being an initial expectation that the property either is or is not true of the unmodiï¬ed concept. When participants were told that some Xâs have property P, there was no modiï¬cation effect (nor was there an inverse modiï¬cation effect). Generally, of course, the existence of both the modiï¬cation effect and its inverse assumes that at some level of likelihood, there is a reversal of contrast expectation, and hence there are probably some levels of likelihood where there is no effect. In other words, as likelihood of a property decreases towards 50% or so, the modiï¬cation effect goes away, and then re-emerges as an inverse modiï¬cation effect as the likelihood of the property moves further toward 0%. Thus, even if participants were trying diligently to make their percentages add up properly, we should be unlikely to see the kind of interaction suggested above, as this change to expected contrast works in opposition to the interaction described in the earlier part of this paragraph."

Although all beaches along the Tamaulipas coast are prone to washover during storms, beach widths tend to decrease from the Rio Grande south and beach face slopes increase (Carranza-Edwards et al. 2007). Fine-grained terrigenous sands are dominant, with grain size increasing as beach slopes become steeper. Longshore sand transport for Padre Island beaches varies depending on shoreline orientation. Although literature indicates that net littoral transport along northern Padre Island is to the south, sedimentation at the Packery Channel jetties indicates a nearly symmetrical deposition pattern, suggesting variable transport direction (Figure 6.54). Because transport direction varies depending on season and year along this section of coast, net transport rates are relatively low (Williams et al. 2007).

When shoreline orientation shifts from southwest to southeast along central Padre Island, net northward transport is well illustrated at jettied entrances (Figure 6.56). Heilman and Kraus (1996) calculated average net longshore transport rates along South Padre Island to be about 115,000 m3/year (150,000 cy/year) to the north. South of the Rio Grande, along the deltaic headland beach of Barra El Conchillal, net transport direction shifts southward based on shoreline orientation and dominant wave climate. This pattern of transport continues south to La Pesca. Although no information is available on net transport rates for beaches fronting the Tamaulipas Laguna Madre, deposition patterns at jettied entrances document the net direction of longshore transport (Figure 6.57). Between Packery Channel and Mansfield Channel, a longshore sand transport convergence zone shifts north and south depending on annual variation in wave energy relative to shoreline orientation. As such, a 38-km (24-mi) section of beach along north central Padre Island illustrates net accretion (~0.1 m/year [0.3 ft/year]) since 1937 (Figure 6.55). Conversely, the 20-km (12-mi) shoreline segment to the north toward Packery Channel and the 53-km (33-mi) segment south toward Mansfield Channel recorded net shoreline recession of about 1.0 m/year (3.3 ft/year) and 0.9 m/year (3.0 ft/year), respectively. The shoreline recession rate increased substantially for the 7-km (4.3-mi) segment north of Mansfield channel to about 4.1 m/year (13.5 ft/year), perhaps due to interruption of north-directed longshore sediment transport by the jetties at Mansfield Channel entrance. South of the channel, sand deposition within 1.5 km (0.9 mi) of the south jetty resulted in beach accretion and shoreline advance of about 1.9 m/year (6.2 ft/year). However, south of this deposition zone for approximately 50 km (31 mi), shoreline recession was prevalent at an average rate of about 3.1 m/year (10.2 ft/year). Only the southern 5 km (3.1 mi) of beach fronting South Padre Island was net depositional (1.6 m/year [5.2 ft/ year]), likely the result of beach nourishment. South of Brazos Santiago Pass, the coast was net depositional during the Holocene as fluvial sediment from the Rio Grande supplied sand to form barrier islands (Paine et al. 2011). Since 1937, the northern 4.5 km (2.8 mi) of beach recorded net deposition from north-directed longshore sand transport, resulting in average shoreline advance of 0.8 m/year (2.6 ft/year). Conversely, the southern 7.5 km (4.8 mi) of beach to the Rio Grande documented shoreline recession of about 2.9 m/year (9.5 ft/year)."

The demand curve (D) shown in black depicts the relationship between the price for maize and the quantity of maize consumers are willing and able to buy at each particular price whereâaccording to the law of demandâthe quantity demanded depends negatively on the price. This normal, negative demand reaction to price increases is the result of two separate effects: (1) If the maize price increases, the consumer can afford less quantity of maize at the given income and thus demands less. This is the income effect. (2) When the price of maize increases, the consumer will look for alternative products similarly satisfying the need and thus substitute some of the consumption of maize, for instance, with wheat. This is the substitution effect. Both effects will cause the consumer to buy less maize if its price increases, so that the total quantity of maize demanded will decrease. Usually, a demand curve in a market reflects the aggregate demand of all consumers in the market. In Fig. 8.9 we assume that consumer 1 (blue curve) represents the maize demand by food and feed producers, whereas consumer 2 (green curve) represents the maize demand by producers of for example biofuels and bioplastics.

Therefore, in sea states with shorter peak periods, 6â10 s, the slowly-varying drift force may excite large resonant surge motions, while in a sea state with a long peak period around 20 s the motion is dominated by the wave-frequency motion and the overall damping is larger preventing resonant motion. How to choose sea states along the contour line is indicated in Fig. 7.2. The same values for wind and current shall be applied together with all the sea states chosen along the 100-year contour. If it is not possible to develop a contour line due to limited environmental data for a location a sensitivity analysis with respect to the peak period for the 100 year sea state shall be carried out. The range of wave steepness criteria deï¬ned in DNV-RP-C205 [9] (Paragraph 3.5.5) can then be applied to indicate a suitable range of peak wave periods to be considered in the sensitivity analysis.

80,791,0.262,Innovations in Quantitative Risk Management (Volume 99.0),"4 Robust Risk Aggregation via Bounds on Integrals In quantitative risk management, distributions are often estimated within a parametric family from the available data. For example, the tails of marginal distributions may be estimated via extreme value theory, or a Gaussian copula may be fitted to the multivariate distribution of all risks under consideration, to model their dependencies. The choice of a parametric family introduces model uncertainty, while fitting a distribution from this family via statistical estimation introduces parameter uncertainty. In both cases, a more robust alternative would be to study models in which the available data is only used to estimate upper and lower bounds on finitely many integrals of the form"

After the collection of wind speed data, an annual excess probability distribution can be evaluated by using wind data based on plotting position formula. The strong wind hazard curves were developed using the Gumbel and Weibull distributions, of which parameters were calculated by a least square method. Figure 9.3 shows the hazard curves based on the Gumbel and Weibull distributions. In the Gumbel distribution, the estimated curve decreases linearly less than 0.1 of the annual excess probability. In the Weibull distribution, on the other hand, the curve decreases like a quadratic curve.

84,379,0.261,Eye Tracking Methodology,"Note that a uniform grid is not a necessity. The transition matrix can be composed from arbitrarily defined AOIs. For example, Ellis and Stark (1986) compared transition matrices of airline pilots viewing a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information or CDTI. The CDTI was fixed with 8 AOIs. Krejtz et al. (2015) provide other examples. How to interpret the meaning of Ht ? Weiss et al. (1989) note that in a transition matrix, a small Ht suggests dependencies between the fixation points, whereas a large Ht suggests a random scanning pattern. Stated another way, entropy refers to the âexpected surpriseâ of a given gaze transition. Minimum entropy of 0 suggests no expected surprise, meaning that a gaze transition is always expected to the same jth AOI. Maximum entropy, on the other hand, suggests maximum surprise, since transition from source AOI to any destination AOI is equally likely, and hence whichever occurs results in maximum expected surprise. More formally, the term â pi j log2 pi j in (14.16) is the transitionâs contribution to system entropy, modeled by its probability multiplied by its surprisal (Hume and Mailhot 2013). The key difference between Krejtz et al. (2015) approach and that of Ellis and Stark (1986) is that Krejtz et al. consider self-transitions. The use of a grid also makes the transition matrix analysis content-independent. The benefit of contentindependence is that it allows estimation of transition matrices irrespective of the expected AOIs in the scene. All that is required is knowledge of the dimensions of the screen to establish different grid granularities. This makes the statistical analysis portable among different experimental designs. Krejtz et al. (2015) compute a transition matrix by setting matrix elements pi j to the number of transitions from the ith source AOI to the jth destination AOI for each participant. The matrix is then normalized relative to each source AOI (i.e., per row). In practice, it is possible that no transitions from the ith AOI are observed. This leads to a zero matrix row sum and division by zero. When this occurs, each of the row entries is set to their uniform transition distribution, namely pi j = 1/s, where s is the number of AOIs, thereby modeling an equally likely probability of transitioning to any other AOI given this ith source AOI (hence maximum âsurpriseâ). The benefit of this implementation decision is that it leads to the construction of a transition matrix that is regular (specifically a right stochastic matrix), with all entries positive and non-zero, facilitating stationary entropy calculation via Eigen analysis. Note that setting each of the pi j entries to 1/s would lead to a uniform matrix with maximum entropy equal to log2 s bits per transition. Indeed, maximum entropy is used to normalize the empirical entropy obtained from each transition matrix. That is, statistical comparison of mean entropies per experimental condition is facilitated by computing Ht per individual participant and per condition, then normalizing, HÌt = Ht / log2 s. This results in a table of entropies (each entropy computed from an individualâs transition matrix) for each of experimental conditions and each of the participants. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is then used to test for differences in mean (normalized) entropy per condition. An example of entropy analysis is given in Chap. 15."

If the total area is given a value of 1, then the area under each part of the curve is the fractional chance that an event exceeding some threshold will occur. In Fig. 1.1, the area to the right of point T1 is the probability that the temperature will be greater than T1, which might be about 20 % of the curve. The mean, or expected value, is the weighted average of the points. It need not be the point with the highest frequency. The mean value is the point at which half the probability (50 %) is on one side of the mean, and half on the other. The median is the value at which half the points are on one side and half on the other. Here is an important and obvious question: How can we predict the climate (for next season, next year, or 50 years from now) if we cannot predict the weather (in 5 or 10 days)? The answer is, we use probability: The climate is the distribution of probable weather. The weather is a particular location in that distribution, and it is conditional on the current state of the system. The chance of a hurricane hitting Miami next week depends mostly on whether one has formed or is forming, and if one has formed, whether it is heading in the direction of Miami. As another example, the chance of having a rainy day in Seattle in January is high. But, given a particular day in January, with a weather state that might be pushing storms well to the north or south, the probability of rain the next day might be very low. In 50 Januaries, though, the probability of rain would be high. So climate is the distribution of weather (sometimes unknown). Weather is a given state in that distribution (often uncertain). In a probability distribution of climate, the probabilities and the curve change over time: In the middle latitudes, the chance of snow is higher in winter than in summer. The curves will look different from place to place: Some climates have narrow distributions (see Fig. 1.2a), which means the weather is often very close to the average. Think about Hawaii, where the average of the daily highs and lows do not change much over the course of the year or Alaska, where the daily highs and lows may be the same as in Hawaii in summer, but not in winter. For Alaska the annual distribution of temperature is a very broad distribution (more like Fig. 1.2b)."

311,1690,0.26,The Physics of the B Factories,"The spectra of M (D(â) D(â) ) â¡ Mrecoil (J/Ï ) are shown in Figs 18.2.9 (a), (b), (c), and (d) for the four selected cases in turn. Enhancements near threshold are evident in each distribution. A fit to the M (DD) distribution finds a broad resonance-like structure near the threshold, tentatively denoted X(3880). However the significance of the broad peak is low (3.8 Ï), and the fit is not stable under variation of the background parameterization. Therefore, with the existing sample the resonant structure in this process cannot be reliably determined. The significance of the X(3940) signal found by the fit to the M (DDâ ) spectrum is 5.7 Ï (including systematic uncertainties). The X(3940) mass and width are M = (3942 + â 6 Â± 6) MeV/c + 26 and Î = (37 â 15 Â± 8) MeV. The insets in Figs 18.2.9 (a) and (b) show the background subtracted spectra with the signal functions superimposed. The M (Dâ Dâ ) spectrum has a clear broad enhancement near threshold, which is seen above the small combinatorial background and the X(3940) reflection. The observed enhancement, which has a significance of 5.1 Ï (including systematics), was interpreted as a new resonance and denoted X(4160). The X(4160) parameters + 111 are M = (4156 + â 20 Â± 15) MeV/c and Î = (139 â 61 Â± 21) MeV.

82,143,0.26,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"In this passage, Alston is criticizing the standard probability calculus on two points. First, in order for the ground A j to be adequate (or relevant) for the target Ai , A j must render Ai more or less probable. But if Ai is a necessary truth or falsehood, then standard probability implies that A j will not render Ai more or less probable. Thus A j will not be adequate or relevant to Ai , and this is counterintuitive. Second, whether A j renders Ai more or less probable, and thus whether A j is (ir)relevant to Ai , will have to be determined outside the probability calculus, and this is troublesome. What to make of these two points? Letâs begin with the first one. We will follow Alston in describing an adequate or relevant ground as one that makes the target more of less probable; this in fact sits well with our condition of probabilistic support. Alston is right that in standard probability theory, if the target Ai is a tautology or a contradiction, then the ground A j will not render Ai more or less probable, and will in that sense be irrelevant to the target. But why call this counterintuitive or otherwise problematic? It would be stranger, and even inconsistent, if something that already had the maximum probability value would acquire an even higher one. Moreover, calling Ai a tautology or a contradiction (necessary truth or falsehood) already presuposes a system in which Ai has that character. That is, if Ai is 2 + 2 = 4, then Ai is a tautology relative to any system equivalent to the axioms of arithmetic. So if A j is such a system, then P(Ai |A j ) = 1. The situation remains the same if we add to A j the proposition that all crows are black: P(Ai |A j and all crows are black) = 1. What if the ground A j consists 81 Ibid., 97-98."

If the beam has elongated contours and width comparable to the source under observation, rotation of the beam causes the effective intensity distribution to vary with hour angle.

For the Australia Pathfinder Array (DeBoer et al. 2009), the 12-m-diameter antennas have altazimuth mounts, with a third axis that allows the reflector, feed supports, and feeds to be rotated about the reflector axis so the beam pattern and the angle of polarization remain fixed relative to the sky."

65,130,0.259,Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy,"Diffraction occurs when waves meet a surface-piercing obstacle such as an island, headland or breakwater. Without diffraction the waves would continue to travel in the same direction leaving a region of calm water in the lee of the obstacle. However, diffraction means that the waves will bend so that there are waves behind the obstacle. The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength, with the longer waves diffracting to a greater extent than the shorter waves. If there is more than one source of diffraction, e.g. either side of an island, then a diffraction pattern may form where there are areas of increased and decreased wave height due to constructive and destructive interference. Although diffraction means that waves will occur on the leeward side of an obstacle, generally these waves will be smaller than the incident waves (except in the special case of constructive interference) so the wave resource behind an obstacle, is likely to be smaller than the seaward wave resource."

Fossett and South (1983:861) note that the value of ND, and therefore G, can be obtained from the following computing formula ND = G = Î£ i Î£ j x â ( w i W ) ( b j B) where i and j index areas ranked on area proportion White (p), and x is scored: 1 if ( i > j ), 0 if ( i = j ), and â1 if ( i < j ). This formula highlights that G responds solely to White-Black comparisons on rank order standing on area proportion White (p). Thus, it gives insight into why G is insensitive to the quantitative magnitude of group differences on p; G treats all White-Black differences on p as either 1 or â1, regardless of the difference involved is large or small. Fossett and Siebert (1997, Appendix A) also explore the formulation of G as a measure of inter-group inequality on ranked outcomes. They showed that G is a special case of Somersâ dyx, a measure of ordinal (rank-order) association. Consequently, G can be interpreted as an ordinal slope coefficient that indicates the impact of race (i.e., group membership) on the rank order standing of individuals on residential contact with Whites (p). Of more direct relevance for the present discussion, Fossett and Siebert also noted that the value of G can be given as twice the difference of group means on percentile (or quantile) scores for ranked outcomes. In application to White-Black segregation this means that G registers the White-Black difference of means on quantile scores for contact with Whites (p)."

Recent molecular data suggest that this separation may be correlated with a higher expression level of layer-4 markers in D2 (Dugas-ford et al. 2012). Confirmation of this division and of its potential functional significance needs additional work. Such gradients of connectivity across the cortical surface (in PCx and DCx) should be clearly described because any horizontal heterogeneity could influence the propagation and reverberation of activity across cortex, under the combined influences of spreading afferent input and widespread associational activity. Given their reciprocal interconnections with high-order cortical areas and a lack of evident sensory topography, PCx and DCx are sometime described as associational rather than primary sensory cortices (Shepherd 2011). The major partners of PCx are the orbitofrontal cortex (Ekstrand et al. 2001; Illig 2006), the lateral entorhinal cortex (Kerr et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2000) and the agranular insular cortex (Johnson et al. 2000). Connectivity to these downstream targets differs between aPCx and pPCx, supporting the notion that they have different functions. Similarly, DCx is reciprocally connected to dorso-medial (DMCx) and medial (MCx) cortices (Ulinski 1977; Desan 1984). Those regions are, on the basis of hodology and position, often compared to parahippocampal and hippocampal opez et al. 2003; Aboitiz et al. 2003). cortices (Desan 1984; Northcutt 1981; L Both PCx and DCx are thus directly connected to associational networks likely involved in controlling or modulating behavior. PCx and DCx are further interconnected with other cortical-like areas that also receive parallel sensory afferents from the OB or the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN), respectively. For PCx, these include the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON; Haberly and Price 1978; Illig and Eudy 2009), the olfactory tubercule (OT; Haberly and Price 1978), and the amygdala (Johnson et al. 2000; Luna and Morozov 2012). AON might be a first stage of odorant-feature processing, in turn used by PCx to detect complex odorant combinations (Haberly 2001; Lei et al. 2006; Kay et al. 2011). DCxâs AON equivalent could be the pallial thickening (PT), for it receives direct thalamic afferent input and projects to DCx (Mulligan and Ulinski 1990; Heller and Ulinski 1987). If AON and PT also share functional characteristics, these similarities may point to common elementary processing streams of three-layered sensory cortices. In turtles, visual stimulation triggers propagating waves of neural activity that travel across the cortex. These waves are slower and simpler than those observed in mammalian neocortex. They are accompanied by relatively slow oscillations, which are most prominent in the 20 Hz frequency band. Whereas the so-called gamma oscillations in mammalian cortex are typically around and above 40 Hz, recent results in mice indicate that the 20 Hz band dominates when parvalbumin (PV) interneuron development is artificially arrested, consistent with the above observation that turtle cortex lacks PV interneurons. The computational role, if any, of such dynamics is unknown at present. Progress will require new experimental approaches that allow the simultaneous sampling of large neuronal populations. Specific and data-driven theories of computation in reptilian cortex thus await further study. To the extent that modern reptilian cortex resembles that in the"

The lowerright cell (B) âDisplacement without Separationâ involves a high level of group inequality on rank order position on area proportion White (p) but a low level of group inequality on quantitative differences on area proportion White (p). The combination indicates that Whites are consistently ranked above Blacks on area proportion White â as indicated by the high value of D, but the quantitative differences involved are small and thus result in the low value of S. Thus, the rank-order differences on area proportion White do not translate into group separation because the two groups have similar distributions on area racial composition (p) and thus the two populations are living together, not apart from each other."

365,139,0.256,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"where the BWI is the percentage of the surface that is liquid water (Basist et al. 2001), ÎÎµ, is empirically determined from global SSM/I measurements, Ts is surface temperature from station measurements, Tb is the satellite brightness temperature at a particular frequency (GHz), Ïn (n = 1, 2, 3) is a frequency observed by the SSM/I instrument, Î²0 and Î²1 are estimated coefficients that correlate the relationship of the various channel measurements with observed in situ surface temperature at the time of the satellite overpass. Specifically, as wetness values increase, the differences between the observed surface temperature and the observed channel measurements also increase (Williams et al. 2000). Weekly and monthly average BWI values are very good indicators of the magnitude of water near the surface, which has a relationship to water at greater depths. These observations have proven valuable in agricultural monitoring during the previous 25 years of analytical work. The wetness anomalies have proven valuable in predicting agricultural yields in many areas of the world (Curt Reynold USDA, personal correspondence). Research indicates the wetness product has a gamma distribution, much like precipitation (Gutman 1999); therefore a gamma distribution is used to derive the variation of wetness from the expected value. Since most regions of the world have annual cycles associated with their liquid water near the surface, it is best to calculate anomalies for each pixel, location and time of year. The resolution of the pixel is 33 km by 33 km, and anomalies are calculated on a monthly and weekly basis. A value of 0.01 means that only 1 year in a 100 would realize a value so low (extremely dry) at the location for a particular time of year. Conversely, a value of 0.99 corresponds with an excessively wet event that only occurs one out of a 100 years. In summary, values progressively less than 0.5 indicate increasingly drier conditions and values progressively greater than 0.5 indicate increasingly wetter conditions than the expected value (Fig. 1). The period of record for these wetness and temperature products begins in 1988 and they have been maintained in near real time for decades.1 There is a period of 2 years, 1990 and 1991, when the stability of the microwave satellite instrument was deemed unreliable. Therefore, these 2 years are removed from the analysis. The climatology we use is based on the 23 years of data from 1988 to 2010. A series of operational satellite instruments flown by the United States Meteorological Satellite Service comprise the period of observations. Great effort has been made to seam the observations between the various satellite instruments into one contiguous record. A daily set of observations is composed of 14 orbits across the globe. These observations are sun synchronous over the equator, at an overpass time around 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day. The morning and afternoon overpasses are processed independently and then combined together into one set of observations across the globe. Each set of observations is added to this record in near real-time, as both weekly and monthly fields of temperature and wetness values."

The number of SLM technologies is thus a count variable (ranging from 0 to 6 in our case). Thus the assessment of the determinants number of SLM technologies adopted requires models that accounts for count variables. Poisson regression model (PRM) is typically the initial step for most count data analyses (Areal et al. 2008). PRM is preferred because it takes considers the non-negative and binary nature of the data (Winkelmann and Zimmermann 1995). The assumption of equality of the variance and conditional mean in PRM also accounts for the inherent heteroscedasticity and skewed distribution of nonnegative data (ibid). PRM is further preferred because the log-linear model allows for treatment of zeros (ibid). The reduced form of the Poisson regression is presented as follows:

First, the condition is quite weak. It only says that Ai is made more probable by A j than by Â¬A j . It does not say that Ai is made more probable by A j than by another proposition Ak , nor does it claim anything about propositions different from Ai that are made even more probable by A j . Our condition is silent about the amount of probabilistic support that Ai receives from A j as compared to the amount of probabilistic support that Ai would have received from another proposition Ak . So the condition does not imply that the former amount is greater than the latter, nor does it imply that the amount of probabilistic support given to Ai should exceed a particular threshold.40 Second, the condition of probabilistic support is not a measure. As Branden Fitelson has emphasized, there are many different measures of probabilistic support or confirmation, and they are often ordinally inequivalent to one another.41 This might be problematic in many contexts, but it is not an issue for us. For the various measures of probabilistic support all agree in stating that A j probabilistically supports Ai if and only if P(Ai |A j ) > P(Ai |Â¬A j ), and this is all we need here. Third, the condition does not need a threshold. It could reasonably be objected that the phrase âmaking probableâ involves more than âmaking more probableâ. If A j makes Ai probable, then surely the effect of A j on Ai must be not merely to raise the probability of Ai , but also to raise it above one half (or perhaps above some agreed-upon threshold greater than a half). In Section 6.5 we shall say some more about thresholds, but the chief thing to realize is that a threshold condition is not needed for our purpose: a threshold is not required for finding out to what extent infinite justificatory chains make 39 From the definition of conditional probability it follows that"

337,350,0.25,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"of the property of actor location within a social network, with the most important actors being located in the most strategic locations within the network. Thus, an actorâs role is characterized by its structural position within the network (Borgatti and Foster 2003). Actor centrality is the measure typically employed for quantifying an actorâs role within a social network. A central actor is an actor with many ties to other actors within a network. Bodin et al. (2006) note that a network actor with a high degree of centrality can effectively coordinate actors within the network during times of change. Burt (2003) characterizes these actors as âbrokersâ within social networks. In social networks the policy sphere, this means policies can be passed through a legislature more quickly, but Abrahamson and Rosenkopf (1997) contend this leads to centralized decision making within the network. Another implication is that actors within the network will have more limited access to other sources of information (Weimann 1982). Another key structural feature of social networks is density within the network. Density within SNA is a quantifiable measure of connectivity between actors within the network and of the connectivity of the network as a whole. Density is not used as a measure of centrality per se; rather, it is a measure of the networkâs cohesion â the number of links between actors within the whole network, not on an individual basis as with centrality (Wasserman and Faust 1997). Density of a network is calculated by dividing the number of links by the number of nodes within the network. One of the structural characteristics of dense social networks is a buffering capacity referred to as redundancy (Bodin et al. 2006). In dense networks, if an actor is removed from the network, because of the many links between other actors within the network, the loss does not have as profound an effect on the overall network structure. For advocacy coalitions, this means even if a central actors is removed from the coalition, other actors can step into the position and assume the functions of the central actor (Folke et al. 2005). Social networks with greater connectivity of knowing each other exhibit higher levels of trust among actors within the network (Granovetter 1985). Pretty and Ward (2001) theorize that greater network density increases the possibility of social control of the actors within the network, which facilitates top-down regulation of the environment by the state. Oh et al. (2004) caution that dense networks can streamline policy processes, but may also promote homogenization of both experience and knowledge. Moreover, Frank and Yasumoto (1998) caution that too many links between actors within a social network can lock certain actors into inflexible positions, making political change difficult. A concluding example of a structural feature of social networks is modularity or betweenness. Betweenness can be measured within a social network by quantifying the distance between nodes within a network. In any given social network, groups with high internal density may be loosely connected to other groups with high internal density. This phenomenon is termed modularity, and describes groupings of actors within a social network (Bodin et al. 2006). Within a civil society, this can be characterized by businesses having dense ties to one another, but weak or peripheral ties to government ministries or environmental NGOs. The betweenness of actors"

Once calculated, the goal strengths are turned into a Boltzmann distribution (as discussed earlier) and the new goal is chosen stochastically from that distribution. For another instance, the processing mode module determines the probability of each component (a level or a component within) for the integration of outcomes from the two levels of the ACS (see the discussion of the ACS earlier). These probabilities may be determined through the notion of âprobability matchingâ: the probability of selecting a component is determined based on the relative success ratio of that component (see [45, 50] for details). However, these probabilities may be modulated multiplicatively by another parameter: the strength of avoidance-oriented primary drives (which corresponds to âanxietyâ [65, 66]; see more details below)."

The p.d.f. normalization can then be calculated by combining these cached terms and the current values of the complex coeï¬cients at each iteration of the ï¬t. Consequently, it is a common procedure to ï¬x the resonance parameters in the ï¬t. Where necessary, likelihood scans are used to determine the values of any less well-known parameters. Due to the complexity of the likelihood function and the large numbers of parameters involved in Dalitz-plot ï¬ts it is quite common for several local minima to appear in the parameter space. This can cause problems for the minimization routine in ï¬nding the global minimum. In addition, these local minima can be almost degenerate with the global minimum, leading to the need to quote multiple solutions. This can occur, for example, when ambiguities arise from broad overlapping states. The data can often be well described by two or more conï¬gurations of the magnitudes and phases of these states. The problem of ï¬nding the global minimum is usually overcome by performing multiple ï¬ts to a given data sample, each with diï¬erent (often randomized) starting values for the various parameters. One can then choose the case where the best likelihood was obtained as the global solution. This method also permits the exploration of the other local minima, which allows the results from other solutions to be quoted if they are not signiï¬cantly separated in likelihood from the global minimum. 13.4.4 Fit fractions The choice of normalization, phase convention, and amplitude formalism may not always be the same for different experiments or indeed among the diï¬erent ï¬tting packages used within a single experiment. Consequently, it is extremely important to provide as much conventionindependent information as possible to allow a more meaningful comparison of results. Fit fractions are quite commonly used, both for this purpose and for providing a means to estimate the branching fractions of the various decay modes involved. The ï¬t fraction for a component j is deï¬ned as the integral of the square of the decay amplitude for that component divided by the integral of the square of the entire matrix element over the Dalitz plot: |cj Aj (m)| dm FF j = !!

As noted earlier, this is usually the center or nominal position of the source to be imaged. The modulus and phase of V are equal to the amplitude and phase of the fringes; the phase is measured relative to the fringe phase for the hypothetical source. As defined above, V has the dimensions of flux density (W m!2 Hz!1 ), which is consistent with its Fourier transform relationship with I. Some authors have defined visibility as a normalized, dimensionless quantity, in which case it is necessary to reintroduce the intensity scale in the resulting image.

The spawning stock biomass of the western Atlantic bluefin tuna has declined substantially over the past few decades and is at a very low level despite more than 20 years of strict regulations on the western Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery (NMFS 2012b). Large uncertainty is associated with the most recent Atlantic bluefin tuna stock assessment, in particular with the estimated recruitment. The status of the population and fishery are dependent on the assumptions made on recruitment dynamics. For the high productivity scenario, the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock is considered overfished (e.g., population level is too low) and the fishery is in the status of overfishing (e.g., fishing mortality is too high) (Table 9.17) (NMFS 2012a). However, for the low productivity scenario, the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock is not overfished and the fishery is not in the status of overfishing (NMFS 2012a). Because of the limited information available, it is not clear which scenario more realistically describes the dynamics of Atlantic bluefin tuna recruitment. Despite the uncertainty in the stock assessment, the stock biomass of the western Atlantic bluefin tuna has decreased greatly since the 1970s, mainly as a result of overfishing (NMFS 2012a). Overfishing over the last several decades has greatly reduced the spawning stock biomass and stock reproductive potential, likely resulting in poor recruitment and current low stock biomass of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. However, the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock appears to be stable or even slightly increasing over the last 10 years, perhaps resulting from conservation measures and regulations (NMFS 2012a)."

Note, however, that apart from these rare individuals having reverse language lateralization, occurring with similar proportions in children and adults, handedness has no influence on the maturational increase of leftward asymmetries for language (Szaflarski et al. 2011). The fact that dissociations have been observed between the lateralization of language areas involved during language production and those involved in language perception suggests that there are different factors related to specific aspects of speech processing. In favor of this hypothesis is the evidence that anatomical factors explain a part of the variability of anatomical or functional lateralization of speech processing areas. Among them, brain volume determines inter-hemispheric distance and transfer time. According to Ringo et al. (1994), brain volume constrains high-speed processes to intra-hemispheric clustering in bulky brains. This theory fits within the framework of perceptual theories of the origin of language lateralization postulating that it arises from speed constraints on speech perception. As a matter of fact, we found positive correlations between brain volume and both leftward functional asymmetry during speech perception (Josse et al. 2006; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. 2010a) and leftward gray matter hemispheric asymmetry (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. 2010b). These results support Ringoâs theory of a âmechanicalâ impact of brain volume on speech lateralization. Other arguments come from the fact that anatomical characteristics of the auditory cortices explain a part of the functional variability in language lateralization, as, for example, the positive correlation between the left PT surface area and lateralization of activations during story listening (Tzourio et al. 1998; Josse et al. 2003). The picture is likely to be even more complex, given that factors can interact. For example, in right-handers, we showed that weaker manual lateralization decreases leftward lateralization for language only in individuals with familial sinistrality (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. 2010a). Moreover, factors that influence variability in HS, such as gender and brain volume, may also be partially confounded (Leonard et al. 2008). Finally, it must be emphasized that, although much is known about HS for language, the factors that might influence right hemisphere specialization remain to be discovered."

In particular, high values of the dissimilarity index (D), the most widely used segregation index, do not and intrinsically cannot provide a reliable signal about the presence of prototypical segregation.3 In contrast, high values of the separation index (S) provide a certain indication that a high level of prototypical segregation is present. The outcome of high displacement but with low separation â that is, high D and low S â occurs when residential distributions are characterized by âdispersed displacement.â In the pattern of dispersed displacement, individuals residing in nonparity areas are not concentrated in areas where their group predominates. Instead, the residential distribution for at least one of the groups â usually the smaller of the two groups, which in White-Minority comparisons in US cities is typically, but not always, the non-White minority group â is dispersed widely and thinly across nonparity areas such that most members of the group live in âmixedâ areas where their group is not the predominant presence. Indeed, it can be the case that few members of the group live in areas where their group is a majority presence and instead most members of the group live in areas where the other group in the comparison is the predominant group. As a result, under dispersed displacement the two groups in the comparison live together in areas with similar racial composition, not apart from each other in areas where racial composition is polarized."
231,1179,0.249,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"French scientists from IFREMER have used a delta GAM/GLM approach to model future plaice and red mullet distribution in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea (see Vaz and Loots 2009). Abundance of each species was related to depth, sediment type, bottom salinity and temperature. Results suggested that climate change may strongly affect the future distribution of plaice. For large plaice (>18 cm), distribution will still be centred in the southern part of the North Sea, however for young individuals, the predicted distribution is anticipated to shift north-westwards and to the Dogger Bank area in particular (as has already been observed, see van Keeken et al. 2007; Engelhard et al. 2011). Model outputs indicate that the distribution of red mullet will not change dramatically but that for young individuals (deï¬ned as <17.3 cm), the offshore habitat situated on the Dogger Bank may become increasingly favourable. Older individuals seemed little affected by the simulated change in environment, but they may beneï¬t from higher juvenile survival and expand their area of occupation as a result. There are some concerns about the validity of the bioclimate envelope approach for predicting the future distribution of commercially important ï¬sh species (see Jennings and Brander 2010; Heath et al. 2012). First, it may not be possible to assess temperature preferences from current distributions because the observed distributions are modiï¬ed by abundance, habitat, predator and prey abundance and competition. Second, there may be barriers to dispersal (although this is typically less of an issue in the sea than on land) and species will move at different rates and encounter different local ecologies as temperature changes (Davis et al. 1998). A more detailed, physiologically-based approach has been taken by some authors, whereby the detailed dynamics of individual animals are modelled, often by linking complex biophysical models (forced with the output from Global Climate Models) to sub-routines which replicate the behaviour/characteristics of eggs, larvae, juveniles or adults. Teal et al. (2008) reported a study of plaice and sole distribution in the North Sea, in which they predicted size- and season-speciï¬c ï¬sh distributions based on the physiology of the species, temperature and food conditions in the sea. This study combined state-of-the-art dynamic energy budget (DEB) models with output from a biogeochemical ecosystem model (ERSEM) forced with observed climatic data for 1989 and 2002, with contrasting temperature and food conditions. The resulting habitat quality maps were in broad agreement with observed ontogenetic and seasonal changes in distribution as well as with long-term observed changes in distribution. The technique has recently been extended to provide future projections up to year 2050, assuming moderate climate warming (L. Teal, pers. comm. IMARES, Netherlands)."

This feature implies that in an infinite chain the justification of the target arises exclusively from the joint intermediate links; a foundation or ground is not needed. The phenomenon of fading foundations sheds light on the difference between propositional and doxastic justification, and it helps us settle the question whether justification is transmitted from one link in the chain to another, as foundationalists claim, or whether it emerges from a chain or network as a whole, as is maintained by coherentists and infinitists."

70,579,0.248,Optics in Our Time,"Under most normal viewing conditions, the quality of the retinal images is governed by the wave-like nature of the light. The functions used to describe the quality of any optical instrument are showed in . Fig. 12.3 . The wave-aberration function is deï¬ned as the difference between the perfect (spherical) and the real wave-front for every point over the pupil. It is commonly represented as a two-dimensional map, where color level represents the amount of waveaberration, expressed either in microns. The image of a point source is called the point-spread function, PSF. An eye without aberrations has a constant, or null, wave-aberration and forms a perfect retinal image of a point source that depends only on the pupil diameter. By performing a convolution operation, it is possible to predict the retinal images of any object. This can be easily understood as placing a weighted PSF onto each point of the geometrical image. Readers interested in more information on the nature of light and/or the functions describing image quality could read some general optics references [1â3]."

This property of the phase closure relationships was first recognized and used by Jennison (1958). If a point source is observed, then the visibility phases are all zero, and, in the absence of receiver noise, the closure phase is also zero. Note that p if the rms phase noise on each baseline is $, the rms noise in the closure phase is 3$. To help visualize the phase closure concept, consider three stations of an array observing a point source, as shown in Fig. 10.7.

In considering functions in one dimension in the earlier part of this chapter, it was possible to define l in Eq. (2.3) as the sine of an angle. In two-dimensional analysis, l and m are defined as the cosines of the angles between the direction .l; m/ and the u and v axes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2.7c. If the angle between the direction .l; m/ and the w axis is small, l and m can be considered as the components of this angle measured in radians in the eastâwest and northâsouth directions, respectively. For a source near the celestial equator, measuring the visibility as a function of u and v requires observing with a two-dimensional array of interferometers, that is, an array in which the baselines between pairs of antennas contain components in the northâsouth as well as the eastâwest directions. Although we have considered only eastâwest baselines, the results derived in terms of angles measured with respect to a plane that is normal to the baseline hold for any baseline direction. A source at a high declination (near the celestial pole) can be imaged in two dimensions with either one- or two-dimensional arrays, as shown in Fig. 1.15 and"

(19.3.22) vanishes. The probability density function for the Ds1 (2536) signal is given by Eq. (19.3.22) which includes eï¬ciency corrections obtained in the (cos Î±, Î², cos Î³) angular space determined from MC simulation; the background contribution is modeled in that space using the M (Dâ+ KS0 ) sideband regions.

The good agreement of the data with theoretical predictions for the angular distribution of the axial meson, identifies the spin-parity of the Ds1 (2536) to be 1+ . The fit results given in Eq.

Variables are inserted in the text at places indicated by %. After % comes a specification of the formatting, e.g, %f (real number), %d (integer), or %s (string). The format %9.3f means a real number in decimal notation, with 3 decimals, written in a field of width equal to 9 characters. The variant %.3f means that the number is written as compactly as possible, in decimal notation, with three decimals. Switching f with e or E results in the scientific notation, here 1.290e+01 or 1.290E+01. Writing %5d means that an integer is to be written in a field of width equal to 5 characters. Real numbers can also be specified with %g, which is used to automatically choose between decimal or scientific notation, from what gives the most compact output (typically, scientific notation is appropriate for very small and very large numbers and decimal notation for the intermediate range). A typical example of when printf formatting is required, arises when nicely aligned columns of numbers are to be printed.

80,771,0.246,Innovations in Quantitative Risk Management (Volume 99.0),"7 Conclusion and Discussion Goodness-of-fit tests for Archimedean copulas, also suited to high dimensions were presented. The proposed tests are based on a transformation T whose inverse is known for generating random variates. The tests can, therefore, be viewed as analogs to tests based on Rosenblattâs transformation, whose inverse is also used for sampling (known as the conditional distribution method). The suggested goodness-of-fit tests proceed in two steps. In the first step, the first d â 1 components of T are applied. They provide a fast and simple transformation from d to d â 1 dimensions. This complements known goodness-of-fit tests using only the dth component of T , the Kendall distribution function, but which require the knowledge of the generator derivatives. In a second step, the d â 1 components are mapped to one-dimensional quantities, which simplifies testing. This second step is common to many goodnessof-fit tests and hence any such test can be applied. The power of the proposed testing approach was compared to other known goodness-of-fit tests in a large-scale simulation study. In this study, goodness-offit tests in comparably high dimensions were investigated. The computational effort (precision, runtime) involved in applying commonly known testing procedures turned out to be tremendous. The results obtained from these tests in higher dimensions have to be handled with care: Numerical issues for the methods for which not all repetitions could be run without problems might have introduced a bias. To apply commonly known goodness-of-fit tests in higher dimensions requires (much) more work in the future, especially on the numerical side. Computational tools which systematically check for numerical inaccuracies and which are implemented on the paradigm of defensive programming might provide a solution here; see [17] for a first work in this direction."

389,154,0.246,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"where zb is the thickness of the bottom layer. defined here as 2 m. The estimated temporal and vertical distribution of bottom turbidity (Fig. 6.7a) shows that significant turbidity variation occurred predominantly below 2 m above the seabed in autumn 2012. The cumulative transport rate qb (Fig. 6.7b) demonstrates that southward transport dominated and occurred stepwise during type 2 high wave periods (HW3 and HW5 in Fig. 6.7b), which have longer wave periods and larger bottom shear stresses, as shown in Figs. 6.5a and 6.6a. In contrast, as discussed, the bottom currents represent temporal variations with a periodicity around 5 days, and southward currents occurred in the intervals between low pressure atmospheric events. As a result, significant southward bottom turbidity transport was induced during high wave periods HW3 and HW5 (Fig. 6.7b), in the interval between low pressure events when higher bottom turbidities and southward bottom currents co-occurred. From these observational results, it is revealed that successive low pressure passages and the associated spatial distributions of atmospheric pressure influenced both the current and wave fields, and that significant southward bottom turbidity transports were induced by the co-occurrence of high waves coming from EâENE with longer periods (favorable for high bottom turbidity) and southward bottom currents in the interval between low pressure passages (Fig. 6.8). The relationship between waves and currents through atmospheric conditions is an important influence on bottom processes off the Fukushima coast."
165,220,0.245,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"because the maximum departure of S from D occurs when one group is dispersed widely across areas where it is over-represented, thus resulting in small departures of pi from P in these areas. This is demographically more feasible when one group is small in comparison to the other and it is less feasible when groups are equal in size. Elsewhere I establish that the D â SMin relationship when groups are equal in size is S = DÂ² (Fossett 2015). This relationship is reflected in the curve that is closest to the diagonal. This curve documents that the absolute and relative magnitude of the possible D-S difference can be substantial even when it is at its minimum. The D-S difference when groups are equal in size reaches a maximum of 25 points when D is 50 and it is 20 points or more when D is in the range 28â72. In relative terms, the value of S can be up to 20 % lower than the value of D when D is 80; up to 30 % lower when D is 70; up to 40 % lower when D is 60; up to 50 % lower when D is 50; and so on. The D â SMin curves plotted at selected values of P depart further from the diagonal as the racial composition of the city becomes progressively more imbalanced. Since most White-Minority segregation comparisons in empirical studies involve groups that differ greatly in size, these curves are highly relevant. They document that potential D-S differences can be very large in both absolute and relative terms under combinations of D and P that are common in âreal worldâ settings. When P is 85, the D â SMin difference exceeds 25 when D is in the range of 30â93 and it exceeds 40 when D is in the range of 56â83. In relative terms, the value of S can be up to 50 % lower than the value D when D â¤ 82 and 70 % lower or more when D â¤ 58 . The potential D-S differences are even more dramatic when P is 95 or higher. For example, when P is 95, the D â SMin difference exceeds 25 when D is in the range of 28â98 and it exceeds 40 when D is in the range of 44â96. In relative terms, the value of S can be up to 50 % lower than the value D when D â¤ 94 and 70 % lower or more when D â¤ 84. Importantly, group size differentials of this magnitude are common in empirical studies of segregation in US cities. For example, they are typical of White-Asian comparisons in most cities and they are typical of White-Latino comparisons in the ânew destinationâ communities of the Midwest, South, and Northeast. The potential for D-S differences to be very large in these situations is clearly revealed in Fig. 7.4. The patterns seen here provide compelling evidence that the prevailing practice of examining only D in empirical studies of segregation should be reconsidered. The curves in the figure document that the level of group separation and area racial polarization as measured by S can vary widely across cities that are identical in terms of group displacement from even distribution (D) and relative group size (P). Figure 7.5 makes the same point but from the vantage point of the separation index (S) instead of the dissimilarity index (D). Here the diagonal depicts the values of D plotted by S when displacement from even distribution is maximally concentrated (SMax). The curves in the figure depict the values of D plotted by S when displacement from even distribution is maximally dispersed. The implication of these curves is straightforward. If one is interested in group separation as measured by S, D is an unreliable indicator because D can take very high values when groups are not residentially separated. This occurs when group displacement from even"

165,194,0.245,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"To illustrate selected points from the preceding discussion, I compare four integration-promoting exchanges for a hypothetical city that is populated by only White and Black households and has an overall proportion White of 0.50. For simplicity, I assume all areas are the same size and are populated with 100 households. Under these assumptions, relative impact of an exchange on S is strictly determined by the impact the exchange has on the White-Black difference in segregationrelevant average contact with Whites (p) for the 200 households residing in the two areas involved in the exchange.8 For the purposes of this discussion I will designate this difference with the Greek letter lambda (Î») and express it in percentage form (instead of as proportions) for ease of presentation and discussion. Figure 7.2 presents results for two pairs of hypothetical exchanges. The first panel summarizes results for a pair of integration-promoting exchanges that involve areas on opposite sides of P, one above parity and the other below parity. The second panel summarizes results for a pair of integration-promoting exchanges that involve two areas that are not above parity. I begin by discussing the pair of exchanges in the first panel. The first exchange shown involves two areas that are highly polarized on racial composition. The first area (Area 1) is an all-White area with 100 White and 0 Black households. The second area (Area 2) is all-Black area with 0 White and 100 Black households. The integration-promoting exchange moves a White household from Area 1 (higher p) to Area 2 (lower p) and a Black household from Area 2 (lower p) to Area 1 (higher p). Following the exchange, Area 1 has 99 White households and 1 Black household and Area 2 has 1 White household and 99 Black households.

297,714,0.244,The R Book,"The main distributions used in hypothesis testing are: chi-squared, for testing hypotheses involving count data; Fisherâs F, in analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparing two variances; and Studentâs t, in smallsample work for comparing two parameter estimates. These distributions tell us the size of the test statistic that could be expected by chance alone when nothing was happening (i.e. when the null hypothesis was true). Given the rule that a big value of the test statistic tells us that something is happening, and hence that the null hypothesis is false, these distributions deï¬ne what constitutes a big value of the test statistic (its critical value). For instance, if we are doing a chi-squared test, and our test statistic is 14.3 on 9 degrees of freedom (d.f.), we need to know whether this is a large value (meaning the null hypothesis is probably false) or a small value (meaning that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected). In the old days we would have looked up the value in chi-squared tables. We would have looked in the row labelled 9 (the degrees of freedom row) and the column headed by Î± = 0.05. This is the conventional value for the acceptable probability of committing a Type I error: that is to say, we allow a 1 in 20 chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (see p. 358).

29,25,0.244,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","Differences in Connectivity, Visual Responses and Functional Impact of PV Versus SST Interneurons The in vivo functional role of any given neuron type is dictated by it sources of inputs, the way that it integrates those inputs, and the other neurons in the network to which it provides outputs. These differences result in measurable differences in visual receptive fields and differences in functional impact that can be assayed to understand how networks of neurons work together to generate perception and behavior. Differential Outputs and Inputs Among the first differences observed between SST and PV interneurons were morphological differences related to the locations of their synaptic contacts onto excitatory pyramidal neurons. The great majority of PV neurons are basket cells, so named because their axon terminals have the appearance of baskets. Basket cells make multiple, large synapses on the proximal dendrites and cell bodies of pyramidal neurons (Jones and Hendry 1984) and, therefore, even the connections originating from a single neuron may profoundly influence the activity of a recipient pyramid (Tamas et al. 2000, 2004). The typical basket cell expresses PV and is fast-spiking (FS; Cauli et al. 1997; Gonchar and Burkhalter 1997; Kawaguchi and Kubota 1997). FS basket cells are the most common inhibitory cell type and comprise about half of all cortical inhibitory neurons. In contrast, SST interneurons are dendrite targeting and most are âMartinotti cellsâ (Kawaguchi and Kubota 1997; Wang et al. 2004; Xu and Callaway 2009). Martinotti cells are regular spiking and have axons that typically extend to layer 1, where they make connections onto the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. This observation led to the suggestion that Martinotti cells selectively inhibit excitatory inputs that impinge on the apical tufts of pyramids. This hypothesis was first suggested with respect to Martinotti cells in the hippocampus (Somogyi et al. 1998) where they might selectively influence input from the perforant path versus the Schaeffer collaterals that selectively target the corresponding regions of CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the cortex, however, there is"

231,514,0.243,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The CMIP5 simulations show a small (about 1Â° for the multi-model ensemble means) poleward shift in the position of the Atlantic jet stream for the RCP8.5 scenario, while its speed remains nearly constant (Barnes and Polvani 2013). The poleward shift in the position of the Atlantic jet steam was found to reduce its north-south wobble as well as to enhance the variability of its speed (i.e. more of a pulsing of the jet stream). Woollings and Blackburn (2012) obtained consistent results based on the CMIP3 simulations, both with regard to a poleward shift in the mean position of the Atlantic jet stream and to considerable variations between individual models, particularly in winter. The poleward shifts were often small compared to the errors in the simulation of the jet stream position. Moreover, Woollings and Blackburn (2012) found that the NAO in combination with the East Atlantic pattern (EA) of the large-scale circulation can describe both the climatological changes and the interannual variations of both the position and strength of the Atlantic jet stream at the tropopause level. It is largely the NAO that describes shifts in the position of the jet, whereas the NAO and EA are both associated with changes in the strength of the jet. The mechanisms underlying a poleward shift in the jet stream are still not fully understood. Changes in the activity of large-scale planetary waves or in the characteristics of the synoptic-scale transient wave activity have been suggested to contribute to the poleward shift (e.g. Collins et al. 2013). Haarsma et al. (2013) found an eastward extension to the zonal winds at 500 hPa over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and western Europe, primarily related to changes in the tropospheric temperature proï¬le. The temperature changes in two regions were found to be important for forcing the changes in mean zonal flow: the relatively strong upper-tropospheric warming in the subtropics and the reduced surface warming in the mid-latitudes. Inter-model differences in the projected changes in mean zonal flow over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and western Europe could be partly attributed to uncertainties in the response of the North Atlantic Ocean to the anthropogenic forcing in both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models."

Do simulations in R to find this probability. b) What is the probability that at least one device functions? Do simulations in R to find this probability. Solution. Let D1 and D2 denote the events that the first and second device functions, respectively. We know P (D1) = 0.6, P (D2) = 0.7 We recognise that in (a) we are asked to find the joint probability P (D1 â© D2) and we are asked to do this in R via computer simulation. If we were not asked to do simulations, we would simply use the knowledge of independence of D1 and D2, and this would lead us to P (D1 â© D2) = P (D1)P (D2) = 0.42. We also recognise that in (b) we are asked to find P (D1 âª D2) = 1 â P (notD1 âª D2) where we use independence again, so this is equal to 1 â P (notD1)P (notD2) = 1 â 0.4 Ã 0.3 = 1 â 0.12 = 0.88 Before we write an R code to solve (a) and (b), it helps to first write a pseudo-code where we sketch the basic ideas and flows in the R code. Here is a pseudo-code for our example in several steps: 1) We define a counter A. We set it to 0. Counter A will store number of times (out of 10000) where D1=1 and D2=1, i.e. the number of times when both devices worked. 2) We decide that D1 is a variable that has a value of 1 if the first device works, and zero otherwise. We need to decide how we do such a simulation. We can check if R is having a function to simulate a dichotomous or binary variable (both D1 and D2 are dichotomous or binary discrete variables). If R does not have a simulation of dichotomous or binary variables then we use this trick: to simulate a binary variable u1 with P(D1=1)=0.6 we simulate a random number from a uniform distribution on [0,1] interval, let call this simulated number c. Then if cÂ¡=0.6, we set D1=1 (i.e. we say the first device functions), and if cÂ¿0.6 then we set u1=0 (i.e. we say that the first device does not work). Can you see why this trick work? 3) We decide that D2 is a variable that has a value of 1 if the second device works, and zero otherwise. To simulate values of D2 we do the same trick as above, but with 0.7 (instead of 0.6). Can you see that this simulates D1 and D2 independently? 4) We decide to simulate D1 and D2 10,000 times. Obviously, the more simulations the higher precision of our estimate will be, and the longer we need to wait for the computer to do all the simulations."

The refractive scale is the size of the diffractive scattering disk, which is the projection of the cone of scattered radiation on the scattering screen, located a distance R from the observer.

In spite of the likelihood that the Simple-like RF subunit results from the push-pull arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory feedforward inputs selective for the same orientation, the diversity of feature selectivity expressed by the Complex-like RF subunits is not consistent with a strict iso-orientation preference rule for excitatory and inhibitory input conductance as generally posited (Ferster and Miller 2000; Priebe and Ferster 2012). Although the estimated Complex-like subunits are operational filters that do not necessarily correspond to the RFs of neurons presynaptic to the recorded cell, they bear a striking resemblance to the linear RF of V1 Simple cells, which suggests that they could correspond to separate subcircuits originating from within the cortex (Rust et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2007). The diversity of orientation and spatial frequency preferences of the Complex subunits agrees with that found in the tuning of the excitatory and inhibitory input conductances measured by voltage clamp techniques in vivo and previously reported by our lab (Monier et al. 2003, 2008).

These are allowed to vary in the fit. The time-dependent p.d.f. for this fit is convolved with a decay time resolution function derived from a fit to the RS events. The D0 lifetime is also determined from RS events, and is found to agree with the world average (Beringer et al., 2012). Signal samples consisting of 658, 986 RS (purity 99%) and 3, 009 WS (purity 50%) candidates are selected. Major sources of background come from a variety of wrongly reconstructed D0 decays, wrongly associated slow pions or from a combination of both. In the WS sample, a small background also comes from events in which both K + and Ï â are mis-identified in the PID detectors. Simulated samples of these categories are used to determine the contributions of each in the data. The shape of background events in the RS and WS Dalitz plots are determined from M and Îm sideband regions in the data. For both the RS and WS fits, eï¬ciency variations over the Dalitz plot are estimated from MC samples generated uniformly over the phase space. The Dalitz plots for the RS and WS samples, together with the distributions of M and Îm for the WS sample are shown in Fig. 19.2.19. In each of the Dalitz plots, bands due to charged and neutral states for K â (890) and for charged Ï are easily seen. CF modes preferentially decay via K â Ï while DCS modes preferentially decay via KÏ amplitudes. Values for xâ² and y â² are obtained for the combined D0 and D0 samples. Separate values are also obtained from fits to each of the two subsamples (for the latter see more details in Section 19.2.7). In all cases, a value for r0 is required. This is derived from the ratio NWS /NRS , where NWS (NRS ) is the number of wrong-sign (right-sign) signal events observed and their respective time-integrated p.d.f.s. This procedure introduces a correlation between the xâ² and y â² values obtained from the fit. Uncertainties in these mixing parameters are, therefore derived from the values obtained in a similar way for 106 pairs of values for (xâ² /r0 , y â² /r0 ) randomly generated in accordance with the fit covariance matrix (assuming Gaussian errors and including systematic uncertainties). The major systematic uncertainties arise from uncertainties in resonance masses and widths, and KÏ S-wave parameters in the decay amplitude models, variations in the estimates for the numbers of WS and RS signal events and in parameters describing the time resolution.

372,627,0.243,Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy : Third Edition (Edition 3),"This formula can be used for checking that &a is not too large. Two aspects of the behavior predicted by Eq. (6.81) should be mentioned. First, if the source is near the m0 axis and at a low declination, the averaging has very little effect. This is because the ridges of the sinusoidal corrugations of the visibility function then run approximately parallel to the u0 axis, and in the transformation u0 D u cosec Ä±0 , the period of the variations in the v direction is expanded by a large factor. In comparison, the arc through which any baseline vector moves in time &a is small, and hence, the averaging has only a small effect on the visibility amplitude. Second, for a source on the l0 axis, Ra is independent of Ä±0 . In this case, the ridges of the corrugations run parallel to the v axis, and the expansion of the scale in the v direction has no effect on the sinusoidal period. For arrays that contain baselines other than eastâwest, the centers of the corresponding loci in the .u0 ; v 0 / plane are offset from the origin, as in Fig. 6.13a, and a time offset is no longer equivalent to a simple rotation of axes. However, this may not increase the smearing of the visibility, so the effect may be no worse than for an eastâwest array with baselines of similar lengths."

An important constraint of these algorithms is that, at typical non-bloom concentrations, the PIC scattering represents only a few percent of the total scattering. Thus, to maximise the signal to noise ratio, satellite pixels must be aggregated in space and time, in order to define accurate mean concentrations. Currently, more verification with PIC field measurements is underway to optimise the use of PIC ocean-colour data in models (Balch et al. 2011). PIC is also produced by certain zooplanktonic organisms but these particles are too large to be detected by ocean colour (Balch et al. 1996). Different bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use ocean colour data to identify and differentiate between PFTs or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) in the surface ocean. These can be summarised into four main types: spectral-response methods which are based on differences in the shape of the light reflectance/absorption spectrum for different PFTs/PSCs (Sathyendranath et al. 2004; Alvain et al. 2005, 2008; Ciotti and Bricaud 2006; Bracher et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2011; Brewin et al. 2010a; Devred et al. 2011), methods which use information on the magnitude of chlorophyll a biomass or light absorption to distinguish between PFTs or PSCs (Devred et al. 2006; Uitz et al. 2006; Hirata et al. 2008; Brewin et al. 2010b; Hirata et al. 2011; Mouw and Yoder 2010), methods that retrieve the particle size distribution from satellite-derived backscattering signal and derive PSCs (Kostadinov et al. 2010), and ecological-based approaches which use information on environmental factors, such as temperature and wind stress, to supplement the bio-optical data for investigating PFTs (Raitsos et al. 2008). All methods derive dominant phytoplankton groups, while Uitz et al. (2006), Bracher et al. (2009, improved by Sadeghi et al. 2011) and Hirata et al. (2011) also give chl a for the different PFTs. Nearly all the PFT methods mentioned use information from the multispectral ocean colour sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS or MODIS and are based on the parameterisation of a large global or regional in situ data set in order to yield PFTs from satellite chl a or normalised water leaving radiances.

165,234,0.242,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"Once this point is acknowledged, the responsibility falls to researchers to first determine whether index choice matters for the findings obtained in any given empirical analysis and, when it does, to then report this and note the implications it may carry. All indices of uneven distribution register group differences in residential distributions differently. But some differences are negligible on practical grounds while others are potentially more important. In the case of D and S, the differences are especially likely to have important practical consequences for findings in empirical studies because they are at opposite ends of a continuum in how indices respond to group difference in distribution on area group proportion (p). Specifically, as a crude form of G, D is sensitive to rank order differences without regard to the quantitative magnitude of the differences involved while S is sensitive to quantitative differences that are large in size and is only weakly responsive to rank order differences that involve small quantitative differences.18 Understanding this difference helps clarify the nature of segregation patterns when D and S yield different results. Because D is sensitive to group differences in rank position on area group proportion (p), D can take high values even when the group differences on p are small in quantitative magnitude but are extensive. In contrast, S takes high values only when group differences on area group proportion (p) are quantitatively large, and will take low values when group differences in rank position on p are extensive but the quantitative differences involved are small. Whether one sees this practical difference between D and S as justifying the conclusion that they measure distinctly different dimensions of segregation is a matter of judgment. I take the position that, at the very least, it is important to note that the two measures are similar in measuring group differences on area group proportions (pi) and give researchers the option of assigning priority to rank-order differences or to quantitative differences. The choice between the two options is important because rank-order differences can be high even when groups live together in areas that differ by small amounts on area racial composition and quantitative differences can only be high when groups live apart in areas that differ substantially on area racial composition. Once this point is âon the tableâ, the choice between indices becomes sharply defined. If one adopts the separation index (S) one is choosing to focus on quantitative differences between group residential outcomes on racial composition and the question of whether groups live together or apart. When S takes high values, it also necessarily implies the presence of substantial differences in rank order position on racial composition as values of D cannot fall below values of S. This clearly fits well with prevailing, albeit usually implicit, notions regarding what I term âprototypicalâ segregation wherein rank-order and quantitative differences track each other closely. The contrasting possibility is when group differences in rank-order position on area racial composition (pi) are widespread, but they are small in magnitude resulting in a high-D, low-S outcome. This possibility of this outcome is not widely recognized."
70,259,0.242,Optics in Our Time,"Imagine an electron beam of an inï¬nitesimally small diameter is incident on a solid surface, as depicted in . Fig. 6.3 below. As these electrons penetrate the solid, they will interact with the sampleâs constituent atoms. This interaction is referred to as âelectron scatteringâ and is further divided into two categories: (a) an inelastic scattering, where the incident electron gives up part of its energy as a result of its collision with the solidâs atoms; and (b) an elastic scattering, which causes the electron to change its direction of travel with almost no energy loss. It is the ï¬rst scattering type, however, that gives rise to the signals enumerated in . Fig. 6.3, whilst the second type is normally what determines the shape of the interaction volume of the incident electrons within the solid under study, as depicted in . Fig. 6.4 . The shape and size of the interaction volume depends on the incident electron energy, its angle of incidence with respect to the surface and on the average atomic number of the sample under study. If one concentrates on the emitted electron signal alone and plots their number against their energy, one would in principle collect a distribution similar to that shown in . Fig. 6.5 .

Grid cells are typically aligned close to parallel to the cardinal axes of the environment. Recently, it was shown that grid representations are not limited to navigational space in that a grid map of visual space was demonstrated in the entorhinal cortex of monkeys (Killian et al. 2012). Although highly speculative, it is interesting to ponder the possibilities for similar mechanisms at play in embedding internal representations into external reference frames in the visual domain as in the spatial domain. Although not very many examples were given by Killian et al. (2012), there seems to also be a trend for grids to align with a slight offset to cardinal axes (see their Fig. 1). Further, using optical imaging in area MT (which shows movement and orientation selectivity for stimuli) in the visual system, Xu et al. (2006) showed frequency plots of activation over the range of possible stimulus orientations. In these plots, there are quite distinct peaks with bimodal offsets from the cardinal axes (Fig. 7). Upon further inspection, these offsets are very close to 7.5 , which is the exact peak we observed in the alignment offset in grid cells.

Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur had the most rapid increase. The MURs continued to hold their share of their countryâs population in the two decades between 1990 and 2010 except in the case of Manila. This reinforces Jones comments on the earlier decade that âcontrary to the conclusions reached by some observers who have used the population of the ofï¬cially designated metropolitan area to conclude that many mega-cities have passed their period of rapid growth and are holding a declining share of national populationâ. (ii) With respect to density there is a sharp difference between the two high density mega-urban regions of Manila and Jakarta and the lower density mega-urban regions of Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur has a signiï¬cantly lower density of population than the other three mega-urban regions. (iii) The zonal analysis shows that all the four Southeast Asian MURSs have experienced a slowing of population growth in the core areas but still retain a signiï¬cant proportion of the population of their MUR. In general the rates of increase in the inner zones and the proportion of their population in their MURs have increased as the built-up environment has extended from the core zones. Part of this increase is the consequence of the restructuring of urban cores that has led to out-migration of population and industry to the inner and outer zones. The outer zones have continued to grow at a faster rate with the exception of Jakarta where they have the lowest proportion of population in the four MURs outer zones from outside the MUR. From the point of view of the central arguments of this chapter the most important ï¬ndings are that the analysis shows the core and inner zones of these MURs while experiencing slower rates of increase have still increased their population size while declining in their population share of the MUR population. Secondly the inner zones have been responsible for absorbing the largest growth of population in Kuala Lumpur unlike the other MURâs. If the core and inner zones are combined then the regions have shown an increased share of the population suggesting that the four Southeast Asian mega-urban regions are exhibiting ongoing âcentralityâ of the core and inner zones in the mega-urban regions. (iv) However, in all mega-urban regions and particularly in Jakarta the outer zones are increasing their population and if present trends continue they will attract more population as these mega-urban regions continue to grow. The implications of this analysis suggests the future of mega-urban regions will involve a continuation of the thickening-up of population in core and inner zone areas but that the outer zones will attract a considerable proportion of the increase of population in the MURs over the next decades (Mc Gee 2011)."

80,344,0.24,Innovations in Quantitative Risk Management (Volume 99.0),"3 Generalised Archimedean Copula Models for Currency Exchange Rate Baskets In order to study the joint tail dependence in the investment or funding basket, we consider an overall tail dependence analysis which is parametric model based, obtained by using flexible mixtures of Archimedean copula components. Such a model approach is reasonable since typically the number of currencies in each of the long basket (investment currencies) and the short basket (funding currencies) is 4 or 5. In addition, these models have the advantage that they produce asymmetric dependence relationships in the upper tails and the lower tails in the multivariate model. We consider three models; two Archimedean mixture models and one outer power transformed Clayton copula. The mixture models considered are the Clayton-Gumbel mixture and the Clayton-Frank-Gumbel mixture, where the Frank component allows for periods of no tail dependence within the basket as well as negative dependence. We fit these copula models to each of the long and short baskets separately.

I review the formal basis for this scoring of residential outcomes for S in Appendices.10 The scaling function used for S is distinct from those that are used for other popular indices of uneven distribution. It maps the contact score (p) directly onto residential outcome scores (y) based on a one-to-one linear relationship. In contrast, the scaling functions for all other indices map the contact score (p) onto residential outcome scores (y) based on some form of positive, monotonic, nonlinear relationship. The separation index supports a clear and appealing interpretation based on pairwise âexposureâ and âcontactâ. In the case of White-Black segregation, S is the White-Black difference on average contact with Whites (p). From this vantage point, it becomes clear why it is appropriate to refer to this measure as the âseparation indexâ. The White-Black difference in contact with Whites can be large only if Whites live separately from â that is, apart from, not with â Blacks in neighborhoods that are predominantly White and Blacks live separately from Whites in areas that are predominantly Black. To clarify, in most applications indices of uneven distribution are implemented as âaspatialâ measures. In this application, the notion of separation implies only that the groups live in different areas. It does not imply that the different areas are necessarily spatially distant from each other. This would be the case when segregation involves large-scale clustering. But the index score would be the same if Whites and Blacks lived separately from each other in different areas forming a checker board pattern. The separation index also could be aptly termed the âcontact differenceâ index, but that is a bit cumbersome. Alternatively, it could be named the âconcentrationâ index following Stearns and Logan (1986), but Massey and Denton (1988) popularized the term âconcentrationâ in association with another distinct dimension of segregation. So I adopt the term âseparation indexâ (S) which emphasizes that the measure is sensitive to whether groups live apart from each other and are separated into different areas that differ fundamentally on group composition. The notion of group separation is closely connected with the notion of area or neighborhood racial polarization discussed by Stearns and Logan (1986).11 As they used it, polarization is high when the areas in which the two groups live fall primarily into two types. In the case of White-Black segregation that would be either predominantly White or predominantly Black with few areas in between. Their usage of the term polarization directs attention to a neighborhood outcome. But polarization of neighborhood racial composition has obvious implications for group differences on residential outcomes for individuals. When areas are racially polarized, individuals in both groups primarily live in neighborhoods where members of their"

165,126,0.238,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"The patterns just reviewed provide an intuitive basis for comparing indices of uneven distribution and placing them on a continuum. One end of the continuum is anchored by the separation index (S). The y-p relationship for S is linear. So it registers group differences in pairwise contact (p) in its original metric. This is wellsuited for measuring group separation and neighborhood polarization. If the group means on p differ by a large amount, it follows that groups live apart from each other with members of each group living in neighborhoods where their group predominates. If the group means on p are similar, it follows that the groups live together, not apart, and thus share similar neighborhood outcomes on pairwise racial mix (p). The other end of the continuum is anchored by the gini index (G). The y-p relationship for G is profoundly nonlinear. This is because it does not register group differences in pairwise contact (p) in its original metric. Instead, the scoring function instead converts the level of actual contact into a score for rank order position via the percentile transformation. This is well-suited for measuring ordinal differences in group contact. But it is ill-suited for measuring group separation and neighborhood polarization. Accordingly, if group means on percentile scores (y) based on pairwise group contact (p) differ by a large amount in White-Minority comparisons, one can safely conclude that Whites consistently live in neighborhoods that rank higher on proportion White than do minorities. But, one cannot conclude that the minority group lives apart from Whites in neighborhoods where the minority group predominates. This is because percentile scores logically cannot provide reliable signals about underlying quantitative differences. As a result, percentile scoring of pairwise group contact cannot provide a reliable basis for assessing group residential separation and neighborhood polarization. This is not an esoteric point. I will present empirical analyses in the next chapter that demonstrate that high scores on G can and do occur when group residential separation and neighborhood polarization is low, and in some cases even trivial. Ultimately, researchers should decide for themselves if they view this quality of G as desirable, undesirable, or irrelevant. But to decide, they first must become aware that G has this quality. In the main they are not aware and this is understandable because the issue receives little attention in methodological discussions in the literature. As a consequence, no one has set forth a well-articulated rationale for prioritizing group differences in rank order position on contact over the group differences in quantitative âraw scoreâ standing on contact.

Inspection of Table 10.2 indicates that in the theta metric, the normal prior Bayesian procedure (ST1) shows stronger relationships between gains and coursetaking than do the other two procedures. The differences in favor of ST1 are particularly strong where contrasts are being made between groups quite different in their mathematics preparation, for example, the relationship between being in the academic curriculum or taking math now and total gain. When the correlations are based on the number correct true score metric (NCRT), the ST1 Bayesian approach still does as well or better than the other two approaches. The NCRT score metric is a nonlinear transformation of the theta scores, computed by adding the probabilities of a correct answer for all items in a selected item pool. Unlike the theta metric, the NCRT metric does not stretch out the tails of the score distribution. The stretching out at the tails has little impact on most analyses where group means are used. However, it can distort gain scores for individuals who are in or near the tails of the distribution. Gains in proficiency probabilities at each proficiency level and their respective correlations with selected process variables are shown in Table 10.3.

An important consistency check for the overall shape of F (k) is to give a reasonable description of the measured shape of the photon-energy spectrum in inclusive B â Xs Î³ decays (see Section 17.9), which at leading order in 1/mb is given in terms of the same function F (k) via an expression analogous to Eq. (17.1.62). In addition to the leading shape function F (k), several additional shape functions appear at O(ÎQCD /mb ) (Bauer, Luke, and Mannel, 2003). Apart from their ï¬rst few moments, very little is known about the form of these subleading shape functions. They thus introduce an uncertainty in the theoretical predictions that is hard to quantify in a systematic fashion. An even larger number of unknown shape functions appears at O(Î±S ÎQCD /mb ) (Lee and Stewart, 2005). Weak annihilation contributions could have a large impact at large q 2 and might be another source of theoretical uncertainties. However, recent analyses (Bigi, Mannel, Turczyk, and Uraltsev, 2010; Gambino and Kamenik, 2010; Ligeti, Luke, and Manohar, 2010) have used CLEOc data to constrain contributions from weak annihilation, resulting in a rather small impact. The corresponding uncertainty is below 2% for the total rate, translating into an uncertainty of less than 1% on |Vub | for the most inclusive analyses. For the determination of |Vub | theoretical predictions by diï¬erent groups are in use. A more detailed summary and comparison can be found elsewhere (Antonelli et al., 2010a). At their core, the diï¬erent calculations are all based on Eq. (17.1.62), but they diï¬er in the treatment of the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. The BLNP approach (Bosch, Lange, Neubert, and Paz, 2004; Lange, Neubert, and Paz, 2005) preferentially treats the kinematic region p+ X âª pX where the pX and pX dependences of C factorize. This allows for the resummation of Sudakov double logarithms of p+ X /pX and pX /mB to NNLL. They also include the full O(Î±S ) corrections, for which the perturbative expansions are performed using the so-called shape-function scheme for mb , and a subset of the perturbative corrections in C are absorbed into F (k). The subleading shape functions are separately modeled and included in the predictions. The GGOU approach (Gambino, Giordano, Ossola, and Uraltsev, 2007) treats the p+ X âª pX and pX â¼ pX regions on the same footing. The coeï¬cient C is computed at ï¬xed order to O(Î±S ) and O(Î±S2 Î²0 ) (Gambino, Gardi, and Ridolï¬, 2006), where the perturbative expansion is performed using the kinetic scheme for mb .

383,317,0.236,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"interpreted in several ways. We present three here (for further discussion see the recommended book by Carlton and Devore [13], p450): 1. If the âcurrentâ state of the Markov chain is observed after a large number of transitions, there is an approximate probability Ïj of the chain being in the state j; that is for large n, P (Yn = j) â Ïj . Moreover, this holds regardless of the initial distribution of the chain (i.e. the unconditional distribution of the initial state Y0 ). (a) The first sentence above is essentially the definition of the Î  and it follows from the Steady-state theorem. (b) The second sentence above says that the effect of the initial state or the initial probability distribution of the process wears off as the number of steps of the process increase. (c) In the Cereal example, if we let the chain run for some amount of time, and then we randomly choose a customer, there is a 55.56% chance that she is buying K at that current time. 2. The long-term (i.e. long-run) proportion of time the Markov chain visits the j-th state is Ïj . So, in the Cereal example, if we let the chain run for some amount of time, then after that this is what we can say about each customer: a customer spends about 55.56% of time buying brand K and 44.44% of time buying from competitor. 3. If we assign Î  to be the initial distribution of Y0 then the distribution of Yn is also Î  for any number of subsequent transitions n. For this reason, Î  is customarily referred to as the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. Also, Î  is sometimes called the fixed probability vector transition matrix P. Example: Cereals buyers. (continues) If the initial distribution is p(0) = [0.25, 0.75], then after 20 steps the market share is: p(0) P2 0 = [0.5556, 0.4444]. We have seen, that from n=20, the Pn is not changing much. Also, we found that in the long term the proportion of the market is (0.5555556 0.4444444). What if the initial market share is [0.99, 0.01]? What will be the market share after 20 steps (years)? What if the initial distribution is [0.01, 0.99]? What will be the market share after 20 years? The effect of the initial state wears off. We also saw this previous section with the Cereal Example. Now we will do it again with the Example of Commuter Cyril. Caution! It is not possible to make long-range predictions with all transition matrices. However, for a regular transition matrix, it is always possible to make long-range predictions. In other words, a Markov process that has a regular transition matrix will have a steady state. Also, a Markov chain does not have to be regular for the limit of Pn to exist. (one example is in the book by Carlton and Devore, p449)."

In this prescription, F is normalized so that F = 1 for qr = qab . While the P - and D-waves of the decay amplitude are usually well described using a certain number of BW or GS propagators, the actual number depending on the speciï¬c decay, the S-wave typically contains a number of broad overlapping states, for which the isobar model gives a poor description. In that case, more complex alternatives have been adopted, which are reviewed in Section 13.2.2. Figure 13.2.1 illustrates how various intermediate twobody states appear in the Dalitz plot. Unlike the uniform distribution of the phase-space decay (Fig. 13.2.1(a)), scalar resonances appear as bands in the Dalitz plot, as shown in Fig. 13.2.1(b-d) for resonances in bc, ac, and ab channels, respectively. Angular distributions for vector and tensor intermediate states introduce characteristic nonuniformity of the event density along the resonance bands (Fig. 13.2.1(e,f)). Finally, the region where the amplitudes of two resonances overlap is sensitive to the phase diï¬erence between the two amplitudes (Fig. 13.2.1(g,h)). 13.2.2 K-matrix formalism The complex S-wave dynamics, which can also include the presence of several broad and overlapping scalar resonances, can alternatively be described through the use of a K-matrix formalism (Chung et al., 1995; Wigner, 1946) with the production vector (P-vector) approximation (Aitchison, 1972). Within this formalism, the production process described by the P-vector can be viewed as the initial formation of several states, which are then propagated by the K-matrix term into the ï¬nal state that is observed. This approach ensures that the two-body scattering matrix respects unitarity, which is not guaranteed in the case of the isobar model. At the B Factories this approach is most commonly used to describe the Ï + Ï â S-wave contribution to the Dalitz-plot amplitude, e.g. in the BABAR analyses (Aubert, 2008l, 2009h; del Amo Sanchez, 2010a,b) and Belle analysis (Abe, 2007b).

244,334,0.236,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","Bayesian inference comes in many different flavors, depending on the type of probability formalism that is employed. The main distinction between Bayesian inference and classical, frequentist inference (an amalgam of the approaches of Fisher and Neyman) is that, in the former, distribution parameters of interest are treated as random quantities, rather than as fixed quantities. The Bayesian procedure requires specification of a so-called prior distribution, based on information available before data collection. Once relevant data are collected, they can be combined with the prior distribution to yield a so-called posterior distribution which represents current belief about the likely values of the parameter. This approach can be directly applied to evaluating competing hypotheses, so that one can speak of the posterior probabilities associated with different hypothesesâthese are the conditional probabilities of the hypotheses, given prior beliefs and the data collected. As many teachers of elementary (and not so elementary) statistics are aware, these are the kinds of interpretations that many ascribe (incorrectly) to the results of a frequentist analysis. Over the last 50 years, the Bayesian approach to statistical inference has gained more adherents, particularly as advances in computer hardware/software have made Bayesian calculations more feasible. Both theoretical developments and successful applications have moved Bayesian and quasi-Bayesian methods closer to normative statistical practice. In this respect, a number of ETS researchers have made significant contributions in advancing the Bayesian approach, as well as providing a Bayesian perspective on important statistical issues. This section is organized into three sections: Bayes for classical models, later Bayes, and empirical Bayes."

They provide a very tractable family of distributions and have tails which provide bounded relative error regardless of how rare the event is. Examples of simulating values of risk measures demonstrate a very substantial improvement over crude Monte Carlo and a smaller improvement over competitors such as the exponential tilt. This advantage is considerable for relatively low-dimensional problems, but there may be little or no advantage over an exponential tilt when the dimensionality of the problem increases.

The practical consequence for D-S comparisons is this. At a given level of displacement as measured by the dissimilarity index (D), the value of the separation index (S) can vary independently and by substantial amounts depending on whether group distributions both between âabove-parityâ areas and âotherâ areas and within ânon-parityâ areas tend toward maximum area racial polarization or minimum area racial polarization. The former concentrates both groups in homogeneous areas and maximizes same-group contact and group separation. The latter disperses both groups across less homogeneous areas and minimizes same-group contact and group separation. Ultimately, as I show below, this leads to the following conclusion about the relationship between D and S. At a given level of displacement (D), the value of the separation index (S) can vary substantially depending on whether group distributions within ânon-parityâ areas tend toward concentration or dispersion. When concentration within non-parity areas is at its maximum, the value of S will equal the value of D. But when concentration is at its minimum â that is, when groups are maximally dispersed across non-parity areas, the value of S will be lower, sometimes much lower, than the value of D. Intuitively, one can get to these two alternative outcomes via simple steps as follows. At a given level of displacement, implement as many segregation-promoting exchanges as possible within non-parity areas. If such exchanges can be made, group residential distributions will shift toward the pattern of âprototypical segregationâ and the value of S will increase. The value of D will not change so the D-S disparity will decrease. Ultimately, the value of S will rise until it reaches the value of D and D-S disparity will be zero. Alternatively, implement as many integration-promoting exchanges as possible within non-parity areas. If such exchanges can be made, group residential distributions will shift toward the pattern of âdispersed displacementâ and the value of S will decrease. The value of D will not change so D-S disparity will increase. Ultimately, S will fall until it reaches its minimum possible level and the D-S disparity reaches its maximum. At the conclusion of the process, S will take a value substantially below the value of D."
