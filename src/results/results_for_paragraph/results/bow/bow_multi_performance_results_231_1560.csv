Large numbers of leatherback sea turtles are captured each year in the Gulf as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. Hawksbills are the rarest of the five species of sea turtle that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and their current abundance is only a fraction of historical levels because millions were killed for tortoiseshell (jewelry, combs, brushes, buttons, etc.) during the past 100 years. Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal. In summary, because sea turtles are difficult to study and since some species have been studied more than others, there are significant gaps in the data available by species, as well as by life stage. However, despite the data gaps and limitations associated with selected data sets"
337,24,0.379,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"science during environmental crises through two case studies â the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Sandy. Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known"
264,64,0.372,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"arriving on surf beaches come from more than one storm, and if we add two similar sine functions we get a curve with three peaks. Everyone has their own examplesâICMIâs Klein Project is a multilingual collection of contemporary mathematics written for teachers. It would be nice if the pleasure that we get from mathematics imbued the whole of mathematics education, but we know it does not. Why not? How do we manage to take the pleasure out of mathematics? This question underlies all that follows. Let me now return to Ubiratan DâAmbrosio. It is an honour to be following up Ubiratan DâAmbrosioâs thinking, so let me briefly, and with a broad brush-stroke, go over what he was on about. He questioned inequity within mathematics education in a very fundamental way, and gave us some models for working towards creating a fairer world through a mathematics education that really paid attention to social and cultural issues. Many, many people have worked very strongly in this area, and I do not intend to give a summary of the comprehensive work that has been done. In more recent years, Ubiratan DâAmbrosio started to talk about mathematics as a dorsal spine. I want to highlight this metaphor because it is a very nice way of thinking about what has happened. He sees mathematics as the dorsal spine of civilization, the basis of science and technology (DâAmbrosio, 2007, 2015). The trouble is that you may have a spine and skeleton on which an animal may be built, but that animal sometimes turns into a monster rather than a beautiful creature. This has happened within mathematics, and, I would argue, within mathematics education. DâAmbrosio suggests that our essential goals are responsible creativity and ethical citizenship. What he did was highlight the role of mathematics and mathematics education in achieving both of those goals. In other words, he was pointing us to the wider reasons for our work as mathematicians and mathematics educators. But how? How do we do this? What is it I am supposed to do to engender responsible creativity and ethical citizenship? When I walk up the steps and go into my ofï¬ce, what actions will I take? I can presumably do some things in the way I behave, but how do I help to engender appropriate actions in the students that I teach? How are we to build a beautiful creature and not a monster. I think that DâAmbrosioâs essential message is that we should reinstate cultural processes within mathematics education in order to build beautiful creatures. I wish to think about what other things we might do. To develop a basis for making possible actions more explicit I would like to invoke ecological systems theory, which was developed in the context of child development by Urie Bronfenbrenner in 1979, a couple of years after DâAmbrosio introduced the ethnomathematical approach. The two theories have some overlapping principles (Bronfenbrenner, 1992)."

Cold stress due to periodic shutdown of power plants used as refuges by manatees has also decreased in recent years, due to concerted human action.

71,1409,0.368,Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides: Volume 1 ISDR-ICL Sendai Partnerships 2015-2025 (Volume 1.0),"Terraces, traditionally sustained by dry stonewalls, occupy about thirty percent of the territory of Liguria. If constantly maintained, they effectively contribute to slow down the natural slope erosion. When no longer managed, terraces may increase geomorphological risk along the slopes and, consequently, at the bottom of the valley (Brandolini et al. 2012). Bad weather such as flash rain worsen the background hazard causing severe damages and devastation across Italy and weight over the economy of a country that has to faces a large variety of disasters. Italy faces emergency but efforts on prevention are not enough to deal with the problem. Emergency often announced with âstate of alertâ, and results in schools closure to try minimize the number of people on the roads during heavy rain. In addition to damage to infrastructure and housing, bad weather also affects agriculture. According to Coldiretti (Italyâs largest agricultural association) heavy rain, overflown rivers and landslides will cost millions of euros to the agricultural sector due to land and crop damage. Farmland overflown with water, vegetables production and plants cultivation located near rivers registered the worst images. The terraced landscape is very common in the Ligurian region, covering about of the 30% of the territory. Agricultural terraces are sustained by dry stonewalls and reduce the slow down the natural slope erosion, but if no regularly maintained, can worst the risk of landslides and âdetritus flowâ. Since 1970 recurring floods affect Genoa where the Bisagno Stream catchment flows across the eastern part of city center. The most recent and tragic was in October 2014 (Faccini et al. 2016). The 5 Terre peculiarity of little towns cling to sheer hills along a narrow, rugged strip of land between the Maritime Alps, the Apennine Mountains and the Ligurian Sea is results into a heavy geo-hydrological risk. The fragile land conditions turn into instability during unusual meteorological conditions that causes heavy flooding. This happened in October 2011 when the river rushed violently down dislocating and destroying several towns, redeï¬ning the natural architecture of the affected the Vara and Magra Valleys near La Spezia (Piangiamore et al. 2015) (Figs. 2 and 3)."

Salt treatments commence after seedling establishment in hydroponics, at the 2â3 leaf stage. Information on responses of standard genotypes (tolerant, intermediate and sensitive) is given to which test seedlings are compared. Visual symptoms of salinity stress include reduced leaf area, whitish appearance of lower leaves, leaf tip death, leaf rolling and seedling death. Scoring is carried out according to the standard evaluation system developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Recommended test salt concentrations are given along with a method to recover selected seedlings and examples of use."

193,145,0.361,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"The fact that Ukrainian migrants can transfer the money earned abroad personally without having to bear additional transfer costs is an advantage of temporary, especially circular, migration (Grotte 2012). However, qualitative studies on the remitting behaviour of Ukrainian migrants report negative examples of Ukrainian migrants being robbed on the way back to or upon arrival in Ukraine (Grotte 2012; Kindler 2011). A study conducted in Italy (Weber 2004) indicates that difficulty in re-negotiating social status when back in Ukraine may constitute a constraint on return, and rather a motivation to remain abroad longer than initially intended, going home only for short periods of time. This shows that the âstatus tensionsâ experienced by temporary migrants, as well as by their children, are strongly linked to their statuses in their countries of origin, which can impact not only temporal patterns of mobility but also the well-being of both migrants and their families. This also demonstrates that lowprestige work in the destination country does deprive migrants of their social status, partially challenging the claim put forward, for example, by the dual labour market theory of Piore (1979) that such deprivation should be lower or non-existent in the case of temporary migrants. This is due to the fact that the Ukrainian migrants studied had experienced tensions about their social position in the country of origin. The risk of deskilling or de-qualification is high for temporary Ukrainian migrants (see Triandafyllidou 2011; Caglar et al. 2011; Iglicka et al. 2011). The temporary migration of Ukrainian citizens is often related to temporary jobs that do not require high skills and belong to the so-called secondary sector of the labour market. Consequently, studies in a number of countries have found loss of skills among educated Ukrainian migrants performing low-skilled jobs (Antoniewski and KoryÅ 2002; Shakhno and Pool 2005; Fedyuk 2012). For example, a study based on two national surveys of foreigners in the Czech Republic provides evidence of a significant waste of human capital among Ukrainians (Leontiyeva 2014; see also Chap. 8). A crucial finding of this study is that migrants âwith permanent residence permits turned out to be twice as likely to have skilled jobs compared to those with temporary residence permits and were half as likely to end up on the bottom rungs of the labour marketâ (Leontiyeva 2014:74). This suggests that the temporal dimension of migration, related to legal status on the Czech labour market, intersects with the risk of deskilling among migrants, which tends to be higher for temporary migrants. Irregular stay means higher risks and consequently higher mobility costs between Ukraine and the country of migration (see Chap. 4). However, paradoxically, efforts to gain legal status, even temporary, or to take part in seasonal migrant worker programmes, may lead to negative financial and other consequences for migrants."
390,578,0.361,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"ur lives are full of repetition. We count the days through the natural rhythms of the rotation of the earth, the revolution of the moon around the earth, and of the earth around the sun. Each day is different, but our lives are often structured by standard routines that are similar from day to day. In a sense, repetition is also the essence of computing. Nobody needs a computer to add two numbers together. (Letâs hope not, anyway!) But adding a thousand or a million numbers together? Thatâs a job for a computer. This relationship of computing and repetition was obvious early on. In Ada Lovelaceâs famous 1843 discussion of Charles Babbageâs Analytical Engine, she wrote: Both for brevity and for distinctness, a recurring group is called a cycle. A cycle of operations, then, must be understood to signify any set of operations which is repeated more than once. It is equally a cycle, whether it be repeated twice only, or an indefinite number of times; for it is the fact of a repetition occurring at all that constitutes it such. In many cases of analysis there is a recurring group of one or more cycles; that is, a cycle of a cycle, or a cycle of cycles."

222,232,0.358,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The number of historical flood events from 1954 to 2014, categorised by extent, are shown in Table 8.1 (BWDB 2015). Extreme, dry and average flood years are defined by the national area flooded. Twenty-five per cent of all flood events occurred during extreme flood years and caused significant damage. Two typical examples of fluvial floods, one for an average flood condition (year 2000) and one for an extreme flood condition (year 1998), are shown in Fig. 8.2. The location of the discharge measurement stations are the entry points of the rivers into Bangladesh from India. The Brahmaputra water level starts rising from the early monsoon (JuneâJuly) and reaches its first peak in the third week of July. It then falls and rises again and, in an average flood year, attains its second peak in the first week of August. The Ganges has a single peak of flood level occurring in the second week of September. For the Upper Meghna, the first flood peak occurs in the second or third week of May, and, in an average flood year, a second peak occurs close to the second peak of the Brahmaputra. The effect of flow from the Upper Meghna on overall flooding is small as its discharge only represents ten per cent of the combined discharges of Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers (Islam et al. 2010). The different timing of the flood peaks of the major rivers are mainly due to variations in rainfall in the upper catchments and the travel time to reach the discharge measurement points considered. Synchronisation of the peaks across the three rivers is rare, but has occurred: the floods of 1988 and 1998 (see Fig. 8.2) being examples (Islam and Chowdhury 2002). During peak synchronisation, the second peak of the Brahmaputra is delayed or may occur as a third peak coinciding with the single peak of the Ganges. This triggers significant fluvial flooding in Bangladesh."
311,792,0.356,The Physics of the B Factories,"Their choice avoids unphysical singularities which are generated at q 2 = t+ by the outer function in a truncated BGL parameterization. Further, Bourrely, Caprini, and Lellouch (2009) optimize the parameter t0 such that the semileptonic domain is mapped onto a symmetric interval in z. With the choice t0 = (mB + mÏ )( mB â mÏ )2 , the value of |z| < 0.279. Although the BCL parameterization has a simpler functional form, the constraint on the series is more complicated than Eq. (17.1.50) in that it is no longer diagonal in the series index k. We use the BCL parameterization to obtain |Vub | in Section 17.1.4.3. A diï¬erent approach suggested by Flynn and Nieves (2007a,b) uses the OmneÌs parameterization, allowing one to express the form-factor shape in terms of the elastic BÏ scattering phase shift and the value of f+ (q 2 ) at a few subtraction points below the BÏ production threshold. Lattice QCD form-factor calculations State-of-the-art LQCD computations now regularly include the eï¬ects of three light dynamical quarks. Often calculations are done in the isospin limit with two lighter degenerate quarks and one heavier quark with a mass close to the physical strange quark; these are referred to as â2+1â ï¬avor simulations. In practice, limited computational resources prohibit calculations with simulated values of the u- and d-quark as light as those in the real world. LQCD calculations must also be done at ï¬xed, nonzero values of the lattice spacing. Hence one generates data with a sequence of light-quark masses (down to â¼ mstrange /10 for current B â Ï calculations) and a sequence of lattice spacings (down to a â¼ 0.09 fm for current B â Ï calculations) and extrapolates the remainder of the way to the physical masses and zero lattice spacing. Because these limits are interrelated, it is now standard to use model-independent functional forms derived in Chiral Perturbation Theory (ÏPT) for the speciï¬c lattice quark formulation being used (i.e. including discretization corrections) to guide the extrapolation (see, e.g., Aubin and Bernard, 2007, for the case of B â Ï). This procedure leaves a remaining systematic uncertainty in the physical matrix element due"

352,478,0.351,Interface Oral Health Science 2014,"It has been reported that many types of cytokines are expressed during mechanical loading of the periodontal ligament. TNF-Î± is an important molecule in mechanical loading force-induced osteoclast formation in the periodontal ligament during orthodontic tooth movement. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between TNF-Î±-induced osteoclast formation and the cytokines expressed during mechanical loading. Th1 cytokines inhibited osteoclast and odontoclast formation during mechanical loading in the periodontal ligament. There is a possibility that local injection of Th1 cytokines might be a useful tool to enhance the anchorage site and control the rate of tooth movement during orthodontic treatment, as well as prevent relapse after orthodontic treatment. Moreover, local injection of Th1 cytokines might be a useful tool in reducing root resorption, particularly for highrisk teeth.

In Norway, there has also been an increase in for-proï¬t welfare from 61,000 full-time employees in 2006 to 84,500 in 2012. In Denmark, which has the smallest share of 7.1%, there has been a real growth from 38,000 to 44,000 full-time employees. At the moment, the public-sector employment share is almost the same in all three Scandinavian countries, between 78 and 79% of the welfare employment. However, it is decreasing rapidly in Sweden withâ 3.6% points in a 5-year average andâ1.5% points in Norway, but it is increasing by 0.5% points in Denmark. In Norway, the public sector is still growing in real numbers, from 429,000 full-time employees in 2006 to 500,000 in 2013. In Denmark, the public sector reached a maximum in 2010 with 549,000 full-time employees, and in Sweden it peaked in 2007 with 974,000 employees.3 Although the public-sector shares still may seem large in comparative perspective, they are decreasing in real numbers primarily as a result of for-proï¬t growth. This adds a new feature to the âsocial democratic modelâ, previously characterized by high public welfare spending and a small nonproï¬t sector. The public sector was preferred as a service provider to ensure unitary standards and equal access for all (Anheier and Salamon 2006; Salamon and Anheier 1998). For-proï¬t sector growth also sets the Scandinavian countries apart from the corporatist and liberal countries, which have much larger nonproï¬t sectors (Salamon et al. 2004). To sum up, in Sweden, the public-sector employment has decreased in real numbers, and a decline has recently started in Denmark too. In Norway, with no need for austerity measures, all three sectors still grow in real numbers, although the public sectorâs share decreases slightly. In all three Scandinavian countries, the for-proï¬t providers are increasing their shares of the welfare employment faster than the nonproï¬ts. The gap between the sectors is growing fastest in Sweden, where the nonproï¬ts remain very small while the for-proï¬t share has doubled. This has resulted in a dramatic shift from the public sector to the for-proï¬t sector"

158,1,0.346,Microfinance 3.0 : Reconciling Sustainability With Social Outreach and Responsible Delivery,"Fifteen years ago, microfinance was looked upon as one of the most promising concept to lift poor people out of poverty. Microfinance was perceived to be âgood per seâ. Many institutions proved successful both in development and in financial terms. Today, after an impressive pushing of the âfinancial frontierâ, financial inclusion seems to have a mixed record: While it is true that many people in developing countries still lack access to finance, we have also witnessed the opposite âtoo much/easy accessâ led to overindebted clients, unable to serve their several microcredits offered by (too) many institutions. In some markets, this implied a move into pure consumer lending, partly replacing the traditional lending to micro-entrepreneurs. âGoodâ responsible microfinance institutions were not able to continue to operate in these âcontaminated marketsâ. In this context, the question (re-)emerged: isnât it, after all, unrealistic to believe that pursuing a development mission can go hand in hand with financial success, particularly in the context of commercial microfinance? I do not share this view. In fact, I believe the two goals are intertwined in the sense that without financial viability, clients cannot be served in a sustainable way, and that institutions which do not understand their clients with their financial needs will hardly be financially successful. However, this does not happen automatically: on the contrary, it takes a lot of efforts to achieve both objectives: a high degree of professionalism and a strong commitment to a responsible service delivery. It also takes responsible regulators and more efforts to promote financial literacy of clients. This book is part of a publication series initiated by KfW on selected topics in the field of financial systems development, one of the core competencies of KfW. This edition addresses the ethics of financial systems development which have been under scrutiny in âdevelopedâ markets as well as in developing countries. As âbankingâ seems to have become a questionable activity, we will take a special look at the institutions that provide microfinance services. âMicrofinance 3.0â intends to provide a new âframeworkâ for the future of microfinance which builds upon past success stories as well as upon lessons learnt from bad practices and errors. It contains nine contributions, written by different microfinance experts, distinguished practitioners as well as observers and analysts of microfinance for more than a decade. Some of these contributions were presented at the KfW Financial Sector Symposium in late 2012 in Berlin, where the future landscape of microfinance was discussed. These contributions touch upon some of the âingredients of âmicrofinance 3.0â: the values needed to provide financial services responsibly, the appropriate busi-"

Winter season natural gas usage has skyrocketed.

This was a period of innovation in mental health care across many developing countries, in which the WHO then sought out their guiding role. Following initial discussions on the organisation of mental health care, many of the psychiatrists who participated in regional and international conferences continued to seek out advocacy roles. In 1975, a more politically inclined Association of Psychiatrists in Africa changed its name to the Association of African Psychiatrists, reflecting both the increased number of indigenous-born psychiatrists on the continent as well as a desire for Observer status in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The notion of African psychiatrists having a unique perspective on the problems of mental illness in Africa was also reflected in the title of the Associationâs new African Journal of Psychiatry, of which Muhangi was Assistant Editor-in-Chief.74 In the longer term, however, African psychiatrists have contributed disproportionately little to research and policy within the field of international mental health. The Association of African Psychiatrists, along with its journal, collapsed in 1981 just as structural adjustment policies were starting to cripple health systems and universities, resulting in little time, funding and training for experiments or research. Reductions in travel allowances, combined with ongoing difficulties of staffing, have made it more difficult for psychiatrists to participate in conferences beyond national borders, and barriers to research and publication have resulted in relatively little research being published in international journals. While some psychiatrists continued to consult for the WHO, most did not, focusing on keeping psychiatry going within their own countries, often in difficult economic and political circumstances. Since the mid-1990s, most professional activity among psychiatrists has been limited to a regional sphere of influence. The Uganda Psychiatric Association has met for regular conferences since its formation in 1996. Psychiatrists in East Africa have met at annual scientific conferences since 1999, and a new and expanded African Association of Psychiatrists and Allied Professionals was formed in the early 2000s, starting with a meeting in Nairobi. Such activity, particularly since the early 2000s, suggests an important body of knowledge and experience that should play a central role in determining international, now global mental health policy, but which has nevertheless seen relatively little circulation outside of the continent.75"

By the end of the eighteenth century, however, ordinary people throughout Europe were far more likely to want to see suicide as the result of mental illness and to try to circumvent traditional, religious or legal requirements that suicides be denied normal burial.34 However, attitudes towards taking oneâs own life show considerable variation even in the eighteenth century and were affected by the circumstances of the suicide. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, suicide was considered a crime under both secular and canon law. Those who committed suicide in order to escape the justice of the State were double criminals. Since the means of death had been taken from the State, other forms of punishment were placed upon the suicide, foremost among which were post-mortem punishment of the body and forfeiture of the Estate. As Houston notes, forfeiture was âa token of blame and of âapologyââ, but the punishment of the body was both more shameful and more punitive.35 MacDonald and Murphyâs history of suicide records that the normal punishment for suicides until 1823 was forfeiture and profane burial. The 1823 Act ended the custom of profane burial for suicides, but it is noteworthy that profane burial was never a universal and legally enshrined rule: the 1823 act only put a stop to a local customary practice which had already fallen out of use in many parts of the country, as a more sympathetic attitude to suicides gained ground. In fact, Houston contends that profane burial in the form of highway burial with a stake through the body was predominantly a southeast English custom and that widely variable practices are described in provincial newspaper and legal accounts of the disposal of the suicideâs body. Houston notes, for example, that in 50 years of the Cumberland Pacquet only 3 of 18 suicides reported in the northern counties of England were linked to unusual burials: one staked at a crossroads, one on Lancaster Moor and one buried at Low Water mark. All three are from 1790â1791 and might 34 MacDonald and Murphy, Sleepless Souls. See also the essays in Jeffrey Watt (ed.)

We need to investigate methodologies for the accountability, because in the envisioned edge/fog computing environment, users can flexibly share their spare resources to host applications. The hybrid resource continuum from edge/fog to Cloud calls for studying dynamic pricing mechanisms, similar to the spot instance pricing from Amazon EC2 service2 . The ability of monitoring the elasticity of a system/application deployed in a large-scale, dispersed and multi-provider hybrid environment requires investigation. How to quantify and measure the elasticity of a complex distributed system? As regards elasticity, we can quantify its performance by considering the number of missing or superfluous adaptations over time, the durations in sub-optimal states, and the amount of over-/under-provisioned resources [35]. However, how to measure such quantities in a dispersed, large-scale environment with multiple providers turns out to be challenging. Similarly to Cloud computing, we need to identify (or develop) efficient business models that support and encourage the diffusion of trusted computing resources and the elasticity requirements for such business models. One of the most important challenge arises from the lack of central controlling authorities in the edge/fog computing environment, which makes it difficult to assert whether a device is hosting an application component. Security aspects are of key importance, because nowadays the value of data is very high and an infrastructure that does not guarantee stringent security properties will be hardly adopted. Similarly for the accountability issue, the decentralization of the emerging environment requires to deal with the lack of a central security authority. Sophisticated yet lightweight security mechanisms and policies should be introduced, so to create a disseminated trustworthy environment."

In spite of getting electoral support from these groups, many of the governments have later disqualiï¬ed or consciously attempted to co-opt some of them (Zibechi, 2010; Bowen, 2011), while new elites emerge.

31,47,0.327,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Towards a Typology of Harms For reasons of analytical clarity it is worth distinguishing between different orders of harm. â¢ First order intrinsic harms, which causally affect living persons and not dead bodies. The dead body, by virtue of being a corpse is beyond experiencing intrinsic harm of any order. â¢ First and Second order symbolic harms are either harms to the interests of those who once existed (first order symbolic harms to antemortem persons), or they are biographical harms that occur after death and to a posthumous reputation (second order symbolic harms). The FeinbergâPitcher thesis considers the first, but not the second. First order symbolic harms accrue to the transcendent interests of ante-mortem persons. Second order symbolic harms are harrmful post-mortem re-figurations of what once living persons interests were thought to be. They can be thought of as harms to memory and biography. Posthumous harms, moreoverâ are not free-floating, they accrue to a living subject bearer, normally in the form of a relative or friend who is concerned that the memory of their dead is not misrepresented. The living are witness to the fidelity of memory and its rightful conservation. They are surrogate interest bearers for the transcendant interests of those now dead. â¢ Second order intrinsic harms are intrinsic harms to significant others who are related to or care about the deceased and experience the hurt of how they are disremembered. They tend to be psychological harms and rely in a narrative investment about how someone ought to be remembered. Being disremembered causes psychological distress in those that invest truth in a certain memorial narrative. Most commonly, it may be experienced by survivors who hear others âspeaking illâ of their dead relatives or friends. More dramatically it may be experienced by a relative as a deliberate and intentional attempt to dishonour the dead and even to refigure their memory as particularly notorious. Usually disremembering the dead is expressed through the spoken or written word when this is not what they deserved. Second order intrinsic harms can be experienced by others as harm to the corpse itself. While it is not possible to harm a mouldering corpse in itself, the corpse has a symbolic unity for the living that needs to be respected, in particular by those who grieve âtheirâ"

In the ï¬rst two project years, three different managers were in charge with different attitudes towards the project and its implementation. In certain periods, the project was overshadowed by the companyâs business issues, and its objectives were put to the background. While the company owner together with Mr. Supportive drove the project, some managers perceived the project rather being vague than closely related to the concrete business model of the company. This resulted in some discrepancies in management. The management installed during the evaluation decided to foster the project implementation, but simultaneously to focus on factory operation, as it pursued cost cutting and similar measures as part of its crisis management. Furthermore, the owner moved to the background, as his daughter became part of the new management team. 4.4.3.4 Takeaways from the Case Company A and the regional IT consultancy project partner analyzed the project implementation and identiï¬ed a list of experiences and events that have had impact on the project results. Undoubtedly, the project has created the unique opportunity for both partners to develop innovative solutions, and the project implementation will be deï¬nitely useful for different types of production companies. Selected lessons learnt are presented subsequently. Continuously discuss the project progress with relevant stakeholders In the course of project implementation, Company A has experienced signiï¬cant changes on the management and worker level. For instance, due to the required increase of production efï¬ciency, a crisis manager was hired. New managers seemed not always to be committed to the project objectives. Therefore, they did not support the project implementation adequately. It is advisable to discuss continuously the project course with the management and more precisely present the project impact on the current as well as on future production. The same applies to workers.

In practice, a single transmitter and receiver pair can operate with a bandwidth of 10â20 GHz for transmission distances of some tens of kilometers. Optical amplifiers, which most commonly operate at wavelengths near 1550 nm, can be used to increase the range of transmission. In the modulation process, the power of the carrier is varied in proportion to the voltage of the signal. Because of this, the effect of small unwanted components in fiber transmission systems is greatly reduced. Consider, for example, a small component of the optical signal resulting from a reflection within the fiber. If the optical power of the reflected component is x dB less than that of the main component, then after demodulation at the photodetector, the signal power contributed by the reflected component is 2x dB less than that from the main optical component. This also applies to small unwanted effects resulting from finite isolation of couplers, isolators, and other elements. Variations in the frequency response resulting from standing waves in microwave transmission lines are significantly less in optical fiber than in cable. A feature that must be taken into account in applications of optical fiber is the dispersion in velocity, D, usually specified in ps.nm # km/!1 . The difference in the time of propagation for two optical wavelengths that differ by ""$ traveling a distance ` in the fiber is D""$`. Figure 7.3 shows the dispersion for two types of fiber. Curve 1 is for a type of fiber widely used in early applications, and curve 2 represents a design in which the zero-dispersion wavelength is shifted to coincide approximately with the minimum-attenuation wavelength of 1550 nm. This optimization of the performance at 1550 nm is achieved by designing the fiber so that the dispersion of the cylindrical waveguide formed by the core of the fiber cancels the intrinsic dispersion of the glass at that wavelength. Consider a spectral component, at frequency !m , of a broadband signal that is modulated onto an optical carrier. Amplitude modulation of the signal results in sidebands spaced Ë!m in frequency with respect to the carrier. Because of the velocity dispersion, the two sidebands and the carrier each propagate down the fiber with slightly different velocities and thus exhibit relative offsets in time at the receiving end. Such time offsets result in attenuation of the amplitude of the high-frequency components of analog signals and in broadening of the pulses used to represent digital data. Thus, for both analog and digital transmission, dispersion Fig. 7.3 Dispersion D in single-mode optical fiber of two different designs, as a function of the optical wavelength."
117,170,0.315,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"This example shows Leandra doing will-work. She wants to shower Ms Koch.16 In order to do this, she needs Ms Koch to want to shower, or at least to not refuse it. Leandraâs initial use of the generic âyouâ indicates that entering the room cheerfully is a more general way of approaching residents. But she then adjusts to the person herself and to the severity of the residentâs condition, as is evidenced in Ms Kochâs example. In other words, generalisations are not useful here. To get Ms Koch to want to shower, Leandra attempts to sculpt her mood. Although sometimes ânothing worksâ and wanting remains not amenable to Leandra to work upon it, sometimes it does work: in those situations, Leandraâs smile causes Ms Koch to âalso become cheerfulâ, to âmagnify the emotionâ and to relax. This, in turn, results in her allowing Leandra âto do moreâ, including giving her a shower. In another example of this way of doing will-work, Joani often brought three cups of hot chocolate to Ms Veenstra along with her medicine. We drank the chocolate by her bedside together. Meanwhile, we talked about the weather or what we had done yesterday, or about the joint breakfast awaiting her downstairs. By doing this, Joani hoped to get Ms Veenstra into the mood for getting out of bed, and it often worked. In those cases, what Ms Veenstra wanted was aligned with Joaniâs desire for her to have breakfast, and for her to be with others. Sculpting moods and emotions is one way to align wanting. Two important conclusions can be drawn from this. Firstly, the story affirms that moods and emotions cannot be separated from wanting.17 Secondly, it shows will-work as a relational practice: Ms Koch and Leandra are"

The utilitarian point of view is also reflected in the increased focus on skills and employability in the EC. In many countries, this debate is progressively becoming interlinked with the debate on quality and quality assurance (e.g. the Danish committee on quality and relevance of higher education). While there is clearly a link between quality of education and employability, there is also a great danger in establishing a simplistic and linear connection between the two. There is a real danger that the essential âbildungâ and the civic development aspects of higher education is overlooked if a purely utilitarian approach is adopted. If a simple and linear correlation is introduced, the process of diversiï¬cation of higher education, providing access to education to students from all backgrounds throughout a studentâs life is often disregarded. If the goals of permeability, diversiï¬cation and flexibility are ignored, then quality assurance can create conformity rather than innovation, and the overriding aim of creating a Europe of Knowledge for an increasingly diverse student population might be lost."
337,299,0.314,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"addressing interactions among individuals. The explicit attention for interactions between agents makes it possible for this type of model to simulate emergent properties of systems. These are properties at the macro scale that are not predictable from observing the micro units in isolation. If the decision rules of the agents are set such that they sufficiently look like human decision making they can simulate behavior at the meso-level of social organization, i.e. the behavior of heterogeneous groups of actors. Multi-agent-based models of land change are particularly well suited to representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions (Bousquet and Le Page 2004; Parker et al. 2003). Multi-agent systems are able to formalize decision-forming behavior of individual stakeholders, either based on theory (Happe et al. 2006), or based on observations and statistical analysis (Bousquet et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2007; Valbuena et al. 2010a). In the initial years of application of agent-based models to land change, most multi-agent models focused on either hypothetical or simplified representations of the real world to explore interactions between agents and between agents and the environment. Especially the parameterization of agent behavior in models for real case-studies turned out to be very complex. However, more recently a larger number of applications of agent-based models to real case studies worldwide have been published, showing the potential of the approach to explore the land change dynamics in local to regional level case studies (Le et al. 2012; Robinson et al. 2012; Valbuena et al. 2010b). At larger spatial scales, ranging from the region to the global level the principles of agent-based modeling have not yet been applied in simulation models, leaving most models at that level with highly simplified representations of human-environment interactions (Rounsevell and Arneth 2011). The possibilities for either upscaling or outscaling agent-based models have been described by Rounsevell and colleagues (Rounsevell et al. 2012), but have not yet been applied in operational models."

There are two versions of RSL: a weak one that is sound with respect to the C/C++11 memory model, which features out-of-thin-air reads, and a stronger one that is sound with respect to a variant of the C/C++11 memory that forbids load buffering. The weak version of RSL forbids relaxed writes completely, and does not constrain the value returned by a relaxed read. The stronger version provides singlelocation invariants for relaxed accesses, but its soundness proof relies strongly on a strengthened version of C/C++11 without po âª rf cycles (where po is program order, and rf is the reads-from relation), which forbids load buffering. When it comes to reasoning about coherence properties, even the strong version of RSL is surprisingly weak: it cannot be used to verify any of the coherence examples in this paper. In fact, RSL can be shown sound with respect to much weaker coherence axioms than what C/C++11 relaxed accesses provide. One notable feature of RSL which we do not support is read-modify-write (RMW) instructions (such as compare-and-swap and fetch-and-add). However,"

Such an open-ended statute was rejected by the Commission which wanted to prevent âarbitrariness of the judgesâ and demanded that the addition âetc.â shall be dropped.150 This last proposed amendment appears to be very signiï¬cant since it testiï¬es to the awareness of the representatives to the Parliament (âSejmâ) of the high value of strict interpretation of the legality principle, an attitude that was even going beyond the regulations of the Constitution of 1815, being itself still far from explicitly acknowledging the nullum crimen sine lege certa doctrine.

341,37,0.308,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"that project as regards the four main components of groundwater governance: actors, national legal frameworks, policies and information and knowledge. In addition, the authors address the issue of governance of transboundary groundwater resources and the relevant existing international legal frameworks. In conclusion, through a Global Vision for 2030, this chapter presents a way forwards to govern groundwater and a framework for action to achieve good governance, formulated by the Groundwater Governance Project jointly implemented by UNESCO, FAO, World Bank and IAH. To achieve the goals of the Shared Vision 2030, a Framework for Action has been developed. It describes the main steps to be taken, provides guidance on planning and prioritising actions and is an urgent call for action to all who can make a difference: national and local governments, international organisations, the private sector, civil society, media, educational institutions and professional organisations â but also well owners, groundwater users and concerned citizens everywhere. The main steps elaborated in the Framework for Action are understanding the context, creating a basis for governance, building effective institutions, making essential linkages, redirecting finances and establishing a process of planning and management. The Shared Global Vision for Groundwater Governance 2030 and the Global Framework for Action to achieve the vision on Groundwater Governance call for strengthening groundwater governance. This call for action urges countries, districts, communities, companies, organisations and individuals to safeguard the groundwater resource that is essential to meet their common future objectives and Sustainable Development Goals. This Framework for Action is designed to set in place the groundwater governance arrangements that will achieve this vision. Doug Merrey explores the likely trends and outcomes in water governance with a particular focus on cooperation and conflict over the management of water resources in two regions: South Asia and Southern Africa. With its extremely largescale shared river basins inhabited by nearly a billion mostly poor people, South Asia has struggled to find ways to co-manage water resources to benefit everyone equitably in a context where there is much potential benefit to be achieved. Southern Africa is considered an example of relative success in developing ways to cooperate â but implementation is incredibly complex in systems more water scarce than South Asia, though not as large. They examine the prospects for developing governance arrangements in the two regions through three âlensesâ which they characterise as âbeyond disciplinesâ, âbeyond scalesâ and âbeyond âinstitutionalâ hardware to âhumanâ softwareâ. Even those who have advocated for the role of institutions above, individuals have conceded, as noted for South Asia, that the behaviour of individuals within organisations determines the outcomes. More research needs to be conducted on the role of the individual in actively addressing complex waterrelated challenges, in redefining how multiple sectors cooperate around these issues and ultimately influencing socio-economic development at the regional level. At present, governance structures, organised nationally and transnationally on a basin scale in both regions, presume that âstakeholdersâ can adequately represent themselves in formal settings where allocation, use and management decisions are"

260,266,0.307,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"It is evident from the studies described here that anti-ranaviral immunity is multifaceted, complex, and likely species- and developmental stage-specific. Also evident are the many gaps in our understanding of the immune response to these pathogens as well as possible defects in the hostâs ability to mount effective responses that contain and eliminate these infections. It is particularly worrisome that Ranavirus and other genera within the family Iridoviridae have devised numerous, highly efficient strategies for evading, and even utilizing host immune components, to achieve persistence, facilitate dissemination and expand host range. Clearly, ranaviruses encode a large number of putative gene products, which represent both potential virulence factors as well as promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. While it is easy to dismiss lower vertebrate immune systems as functionally analogous to those of mammals, there is a growing literature suggesting otherwise. It is through the fundamental understanding of the physiological and ecological pressures governing these unique immune systems that we may begin to comprehend ranavirus infection strategies and the immune systems that may, or may not have adequately co-evolved to stop them. The investigation of ranavirus infection and immune subversion strategies should be approached not only by taking into account well-defined mammalian pathogens, but also by considering the possibility that ranaviruses may represent unique viral agents. In contrast to the majority of homeothermic vertebrate pathogens, ranaviruses are extraordinary in their ability to overcome cell and host tropism barriers, while their mechanisms of pathogenicity appear to be (at least partially) much less dependent on viral loads. Indeed, the immune systems of ectothermic hosts have evolved as the result of, and are subject to, different physiological and pathogenic pressures than those that have shaped the mammalian immune system. It stands to reason that ranavirus pathogens have co-evolved with these unique immune systems, thus we must garner greater insights into both to fully understand either.

Jinghe County lies within the Ebinur Lake catchment, and the two study villages are both within the county and within 50 km of the lakeâs shore. Given the low precipitation at the catchment floor of only 60â80 mm per year, the snowmeltfed lake and associated wetlands play an important role in sustaining the regional ecology.

As part of sedentarization, all households built permanent homes in their former autumn pastures and were allotted adjacent land for cultivation.

73,703,0.302,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"To climatologists, nutritional security is dominated by the impacts of weather and climate on food systems. With growing urbanisation around our metropolitan cities and regional centres, extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones impact directly on agriculture and on the logistical distribution of food. Drought affects human life and health as well as impacting dramatically on the sustainable development of society. It represents a pending danger for vulnerable agricultural systems that depend on the occurrence of rainfall, the security of water supply and the integrity of reservoirs. Developed countries are affected, but the impact is disproportionate within the developing world. Drought, especially when it results in famine, can change the life and economic progression of developing nations and stiï¬e their development for decades. A holistic approach is required to"
8,867,0.302,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","29.2 On Formation of QGP in Heavy Ion Collisions Maurice Jacob begins his presentation at 11:20, 22 June, 1982. âHeavy ion collisions offer the possibility to reach very high densities and very high temperatures over extended domains, many times larger than the size of a single hadron. The energy densities considered are of the order of 0.5â1.5 GeV/fm3 and the relevant temperatures are in the 200 MeV range. The great interest of reaching such conditions originates from recent developments in Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD, which make it very plausible that, while color confinement should prevail under standard circumstances, deconfinement should occur at sufficiently high density and (or) sufficiently high temperature. Under such conditions a new phase of matter, a quark-gluon plasma, is likely to exist. This phase should be viewed as due to a coalescence, or perhaps a percolation, of hadrons into larger entities and not as an actual separation of free quarks! . . . âOver an extended volume where the required density or temperature conditions would prevail, one expects that the properties of the physical vacuum would be modified. While the normal vacuum excludes the gluon field, the color-equivalent of the dielectric constant being zero (or practically zero), one would get a new vacuum state where quarks and gluons could propagate while interacting perturbatively. âThe equivalent of the dielectric constant would now be unity. The required conditions may be reached at high enough densities, hadrons being squeezed into one another, or at high enough temperature, the calculation of the partition function no longer favoring confining configurations whereby a color flux tube of fixed cross section extends between two color sources. The temperature at which the phase transition is expected to occur depends on the density, or on the quark chemical potential. One may thus separate two phases, a hadron phase and a quark gluon plasma, on a density-temperature diagram.. . . âThe presence of a phase transition could long be expected from phenomenological models with an exponentially increasing hadron spectrum. The limiting Hagedorn temperature, obtained as the specific heat of the hadron gas diverges, can"
176,131,0.301,Russia'S Turn To The East : Domestic Policymaking and Regional Cooperation,"In the years leading up to the conflict over Ukraine, oil prices were high, Western countries open to cooperation and foreign companies eager to invest in Russiaâespecially in the petroleum sector. Many Russian companies, including state-controlled oil and gas corporations, took on high levels of debt, based on the assumption that oil prices would remain high. After Crimea, Russia faced not only international sanctions but also a collapse in the price of oil. The combination of the lower oil price and sanctions left Russia economically and politically vulnerable, and potentially dependent on its biggest non-Western trading partner: China. After the introduction of Western sanctions, several major developments took place in Sino-Russian energy cooperation. In May 2014, the two countries reached a deal on the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline, with an estimated value of USD 400 billion (Overland et al. 2015, p.42). During the same year, imports of oil from Russia to China increased by 36 per cent, reaching 30 million tons (Cunningham 2015b). Oil exports from Russia even displaced other suppliers: in 2014, Chinese oil imports from Saudi Arabia fell by 8 per cent and from Venezuela by 11 per cent (Cunningham 2015a; see Fig. 6.1 for further details). This development was one important motivation behind Saudi Arabiaâs unexpected decision to raise oil production and lower the price of oil in 2014, despite the negative impact on Saudi revenues and on intra-OPEC solidarity. These developments create the impression that China was discreetly providing the financial backing for Russiaâs annexation of Crimea. While"

121,467,0.3,Becoming Citizens in a Changing World : IEA International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 International Report,"Civic and citizenship activities in classrooms and teacher preparation Chapter 2 of this report described the general approaches that the ICCS 2016 schools were taking to deliver civic and citizenship education in their classrooms. The chapter also reported principalsâ and teachersâ perceptions of the most important aims of this area of school education, and documented the types of pre-service and in-service training that teachers in the ICCS countries experience. In this section of the current chapter, we look at the activities carried out within participating schoolsâ classrooms during civic and citizenship education lessons from two perspectivesâstudentsâ and teachersâ. We also consider teachersâ responses to a question about their level of preparedness for teaching topics related to civic and citizenship education. The question in the ICCS 2016 student questionnaire on civic topics taught in school required students to indicate the extent to which they had learned about each of the following at their school: (a) âhow citizens can vote in local or national election;â (b) âhow laws are introduced and changed in <country of test>;â (c) âhow to protect the environment (e.g. through energy-saving or recycling);â (d) âhow to contribute to solving problems in the <local community>;â (e) âhow citizen rights are protected in <country of test>;â and (f) âpolitical issues and events in other countries.â We used these items to derive an IRT-based scale called civic learning at school. It had an average reliability across countries (Cronbachâs alpha = 0.80). The higher scale scores indicate higher levels of reported learning of civic issues at school. (For a description of this scale, see the item map in Figure 6.4, Appendix D.) On average across the participating countries, the highest percentages of students who said they had learned about the listed topics to a moderate or large extent were for how to protect the environment (81%), how citizens can vote in local and national elections (64%), and how citizen rights are protected in <country of test> (61%). The lowest percentages were for political issues and events in other countries (52%) and how to contribute to solving problems in the <local FRPPXQLW\!  6LJQLÄFDQWGLIIHUHQFHVHPHUJHGDFURVVWKHFRXQWULHVIRUDOOVL[WRSLFV VHH7DEOH 6.16), suggesting that students in different countries experience different degrees of emphasis on the civic-related topics they study at school. Table 6.16 also shows the national average scale scores for studentsâ learning of civic issues at school. Countries with the highest national average scale scores (three or more points above the ICCS 2016 average) were Chinese Taipei, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Peru. Those with the lowest national averages were Belgium (Flemish), Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands.

We also registered in most participating countries higher scale scores for students who anticipated completing a university degree. Here, the difference was two points on average across the participating countries. Students at or above Level B of civic knowledge scored higher than students below this level, with an ICCS average difference of three points."

As this species covers fairly the same niche as the European lobster and is also a high value seafood product on the market, it is another promising candidate that should be examined.

Clear positive effects on the potential of OWFs to function as refuge for ï¬sh and marine animals were observed for crustacean species such as brown crab (Cancer pagurus) due to increased opportunities for shelter and food availability (StelzenmÃ¼ller et al. 2016)."

The basic assumption herein is that the social web and Web 2.0 technologies allow scientists, on the one hand, to open up the research process and, on the other, to prepare the product of their research for interested non-experts (see Table 2). Accordingly, we recognize two different streams within the public school: The first is concerned with the accessibility of the research process (the production), the second with the comprehensibility of the research result (the product). Both streams involve the relationship between scientists and the public and define openness as a form of devotion to a wider audience. In the following section we will elaborate more on both streams in reference to relevant literature."

There is a 25.7 percent point difference in phone ownership between men and women in WHP compared with a 10.8 percent point difference in ENBP. Clearly, the relative social and economic status of women in the two provinces is reflected in phone ownership rates. These gender differences by provinces are also apparent in how the mobile phone is used and how frequently men and women make and receive calls and SMS messages. In matrilineal ENBP, women make and receive more calls than men, whereas in patrilineal WHP the reverse is the case and again the disparity between the genders is starker than in ENBP (Table 4). Similarly, in ENBP, women send more SMS messages than men and receive about the same number as men, while men from WHP send and receive more texts than women (Table 4). In summary, it seems that mobile phone technology is not yet contributing to a signiï¬cant erosion of the gender divide in WHP society. However, it is likely that mobile phone technology is empowering women by widening their social networks beyond their immediate communities by allowing them to maintain contact with relatives and friends living elsewhere. This is especially important for women in patrilineal societies when they move to the villages of their husbands and have limited contact with their natal relatives living elsewhere. It is also likely that the technology empowers women market sellers economically through, for example, enabling them to contact relatives in town to determine prices at local markets before committing to transporting garden produce to market. These beneï¬ts, of course, pertain more to women in accessible locations not far from urban markets who can respond quickly to such opportunities. Overall, however, when ENBP and WHP are compared it appears that the uptake and use of mobile phone technology reflects existing patterns of gender inequality. Women in matrilineal ENBP have much higher status in their society and this is reflected in their higher rate of mobile phone adoption and use relative to men, whereas in patrilineal WHP with an entrenched high level of gender inequity, men are clearly beneï¬ting far more from the new technology than women."

That failure still lies behind todayâs problems. When Japan was a developing country, the central government took the initiative in developing industries, which resulted in improved living standards of the people. Now Japan is one of the most advanced economies in the world, and the Japanese society is fully matured. Japan is now a âproblem-saddled advanced country.â We still do not see what Japan should become in the future nor which industries might help revitalize the economy and best position the country for a promising future.

We have no other choice than to clarify the issues, establish goals to solve them, and build an advanced society worthy of being called a role model for the world. This should be the right way for Japan to reconstruct itself. I believe that Japan has sufficient cutting-edge technology and cultural imagination to enable it to achieve its goals. New demand and a new economy will be created through seeking solutions to the complex problems that all advanced nations face in the twenty-first century.

As conditions worsen, a general movement of ï¬shing and ï¬shing/pastoral villages southward toward Fergusonâs Gulfâitself drying outâand around towns, in search of relief aid or survival opportunities, is likely. With no practical means of continued livelihood, hundreds of thousands of Turkana ï¬shers and pastoralists would face region wide hunger and conditions for disease epidemics. Cross-border conflict between these Turkana and their northern neighbors would sharply escalate, especially in the face of regional arms trafï¬cking. Northern and central Turkana protests and pleas for help have so far been ignored by the Kenyan government which continues to militarize the region."

Educational qualiï¬cations were grouped into three categories: low, mid, and high education, where low level of education is deï¬ned as pre-primary or primary level of education, and high refers to upper secondary level of education or above. For marital status, we distinguished between people who were âmarried or cohabitingâ, âdivorced, separated, or never marriedâ, or âwidowedâ. We decided to group the never married with those who are separated or divorced because the number of them with children is very low and it is possible that they used to live with a cohabiting partner. Preliminary analyses were also carried out considering marital history indicators such as the total number of marriages, binary indicators of previous widowhood and divorce, as well as the age at or the length of the latest marital disruption. All these indicators were not signiï¬cant; therefore, we present results on the marital status at the time of the interview only. Three geographical areas were considered (North, Centre, and South) based on the statistical partition proposed by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (www.istat.it). Wealth was measured using a dichotomised indicator of whether the respondent owned his or her house or not (regardless of whether they were mortgage-free). Similarly, economic resources were measured using a dichotomised indicator of whether the respondent perceived that their household was able to make ends meet with great difï¬culty or not. Employment history was measured by distinguishing between respondents who have/had ever done any paid work and those who never worked. As an additional control variable for the Italian familialistic context, we introduced in the model a variable measuring whether parents had weekly contact with their children. Our hypothesis was to test if family closeness buffers the association found between indicators of fertility histories and subjective health. No measures of previous health conditions were asked in the ISF, whereas SHARE collected several indicators of participantsâ recall of health in childhood (deï¬ned as by when respondents were born up to and including when they were 15 years old). In particular, we considered an indicator of early life poor health if respondents missed school for more than one month, whether they recall being conï¬ned to bed or home for more than one month, or whether they were in hospital for a month or more because of a health condition during childhood. Moreover, SHARE asks questions about the respondentsâ socio-economic conditions during childhood, and we considered two proxies of these conditions using information on whether the respondents were living with both natural parents at the age of 10, and whether they had enough books to ï¬ll one shelf or one or more bookcases in the household."

Realising that his crimes have been rumbled, Bernie hires a mobster to kill the two young men at a party he will host at his exclusive Long Island beach-house. However, instead the mobster has Bernie killed for having an affair with his wife. Excited about their weekend of partying at Bernieâs house, Larry and Richard arrive to find Bernie dead in his chair. Thus begins a black comedic narrative in which Bernieâs corpse retains its liveliness in many biological and social ways. Fearing that they will be suspected of Bernieâs murder, Larry and Richard delay informing the police. As Bernieâs house starts to fill up with partygoers they see that nobody realises that their quiet host, sitting on the couch in a pair of sunglasses, is actually dead. Rather, Bernieâs friends greet and kiss him, massage him, haggle with him, and treat him as a living person. Larry and Richard therefore decide to âpostponeâ Bernieâs death so that they might have a fun weekend. They respond to Bernieâs social liveliness by acting as his guardian, explaining to the others that he is drunk. Without ever being noticed, they carry him, move his limbs about, and speak for him when the need arises. It is quite remarkable how many social interactions the corpse has in the movie. Over the course of the weekend Bernie smokes, waves, and goes waterskiing; he is âmurderedâ a further two times by the mobster assassin (who comes to question his own sanity when Bernie wonât die); and even has sex with his mistress who visits the beach-house to find out why he had not been in touch. This prompts the immortal line: âThis guy gets laid more dead than I do alive!â. Even more remarkable is the fact that, despite the sweltering weather on Long Island, Bernieâs body does not decompose nor show any signs of rigor mortis. Weekend at Bernieâs demonstrates how forms of life and liveliness can continue beyond biological death if the person is still a part of social life. In this fantasy of death denial, the âwhenâ of Bernieâs death is not recognised by his friends and is pushed into a distant temporal horizon by the two young men so that they can enjoy themselves in his company. In an even more macabre turn of events, Bernieâs corpse is reanimatedâreally this timeâthrough voodoo magic in the sequel, Weekend at Bernieâs II (1993). In other words, corpses have power and social lives through their own actions/reactions and the actions/reactions or assumptions of living people."

This is necessary for robotic aircraft and other robotic vehicles. Airbags use an accelerometer that detects the rapid deceleration in the front-back direction that occurs when a car crashes. This causes an explosive expansion of the airbag. One can conceive of more applications for these components in cars. An accelerometer in the up-down direction can detect if the car has fallen into a pothole.

36,355,0.286,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"9.1 Introduction In late winter of 2007, biologists at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation encountered a macabre scene during their annual winter surveys of hibernating bats in caves and mines in northern New York State: heaps of dead bats piled on cave floors (Fig. 9.1) (Veilleux 2008). Bats were also seen flying out in the middle of winter onto the snowy landscape and the number of citizen reports of dead bats found in backyards was much higher than normal. A white fuzzy growth was observed on muzzles and wings of the few remaining live bats, which led to the name white-nose syndrome (WNS) (Veilleux 2008; Reeder and Turner 2008; Turner and Reeder 2009). WNS is now recognized as one of the most devastating wildlife epidemics in recorded history and has caused the death of millions of bats in eastern North America. The research and management response to WNS has been rapid and we know much more about WNS than when those first dead bats were observed in New York, although there is still a great deal about this wildlife disease that is yet to be resolved. The first evidence of WNS in North America is dated to a photograph taken by a caver at Howeâs Cave in 2006 (Turner and Reeder 2009). Howeâs Cave is a popular tourist attraction that receives hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, many of whom visit from other parts of the world. The white fuzzy growth visible on bats is caused by a pathogenic fungus, which was described as Geomyces destructans (Gargas et al. 2009; Blehert et al. 2009), but was recently re-named Pseudogymnoascus destructans after closer evaluation of its taxonomic allies (Minnis and Lindner 2013). The fungus infects the skin tissues, including the wings and tail membranes, and causes bats to arouse too frequently from torpor"

If blue energy is a key aspect of blue growth, which is in turn a key aspect of the EUâs Integrated Maritime Policy, why is it not given the same importance across all the EUâs policies and strategies? Thus, for example, in the Energy Union Package contained in the Commissionâs 2015 Communication concerning a Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, there is no specific section devoted to blue energy: in fact, it does not even deserve a mention,58 the principal focus being the diversification of supply as far as suppliers and transport routes are concerned in order to guarantee energy security. The most innovative vision of the future to appear in the document would appear to relate more to exploring the full potential of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rather than to renewable energies.59 In a similar vein, the 2015 concept paper Project in Support to the Development of Blue Economy and Integrated Maritime Policy in the Black Sea, referred to earlier, in reality revolves around promoting tourism.60 Much the same can be said of the most recent revision of the Black Sea Synergy, carried out in 2015 through the afore-mentioned Joint Staff Working Document, which also makes no mention whatsoever of blue energy and deals only with hydrocarbon deposits or recent and future gas pipeline projects.61 In light of all the above, the EU could do worse in the future than to turn the spotlight on renewable energies in the various sea basins, of which the Black Sea is one, and thus by extension on blue energy, in order to improve consistency between all its different actions and instruments. Another challenge that the EU can undoubtedly do much to help overcome is that of spatial planning, in order to plan when and where human activities take place at sea. Maritime spatial planning reduces conflicts, encourages investment, increases coordination not only between administrations in each country but also between countries and protects the environment by helping with the early identification of impact and opportunities for multiple use of space.62 After the adoption of the Directive on maritime spatial planning, Member States are obliged to establish"

Based on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) banking statistics and information on borrowers from US MMF holdings, it is revealed that in the run-up to the GFC, MMFs in the US were the base of the shadow banking system, recycling wholesale funding to US borrowers via the balance sheet capacity of banks, especially European banks. The amount owed by banks to US prime MMFsâbased on the top 10 prime MMFsârepresented $755 billion of the approximate $1.66 trillion total in prime MMF assets, classified by nationality of the borrowing bank (Fig. 2.2). US prime MMFs nearly bailed out completely from the European Union (EU) periphery as of the second half of 2011, as a snapshot of the dollar amounts by nationality of borrowing banks on 30 June 2011 makes clear (Fig. 2.3). How gross flows net out is shown in Fig. 2.4, which plots US gross capital flows by category. Positive quantities (and bars) indicate gross capital inflows (the increase in claims of foreigners on the US), while negative quantities indicate gross capital outflows (the increase in claims of US residents on foreigners). The gray-shaded bars indicate the increase in claims of official creditors on the US. This includes the increase in claims of the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) and other current account surplus economies. While official flows are large, private sector gross flows are larger still. The negative bars before 2008 indicate large outflows of capital from the US (principally through banks), which then re-enter the economy through purchases of nonTreasury securities. We can gain additional insights on the nature of the gross capital flows through the banking system by following interbank claims of foreign banks operating in the US."

255,233,0.283,Railway Ecology,"Conclusions Our results provide a ï¬rst picture of the avian response to the presence and operation of HSR trains. Although the observed trends are not particularly prominent and are diluted by seasonal and inter-annual variability, they are consistent with the notion that train circulation could be responsible for a decrease in bird abundance in the traversed area. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the presence of the HSR has led to a process of ruderalization characterized by the increased numbers of species taking advantage of the railway. Some bird species representative of open and agricultural areas were found to avoid the HSR, whereas species that use man-made structures were found to be attracted to it. In fact, we documented the active use of these new elements, mainly the embankments and the catenary, by birds. In addition, birds alter their flight patterns near the railway, including showing some avoidance of it. However, birds risk train collision because such avoidance is not complete. Moreover, the species that are most exposed to train collisions are those that respond favorably to the railway and use its associated"

214,390,0.283,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Different strategies can be used to better quantify the different types of uncertainty in climate model projections. One of the best, which can be used for quantifying all three types of uncertainty, is to run ensembles, or multiple simulations. These simulations are typically done to gauge one kind of uncertainty, but they can be appropriately mixed and matched to understand all three types of uncertainty. The use of ensembles is now also common in weather forecasting. Weather forecasting suffers from model uncertainty and especially initial condition uncertainty, but usually not scenario uncertainty as we have described it. However, sometimes external events such as ï¬re smoke can signiï¬cantly affect the weather. In weather forecasting, ensembles of a forecast model are typically run in parallel: multiple model runs at the same time. Then the spread of results of these parallel runs is analyzed. The simulations usually differ from each other by perturbing the initial conditions (slight variations in temperature, for example) and/or by altering the parameters in the model. Sometimes forecasters consult different models, creating another sort of ensemble. Altering initial conditions tests the initial condition"

Second, when thinking about pitch perception of unresolved complex tones in terms of interaction between envelope and fine structure, it appears that the limitation of phase locking is probably much less critical than when thinking in terms of fine structure only. In fact, it seems clear that there is no need to encode every phases of the signal to encode the most intense phases located nearby an envelope maximum. This explains that the simulation can extract a periodicity related to pitch when the carrier frequency is over 10 kHz (Fig. 3)."

Embracing a holistic Earth system Science approach, we experiment since 2004 different stimulating educational/communicative model which emotionally involves the participants to raise awareness on the social dimension of the disaster hydrogeological risk reduction, pointing out that human behavior is the crucial factor in the degree of vulnerability and the likelihood of disasters taking place. The implementation of strategies for risk mitigation must include educational aspects, as well as economical and societal ones. Education is the bridge between knowledge and understanding and the key to raise risk perception. Childrenâs involvement might trigger a chain reaction that reinforce and spread the culture of risk. No matter how heavy was the rain that hit our land in the past and recent seasons, we still are not prepared. If on one hand we need to ï¬ght against worsening Global Warming that trigger extreme meteorological events, we should also work on sustainable land use and promote landscape preservation. Since science can work on improving knowledge of phenomena, technology can provide modern tool to reduce the impact of disasters, children and adults education is the flywheel to provide the change. We present here two cases selected among the wide range of educational activities that we have tested and to which more than 2,000 students and adults have participated within a period of 12 years. They include learn-by-playing, hands-on, emotional-learning activities, open questions seminars, learning paths, curiosity-driven approaches, special venues and science outreach. Keywords"

The role of the facilitator is therefore markedly different in each case, either attending to the kind of thing being said (e.g., is it an evaluation or is it a description of detail?), with less attention on the content (Coles); or attending to the content of what is said (e.g., does it display awareness of the complexity of teaching and learning?), with less attention to issues around whether it is offered judgmentally or not (Chesnais and Horoks). It was clear from the Workshop that both ways of working have affordances and constraints.

10,104,0.282,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"et al. 2012; Bressers et al. 2013, 2015). The structural context influences the process not only through its direct contents, but also through its extent and coherence (Knoepfel et al. 2001, 2003; Bressers and Kuks 2004). The extent refers to the completeness of the regime. The coherence is the degree to which the various elements of the regime are strengthening rather than weakening each other. Regimes with an insufï¬cient extent are by deï¬nition weak as guardians of sustainable use of water resources, while some relevant parts of the domain go unregulated. Most of the time, growing complexity is an answer to real needs and developments. As a matter of fact, societies in modern times have generally grown into a situation of increased complexity. Increased populations, borders, overlaps, activities, rivalries, etc. are a fact of our current living environments. A growing complexity in governance can be viewed as a logical adaptation to that development (Gerrits 2008; Teisman et al. 2009). Many external change agents, such as technological developments, add new scales, new actors, new problem perceptions, new instruments, and new responsibilities to the existing ones. The essence of extent is not the number of involved scales, actors, perceptions, instruments and resources as such, but rather the degree to which these are complete in reflecting what is relevant for the policy or project. In that sense it should not be mistaken for another way of making a descriptive inventory like with the descriptive questions. By coherence we mean the following: When more than one layer of government is dealing with the same natural resource (as is often the case), then coherence means inter alia that the activities of these layers of government are recognised as mutually dependent and influencing each otherâsâ effects. Likewise if more than one scale is relevant the interaction effects between those scales should be considered. When more than one actor (stakeholder) is involved in the policy, coherence means that there is a substantial degree of interaction in the policy network, and preferably productive interaction providing coordination capacity. When more than one use or user is causing the problem of unsustainable resource use for example, coherence means that the various resulting objectives are analysed in one framework so that deliberate choices can be made if and when goals and/or uses are conflicting. When the actors involved have problem perceptions that start from different angles, coherence means that they are capable of integrating these to such an extent that a common ground for productive deliberation on ambitions is created. The same holds for instrumental strategies that are used to attain the different objectives, as well as for the different instruments in a mix to attain one of these objectives. Coherence of the organisation of implementation means that responsibilities and resources of various persons or organisations that are to contribute to the application of the policy are co-ordinated, or these actors themselves are co-ordinated. In the implementation process, the additional fragmentation that is typical for complex but non coherent regimes will tend to lead to more discord between the actors (goals), more uncertainty (cognitions), and more stalemates (power) and, thereby, can hamper implementation. In the implementation process, coherence of the structural context (the regime) will tend to lead to less discord (due to more âwin-winââsolution creativity), less (subjective) uncertainty (due to more exchange of information and less distrust) and less stalemates (due to less possibilities for"

86,121,0.278,Nuclear Back-End and Transmutation Technology For Waste Disposal : Beyond The Fukushima Accident,"The accelerator is the driver of MYRRHA because it provides the high-energy protons that are used in the spallation target to create neutrons, which in turn feed the core. In the current design of MYRRHA, the machine must be able to provide a proton beam with energy of 600 MeV and an average beam current of 3.2 mA. The beam is delivered to the core in continuous wave (CW) mode. Once per second, the beam is shut off for 200 Î¼s so that accurate on-line measurements and monitoring of the subcriticality of the reactor can take place. The beam is delivered to the core from above through a beam window. Accelerator availability is a crucial issue for the operation of the ADS. A high availability is expressed by a long mean time between failure (MTBF), which is commonly obtained by a combination of overdesign and redundancy. In addition to these two strategies, fault tolerance must be implemented to obtain the required MTBF. Fault tolerance will allow the accelerator to recover the beam within a beam trip duration tolerance after failure of a single component. In the MYRRHA case, the beam trip duration tolerance is 3 s. Within an operational period of MYRRHA, the number of allowed beam trips exceeding 3 s must remain under 10. Shorter beam trips are allowed without limitations. The combination of redundancy and fault tolerance should allow obtaining a MTBF value in excess of 250 h."
356,362,0.278,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Lessons Learned Given the length of the iTEC project (4 years), it was inevitable that priorities changed, both as a result of internal and external drivers. Furthermore, the design of the project with five overlapping cycles of development, piloting and evaluation created challenges. For example, before Cycle 1 had been evaluated, Cycle 2 was at its midpoint and Cycle 3 had already begun. While formative data were shared with relevant stakeholders in iTEC, the extent to which the evaluation findings were able to input into the development of the project was more limited than might otherwise have been the case. Future large-scale pilots should take this into account and ensure that feedback can be informative and useful. As with most evaluations, resource constraints were an issue. As the project developed, the number of themes and issues which needed to be covered in the evaluation extended, meaning additional tasks had to be added which had not been anticipated at the start of the project. Whilst adopting a responsive, flexible approach, it was not possible to evaluate all aspects of this complex project thoroughly. Whilst impossible to predict changes over time it would be helpful to prempt where possible and identify which aspects should be prioritised. Regular reviews of the aims and scope of the evaluation would be beneficial. A further tension was the need to evaluate both project processes and outcomes. Again, resource constraints meant at certain points, strategic decisions needed to be made about where resources would best be focused and this could be built into a review process from the outset."

119,328,0.277,Contemporary Issues in Human Rights Law : Europe and Asia,"pillars of economy, political-security and socio-cultural of ASEAN.â62 The deputy Secretary-General for ASEAN socio-cultural community, Alicia R. Bala, pointed out that âthe role of ASEAN Secretariat is critical in making gender mainstreaming as a standard practice in ASEANâs policies and programmes across the three pillars.â She then added that âbefore we are able to effectively stimulate gender mainstreaming strategy in ASEAN, we ï¬rst need to understand clearly the concept of gender equality and how gender mainstreaming strategy can be applied in our work.â63 With regard to speciï¬c initiatives and legal instruments adopted to promote womenâs rights, ASEAN established in 2010 the Commission on the promotion and protection of women and childrenâs rights (ACWC). The nature of the Commission is intergovernmental, being composed of two representatives from each ASEAN country. According to its terms of reference, its mandate is to promote âthe implementation of international instruments, ASEAN instruments and other instruments related to the rights of women and childrenâ (para. 5.1), and âto develop policies, programs and innovative strategies to promote and protect the rights of women and children to complement the building of the ASEAN Communityâ (para. 5.2). Despite acknowledging the importance of a cooperative approach to enhance women and childrenâs rights, the act recognises âthe primary responsibility to promote and protect the fundamental freedoms and rights of women and children rests with each Member Stateâ (para. 3.5). This clause seems to protect the position of countries, such as Brunei, that allow forms of discrimination against women based either on religion or on culture. The Commission presents an annual report to the ASEAN Ministers meeting on social welfare and development. The Commission has played a central role in promoting effective implementation of common issues in the CEDAW and in the 1989 Convention on the rights of the child, however it presents some weaknesses. The ï¬rst one concerns its composition: independent experts would better guarantee the promotion of womenâs rights, since there would be no influence on their activity by national governments. The second limit regards its mandate, which does not include either the elaboration of reports on each ASEAN or the analysis of individual complaints. Effective implementation of international provisions requires the possibility for individuals to obtain compensation for alleged violations of their rights.64 Whether the national system is weak in that respect, a regional independent mechanism could help in pursuing the promotion of human rights. The ACWC drafted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and Violence against Children in ASEAN, which was then adopted by the"

According to âVideo Game Revenue Forecast: 2017-22â, it is expected that the global market of video games will grow up to $174 billion by 2022 [1]. Traditionally, computer games are downloaded from the Internet and installed on a PC or other end user device allowing players to run the corresponding game. With game sizes running into multiple gigabytes, the installation process may take the order of hours, with perhaps additional time required to install patches of new game versions. Furthermore, when players wish to play newly released games, they may require a higher speciï¬ed hardware conï¬guration to enable all the visual effects, and so they have to upgrade their computers to meet the particular speciï¬cation. Both of these factors can result in frustration and may result in gamers give up the game [2]. Â© The Author(s) 2018 I. Ganchev et al.

Only 3 % of Beirutâs surface area is allocated for parks, a percentage that is far below the World Health Organizationâs recommendations. This 3 % includes playgrounds and urban forests and represents 0.8 m2 per resident. In order to reduce marginalised pockets and social disparity and in order to pave the way for new immigrants to integrate more easily, we used the park as a ï¬exible relational device between natural and artiï¬cial materials, processes, parts of the city and parts of the campaign. We divided the peri-urban area into three sections: the Narh Beirut river banks, the residential neighborhood of Haddat and the industrial/airport area of Hay al Selloum and we chose the river land as an area of intervention. The river has become an appetising object of attraction for future development, gentriï¬cation, and delocalisation of exiting activities and inhabitants and, we felt, necessary to our contribution in terms of research project. In 1968 the Nahr Beirut River was converted from a perennial river to a concrete canal and eventually mutated into an open sewer. The highway built on its right bank completed this conversion into an infrastructural conduit of sewage and transport (Frem 2009)."

However, the gap between agile and non-agile firms and farms will be exacerbated. Finally, public research will be needed to support development and dissemination of technologies to adapt to, mitigate and slow migrating weather impacts. One possible outcome is migration of crop production associated with specific weather. For example, production of certain dry wine varieties requires specific weather patterns. Increased heat may increase sugar content and may harm the ability to maintain wine quality. One solution may be to relocate production of grapes to another region (e.g. from California to Oregon). The production of wine also involves processing and shipping of grapes by wineries. Wineries have invested a lot in infrastructure and have recognized brand names. For instance, some of the reputation of wine is location-specific (e.g. high quality Bordeaux wine is produced only in Bordeaux). Thus, migration of weather may lead to migration of infrastructure and changes in regional and brand reputation, but also provide opportunities for other brands to grow or shift. This will be a special challenge for denomination by locality/terroir, for example of cheeses and wines. Response by growers will vary. Growers in areas with warming weather may adapt their practices on-site to maintain location and quality, while other growers will shift location (such as wine production moving from Napa to Oregon). Further, with a migration of supply location, there may be a decline in terroir branding and a shift to marketing by variety (e.g., Cabernet) rather than by region, and an increasing importance of brand rather than location. This can induce further concentration in formerly location-bound industries as companies with good R&D, branding and scale make alliances with growers in developing countries for contracted production of intermediate inputs based on detailed specifications. Of course to some extent this already occurs in commodity olive oil or wine, such as with Italian producers buying olives and grapes, first processed, from Eastern Europe and North Africa. This is also part of a larger trend where food industry companies source commodities (cheap bulk intermediate inputs) and market differentiated products, such as Smithfield Foods does in Europe by sourcing cheap pork from Eastern Europe and marketing quality branded products in France and Spain. Large organizations that are aware of the differential impact of weather patterns that worsen productivity of certain regions (e.g. southern China), while increasing it in other regions (e.g. northern China), may invest and hold land resources to later build infrastructure for new agricultural production. Such behavior requires the ability to predict spatial differences in the evolution of climate change over time; that ability is still limited. However, as our understanding of patterns of climate change develop, we are likely to see more speculative investments in regions that may benefit from climate change. For instance, the projected water depletion/shortage in the Middle East is leading investors from those countries to buy land swaths in well-watered regions, such as in sub-humid Africa. Given technological change in agricultural production processing and transport, weather migration may prompt more rapid transition to a modernized agricultural system as older facilities are retired. In this case, adaptation to climate change will"

It is closely related to software development lifecycle. More abstract (informal) concepts mature into concrete formal state. From certain point, there is homomorphic mapping between elements of development artifacts (class models, sources) downstream of the lifecycle (e.g. design level class may map 1:1 to implementation class model). However the level of detailed ness and formalization rises as it approaches implementation. Pattern instances can be also transformed (mapped) through the lifecycle. In current practice, patterns that are instantiated at any point of the software lifecycle, pass only implicit pattern instance to subsequent stages of the cycle. Explicit pattern instance if any doesn't pass to later stages. For example patterns are instantiated in the design model of the software and code is generated from participating classes. But code generator, virtually, takes only the implicit pattern information into account -valuable explicit information created with CASE tool is lost and/or incomprehensible for code generator. It would be beneficial to have persistent pattern instance through the software lifecycle (e.g. it could enhance code generation). However standardize carrier of the pattern instance data has to be employed.

The 2007 Communication offers a variety of technical and political initiatives to mitigate the impacts of water scarcity and drought (Estrela and Vargas 2012). As part of the policy, the 2007 Communication put forth an initial set of policy options to address the challenges related to water scarcity and drought, with special emphasis on pricing, land use planning and water-saving (Kampragou et al. 2011). The 2007 Communication also sets out a number of policy options addressing to increased drought frequencies as a result of climate change (Quevauviller 2014). The Communication also indicated the need for prioritization of drought risk management plans, the expansion of the European Drought Observatory, and a more rigorous use of the EU Solidarity Fund (Kampragou et al. 2011). The 2007 Communication on Water Scarcity and Droughts also address water pricing policies, advocating for âputting the right price tag on waterâ, âallocating water more efï¬cientlyâ and âfostering water efï¬cient technologies and practicesâ.

359,263,0.274,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Dynamics of the Brain","Computers A decade or two ago, the idea that an inestimable number of simultaneous non-linear equations could represent a theory of brain organization, if dreamt of by a few, seemed such an unlikely proposition that it merited no more than a passing frisson. There were two fundamental problems: how to make the calculations, and how to amass the data on which to make them. The first problem is largely solved, at least in principle and partly in practice. The most powerful super-computers currently available are at the peta-flop level (http://www.top500.org/list/2013/06/). The IBM roadmap predicts the production of an exascale computer around 2018 (1  1018 flops/s). Extrapolating todayâs Blue Brain Project numbers, exascale is probably the minimum required to simulate the entire brain. This level of performance is just sufficient for the simultaneous computation of the present estimate of the number of equations needed to provide a first holistic version of a brain model, one that instantiates the nonlinear interactions that give rise to the emergent properties of living brains. As to data storage, this is a practical problem that has effectively been solved by cloud computing and distributed storage with appropriate addressing; it is data analysis and aggregation with efficient database queries that are challenges at this scale."

Few approaches have been proposed to solve the SFC composition stage so far. Mehraghdam et al. [7] formulate a context-free language for formalizing chaining requests. They propose a greedy heuristic that tries to minimize the total data rate of the resulting chain by composing first the VNF that reduces the data rate of the flows in each step. Recently, Beck and Botero [1] proposed a scalable recursive heuristic that, at each step, composes a VNF in the service chain and, at the same time, embeds it in the substrate network (SN) trying to rapidly find a feasible solution. Most of the existing NFV-RA approaches deal just with the embedding stage as they consider the VNF-FG as a given input of the problem [5]. For instance, Bari et al. [4] propose exact Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic based approaches trying to minimize the OPEX caused by the SFC embedding. Also, Elias et al. [3] formulate the SFC embedding as a non-linear integer optimization model where the objective function is to minimize the network congestion. The aforementioned review shows that, up to now, little research has been performed in the composition stage of the SFC problem. Current solutions are heuristic-based and no optimal solution for the problem has been proposed so far. An optimal solution results in the best possible composition of the service chain with regard to a predefined objective. In this paper, we propose an optimal approach to solve the problem based on Integer Linear Programming."

241,634,0.271,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"10.3.2.4 Weather Generators Stochastic weather generators are statistical models producing high-resolution local-scale time series of a suite of elements such as temperature and precipitation among others, whose large-scale statistics follow the required criteria (Richardson 1981; Wilks and Wilby 1999; Olsson et al. 2009; Willems and Vrac 2011). Among many applications, they can serve as a computationally effective tool to produce site-speciï¬c data sets at the required time resolution (Semenov et al. 1998). The distribution used is usually different for different climate variables. For temperature, the normal distribution is the most popular (Semenov et al. 1998). More complicated is the generation of precipitation data, and different functions are used. Among the most popular are the Markov chain, the semi-empirical, and the NeymanâScott rectangular pulse (NSRP) weather generator. In the Markov chain generator, precipitation occurrence and totals are produced separately (Sunyer et al. 2012). Two states are possible: wet or dry days. The amount of precipitation on a rainy (wet) day is most often generated using a gamma or exponential distribution (Benestad 2007). In the semi-empirical generator, a few distributions can be deï¬ned, for instance for wet and dry spell lengths and precipitation amount. In the NSRP weather generator, Kilsby et al. (2007) proposed four different steps. A storm origin is described by the Poisson process. Separate rain cells within a storm are separated by time intervals taken from exponential distribution. The duration and intensity of each rain cell are also described by exponential distributions, and their sum gives a rainfall total. Weather generators can be used when the observation records are relatively short. They can also supply many weather ârealisationsâ having the same overall statistics. A wide suite of statistics can be used to ï¬t the model: mean, variance, skewness, autocorrelation, and many others. Weather generators can also serve to produce data for locations where there is information about the statistical distribution and time structure. For places with only short records of high-temporal-resolution data but longer series with data of low resolution, it is possible to use information from the longer records to make inferences about the distributions, and it is in principle possible to produce projections for temporal scales higher than those usually produced by RCMs (6 h). 10.3.2.5 Randomisation Models generally underestimate the local-scale variance. To resolve this, Karl et al. (1990) proposed the use of a scaling factor to ensure that the variance of the projected surface values will match the observed variance. But this could"

132,259,0.269,AiREAS: Sustainocracy for a Healthy City: Phase 3: Civilian Participation â Including the Global Health Deal Proposition,"status and wealth. Cities became conglomerates of the exchange of goods and public events. The impressive growth of cities over time, especially over the last few decades, shows how much time the local executives had to spend developing the ï¬rst and second infrastructural layers of their regions. In the following videos, one can get an idea of the expansion of such places, which now house many millions of residents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WGPvWPpey8&list=PLzYZm159uzQNc7H 5UCCXHx4c4TKdCeaNt. The combination of an influx of people and the mentality of survival in an era of greed for those who had to deal with the cityâs ï¬nancial reality made cities a hotspot of vulnerability, pollution and all sorts of illegal (and legal) criminality. The need for regulation and control was already visible in the early 19th century, but became even stronger when the consequences developed exponentially. With regulation and control, we see government grow in the responsibility and costs needed to address both infrastructure and behavior at the same time. Level 3 (Smart City) hence became an instrument for government ofï¬cials to further extend their control systems and try to let technology help in planning the cityâs short- and long-term evolution. Cities had become very vulnerable due to their dependence on resources from outside the city itself that were only accessible through the power of the concentration of wholesale and the availability of money. Basic needs such as food, water, building resources, energy supplies, etc., all became economized, while jobs in the city mainly related to the distribution of goods, semi-government (education, police, health care, maintenance, infrastructure, control) and real estate. Increasingly, people were entertained with events and kept docile through social securities. At the same time, in many large cities, sub-communities developed within the chaos of poverty, greed and indifference, forming ghettos and social inequality. Financially, a city needs huge amounts of money to develop, and this money comes from taxes, government services, sales of property, etc. But this is often not enough, and ï¬nancial debt grows exponentially. Speculation develops into inflation, which becomes known as the economy of growth. This growth can then be taxed again, giving the relative impression that the city is getting richer, but at the same time, both the costs of society and moral (and real) poverty rise even faster. In reality, the region gets poorer and poorer, but the story is told differently by political and economic interests. It ï¬nally becomes important for the city that responsibilities be shared. In Eindhoven, after the recognition of vulnerability due to the dependence on large industries that had moved into low wage areas, the idea of the Triple Helix developed. The Triple Helix involves the three pillars of the old money-driven society: government, education and business development. These enter into cooperation in an attempt to optimize local resources, develop innovations together and implement Smart technological solutions to manage the city effectively. The human being is still out of the picture, as real estate, speculation and technology prevail."

118,648,0.268,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"19.7 Regarding Public Communication as a Form of Professionalism Because nuclear engineering is fundamentally based on the integration of the technical with the institutional, and based on interpretation of discussions at the Summer School by the both the third generation and expert lecturers, in terms of professional responsibilities, routine communication with the public by nuclear engineers must be improved. This problem is derived directly from this absence of âface to faceâ interaction of the nuclear engineer with the âclientâ. In terms of general communication issues, some nuclear engineering topics may be reported in the news, but these are usually when accidents, or potential accidents, occur. This is not a condemnation of the media and reporting practices. Most of the daily news is largely negative in terms of subject matter. Nuclear engineering is one of the subjects that suffers probably more than others, due to historical inertia, in that it is perceived mostly negatively normally. When accidents occur, this usually reinforces the negative public opinion. Conveying accurate information regarding nuclear engineering issues is also very difficult even for those trained in the profession, and further underscores the need for the nuclear engineer to realize that part of the professional responsibility involves public communication. As an example, based on first-hand observation, in the weeks following the Fukushima Daiichi accident, news crews from ABC, NBC, and CBS frequently interviewed the faculty Department of Nuclear Engineering at UC-Berkeley for technical communication about the accident and related events [6]. However, even this level of communication flows only in one direction, as the nuclear engineer basically just tells the interviewer the state of the subject at hand. This is needed and it is important to do, but a deeper level of public interaction is required, where both the nuclear engineering professional and the public can see one another as both part of the society. Therefore, without regular and direct interaction, or failing to realize that the profession must include some level of this, is an encroachment on professional responsibilities. This is not to place the âburden of proofâ on the public to motivate themselves to hold a more positive attitude regarding nuclear engineering; indeed, this burden is part of the professional responsibility of the third generation nuclear engineer to develop ways that public interaction can be increased. Meaningful public interaction has been a challenge since the inception of nuclear engineering and drawbacks to this are related to its historical inertia. This has led many times to an âus versus themâ mentality which only fosters antagonism. This has historically shown to be the wrong approach. This can occur when"

Die Haftungsfragen wurden insgesamt bei Heise online am stÃ¤rksten kontrovers diskutiert, wÃ¤hrend auf US-amerikanischer Seite in den wenigen Aussagen zu diesem Thema alle Schreibenden die Haftung kÃ¼nftig beim Hersteller sehen. Die Autoren von Kommentaren in der Gruppe von Spiegel Online und Co., also bei den deutschen Massenmedien, finden dagegen mehrheitlich (58 Prozent), dass auch in Zukunft die Haftung bei der Halterin oder dem Halter des Fahrzeugs liegen sollte. Der Grundton der Kommentare auf den deutschen Portalen ist insgesamt etwas positiver: Sowohl auf Heise online als auch in den Foren der anderen Medienportale werden hÃ¤ufiger als auf den US-amerikanischen Medienportalen positive Eigenschaften des autonomen Fahrens thematisiert (70 Prozent und 71 Prozent gegenÃ¼ber 61 Prozent) und gleichzeitig weniger negative Bewertungen vorgenommen (37 Prozent und 48 Prozent gegenÃ¼ber 53 Prozent). 29.4.2.4 Zusammenfassung In den US-amerikanischen ebenso wie in den deutschen Leser-Kommentaren, die auf den Massenmedien-Portalen verfÃ¼gbar waren, Ã¼berwiegen Aussagen, die derzeit noch stark an den erwarteten Eigenschaften der autonomen Fahrzeuge selbst orientiert sind. Das heiÃt, das Akzeptanzobjekt ist in der Tat das physische Objekt Auto und seine individuelle Nutzung. Auf Heise online stellt sich dies anders dar â die Diskussionen gehen bereits weit Ã¼ber die Orientierung am rein âTechnischenâ hinaus und thematisieren konkrete Nutzungsszenarien bzw. sehen autonomes Fahren stÃ¤rker in Zusammenhang mit dem gesamten sozio-technischen System der (Auto-)MobilitÃ¤t. Da die meisten Schreibenden auf diesem Portal offensichtlich bereits Ã¼ber mehr Wissen in Bezug auf die Technologie verfÃ¼gen als ânormaleâ Medienrezipienten, kann vermutet werden, dass mit dem Fortschreiten der Ã¶ffentlichen Debatte zum autonomen Fahren (die ja erst im Laufe der letzten zwei Jahre an Fahrt aufgenommen hat) solche Themen an Relevanz gewinnen werden, die nicht nur die Technologie an sich betreffen, sondern auch ihre Einbettung in das System, also stÃ¤rker den Akzeptanzkontext einbeziehen. Insgesamt spannt die Untersuchung den derzeit gÃ¼ltigen âAkzeptanzraumâ zum Thema autonomes Fahren auf. Dieser Akzeptanzraum ergibt sich aus den Themen, die aktuell die Ã¼ber die Medien gefÃ¼hrte Debatte in der Gesellschaft strukturieren und gleichzeitig mit spezifischen Wertungen verbunden sind. Betrachtet man die Breite an Themen, dann zeigt sich zwar, dass dem autonomen Fahrzeug Ã¼berwiegend positive Eigenschaften zugewiesen, daneben allerdings auch negative Eigenschaften identifiziert werden.

In ï¬ve countries (Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia), subsidies were targeted to either the poor or priority crops and reached a large proportion of farmers. For example, about 65 % of farm households in Malawi beneï¬ted from the subsidy program (Druilhe and Barreiro-HurlÃ© 2012). Likewise, about 95 % of the 2.7 million rural households in Kenya beneï¬ted from the subsidy program that targeted the universally grown maize crop (KNBS 2014). The number of farmers reached in the subsidies that were not targeted is unknown in most countries reported in Table 9.2. However, in cases where the number of farmers reached was known, beneï¬ciaries of the universal subsidies was signiï¬cantly smaller than the case of targeted subsidy programs (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). Investment in input subsidies as share of agricultural budget ranged from 11 % in Burkina Faso to as high as 59 % in Malawi (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). In most cases, government budget covered the entire or largest share of subsidy budget (Druilhe and Barreiro-HurlÃ© 2012) due to the previous donorâs negative perception towards subsidies (Kelly et al. 2011). As shown in Fig. 9.5, the large share of agricultural budget on subsidies has crowded out investment into other essential rural servicesâ such as market infrastructure, extension services, and development of private input markets (Ricker-Gilbert et al. 2013). Jayne and Rashid (2013) also show that the cost of input subsidy is greater than its beneï¬ts and that investment into R&D and rural infrastructure would provide higher returns to agricultural growth and poverty reduction."

The configuration where all gauge fields are zero AA D 0 can be called âthe vacuumâ. However, all configurations connected to AA D 0 by a gauge transformation must also correspond to the same physical vacuum. For example, in an Abelian theory all gauge fields that can be written as the gradient of a scalar, i.e., AA D @ .x/, are equivalent to AA D 0.

However, so long as care is taken not to undertake surveys on rivers with low physical diversity, calculation of preference provides the best way of removing the complicating problem of differing habitat availability between sites. Univariate preference curves can be derived using a number of ratio formula or preference indices. The simplest is a ratio where preference (P) Â¼ use (U)/availability (A). The preference functions can be delimited to take account of time of day, seasonal, life history, and activity factors. When a physical habitat is described by more than one parameter, a combination of several preference curves has to be made. Several combinatory techniques can be chosen here, for example, to use the minimum value of each preference outcome or to use a mean or sum of all parameters or more elaborated statistical methods (see below). Multidimensional statistical analyses for biological modeling Numerous habitat modeling studies have been undertaken over time in North America and Europe, ï¬rst mainly for salmonids (e.g., Northcote 1984; Shirvell 1989; Wollebaek et al. 2008; Moir and Pasternack 2010) but later for non-salmonids also (e.g., Melcher and Schmutz 2010). Predominantly these studies applied univariate habitat use and preference curves. In order to assess anthropogenic alterations on riverine systems, most attention was focused on morphological habitat attributes. It was recognized that functional processes in riverine environments depend on the interactions of many factors, such as ï¬ow velocity and/or riparian vegetation (Melcher and Schmutz 2010). As a result, a more sophisticated analytical toolset is required to quantify the biological consequences of impacted multi-metric environments and to assess ï¬sh habitat improvements in river activities. Multidimensional analyses are needed to better identify and understand habitat requirements (Melcher et al. 2012). Until now parametric methods such as classical variance, regression, or discriminant function analyses (Ahmadi-Nedushan et al. 2006) have been the main statistical methods used for habitat modeling. Due to their speciï¬c statistical presumptions and requirements, their use is frequently limited in comparison to nonparametric methods (e.g., CHAID tree). Logistic regression is a multiple regression model used in habitat modeling in the way that the probability of occurrence is regressed against a number of potential habitat characteristics. It requires ï¬eld observations of habitat characteristics available and utilized by indicator species. Habitat choice is described by the probability of a speciï¬c choice occurring along a habitat gradient. Using the stepwise procedure, all signiï¬cant parameters to describe the habitat are listed (Melcher et al. 2012). The result can be a map that shows the probability of ï¬sh occurrence for each location, each area, or each computational grid cell. The probability of occurrence can be converted to an HSI (habitat suitability index score). Classiï¬cation trees, often referred to as decision trees, predict the value of a discrete dependent variable with a ï¬nite set of values (called classes) from the values of a set of independent variables (called attributes), which may be either continuous or discrete (Breiman et al. 1984; Quinlan 1986).

It is interesting to note that spherical aberration was ï¬rst noted by the Arab scientist, Ibn al-Haytham (d1040) in his magisterial work on optics, âKitab al-Manazerâ (see Chap. 7 2). Whilst this defect was known early on during the electron microscopy development, an effective resolution was only realised and proposed in 1997 (see [15] for a full account). Again, the effect of spherical aberration tends to be more obvious in the TEM case which, when corrected, allows one to resolve structures a small fraction of a nanometre. Its correction in the SEM is also equally important but only applicable in the top of the range instruments. This has in great part been due to the use of ï¬eld electron emitters, which has made it easier to reduce its effect in SEMs. . Figure 6.12 shows the effect of correcting spherical aberration in a modern TEM. Spherical aberration is an effect typically found in imaging instruments, such as cameras and telescopes. Its presence compromises the quality of the resulting image with potential catastrophe, as the scientists in charge of the Hubble telescope found [17]. The HST project cost several billion US dollars and took several years to complete. The ï¬rst images collected were of very poor quality, as shown in . Fig. 6.13a . The fault causing such a poor image was identiï¬ed to be due to spherical aberrations of one of the telescopeâs mirrors and a repair mission was launched to ï¬x it. It consisted of a number of astronauts, one of whom was an experienced experimental scientist who was able to walk in space to repair the fault. . Figure 6.13b shows the effect of correcting the spherical aberration on the quality of the images obtained. The SEM, on the other hand, has also seen a great deal of advancement to improve the quality of the obtained images as well as increasing its resolving power. This has largely been not only due to the use of Schottky and cold-ï¬eld electron emitters as electron sources, both having lower energy spread and much higher brightness than its conventional thermionic counterpart, but also due to a range of efï¬cient electron detectors that have recently been developed. As a result most modern SEMs offer high resolution imaging in the range of 1â2 nm. These ï¬eld emission sources have particularly beneï¬ted the use of low voltage imaging where most modern instruments operate down to few 100 eVs and sometimes even less to obtain an image resolution of the order of few nm.

78,283,0.264,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"environment and, what is more, spontaneous orders evolve through such informational complexity. Although, in his seminal book The Sciences of the Artificial (new ed. 1996), Herbert Simon used to warn that complexity is âtoo general a subject to have much content,â he pinpointed cases where this approach to the complexity of the subject matter can particularly be fruitful: âparticularly classes of complex systems possessing strong properties that provide a fulcrum for theorizing and generalizing can serve as the foci of attentionâ (Simon 1996, p. 181). Here, we can start appreciating how the complexity of ICTs-driven societies affects canonical tenets of legal and political thought, in four different ways. Figure 1 helps me illustrate this informational approach to the complexity of current legal systems. First, the idea of the law as a set of rules enforced through the menace of physical sanctions ( e.g., Kelsen 1949) often falls short in coping with the new legal and political challenges of the information revolution: identity thefts, spamming, phishing, viruses, and cyber attacks have increased over the past decade, regardless of harsh national laws like the US anti-spam act from 2003. Furthermore, a number of issues, such as national security, cyber-terrorism, availability of resources and connectivity, are systemic, that is, they concern the whole infrastructure and environment of todayâs ICTs-driven societies and, thus, these issues have to be tackled at international and transnational levels. Unsurprisingly, national law-making activism is short of breath, and this is why constitutional powers of national governments have been joinedâand even replacedâby the network of competences and institutions summarized by the idea of governance. Leaving aside how this profound transformation affects the sovereignty of national states, much as democratic processes and models of political legitimacy, attention should be drawn to how often the modern stateâs monopoly of power and legitimate violence is over in this context. National sovereign states, although still relevant, should be conceived as one of the agents in âthe formation and stewardship of the formal and informal rules that regulate the public realm,â that is, how Hyden, Court and Mease define the notion of governance (in Grindle 2005, p. 14). Second, the scenario of ICTs-driven societies appears increasingly complex since the quantity of information grows and its theoretical compression decreases (Chaitin 2005). To be fair, this trend is not new: some have summed it up with the very process through which pre-modern communities converted into industrial and ICTs-related societies, up to current post-industrial, or ICTs-driven, societies (di Robilant 1973). Others have traced this complexity back to the emergence of"
284,348,0.264,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction This chapter studies the emergence and spread of community consultations in large-scale metal mining projects in Latin America. These consultations are different from the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)-related consultations, or consulta previa, that are fostered by national governments. From Tambogrande (Peru) in June 2002 to Mataquescuintla (Guatemala) in November 2012, 68 consultations/referenda have been conducted in Peru, Argentina, Guatemala, Colombia and Peru. In all cases the result has been a large opposition to mining projects. This process is occurring in a context of growing pressures to extract mineral ores in Latin America and an increasing number of related socioenvironmental conï¬icts (see Chapter 2). The particularity of these consultations is that these are not commissioned by national governments as part of ofï¬cial procedures to consult communities but instead are promoted by environmental justice movements (EJMs), usually with the support of local governments. The emergence and spread of consultations in Latin America remains poorly studied. Studies addressing mining consultations/referenda have focused on the ï¬rst four cases: Tambogrande, Esquel, Sipakapa and Majaz/RÃ­o Blanco (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Subies et al., 2005; Haarstad and Floysand, 2007; De Echave et al., 2009; McGee, 2009; Walter and Martinez-Alier, 2010; Fulmer, 2011; Urkidi, 2011; Bebbington, 2012a); along with the wave of consultations in Guatemala (Holden and Jacobson, 2008; Rasch, 2012; Trentavizi and Cahuec, 2012)."

349,96,0.263,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"Remote Sensing Data Complete wall-to-wall LULC inventories are generally carried out using a combination of remote sensing data and ï¬eld-based sampling. Remotely sensed data come from aerial photography, satellite sensors, and airborne or satellite-based RADAR or LiDAR. Optical sensors are the most commonly used in LULC classiï¬cation as they provide spectral information in the visible and infrared bands at a range of resolutions and costs (Table 3.2). While ï¬ne (<5 m) or medium (10â60 m) resolution imagery are preferable for accurately monitoring LULC in landscapes dominated by smallholder agriculture, cost of acquisition and/or processing may be prohibitive for projects covering large areas. However, methods exist for nesting high-resolution sampling within coarser resolution wall-to-wall coverage to reduce uncertainty of LULC change analysis across large areas and lower costs (e.g., Achard et al. 2002; Jain et al. 2013). Image processing techniques can be applied to the remotely sensed data to enhance particular land-cover types, or enable more accurate stratiï¬cation and classiï¬cation, such as the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), developing textural variables (e.g., Castillo-Gonzalez 2009) or principle component analysis (PCA). Imagery can also be classiï¬ed into land-cover classes enabling easier manipulation in a GIS. Spatial analysis of remotely sensed data combined with environmental and/or socioeconomic variables can also create additional datasets to further enhance classiï¬cation and stratiï¬cation. Designating ecological or anthropogenic biomes (Ellis and Ramankutty 2008), calculating market accessibility (Chomitz and Gray 1996; Southworth et al. 2004) and identifying landscape mosaics (Messerli et al. 2009) are examples of such user-generated datasets to improve analysis of LULC change and explore drivers of change in smallholder landscapes."
16,444,0.263,"Autonomous Control For a Reliable internet of Services : Methods, Models, Approaches, Techniques, Algorithms, and Tools","OPSR determines how the computing and network resources should be utilized so to execute a DSP application with QoS requirements (e.g., response time, cost, availability). We observe that the application performance depends not only on computing resources, but also on network links that realize the communication among the computing nodes. This is especially true in geo-distributed environment (like Fog computing) and when Big Data have to be efficiently transmitted and processed. The strength of OPSR is the ability to jointly optimize (i.e., in a single stage) the selection of computing nodes and of network paths between each pair of selected computing nodes. We exemplify the problem using Fig. 4. We consider a simple DSP application that filters and forwards important events to a notification service within a limited time interval (i.e., it has QoS requirements on response time). The application comprises a pipeline of three operators: a data source o1 , a filter o2 , and a connector to the external notification service o3 . For the execution, OPSR has to identify computing and network resources from the available infrastructure that, in our example, comprises 4 processing nodes (ri with i â {1, . . . , 4}), 7 network devices (ni with i â {1, . . . , 7}), and 10 network links (li , with i â {1, . . . , 10}â observe that the network is not fully connected). To better show the problem at hand and reduce its complexity, we assume that each computing node ri can host at most one operator and that o1 and o3 have been already placed on r1 and r4 , respectively. Therefore, OPSR has to deploy only the filtering operator o2 selecting between two possible choices: r2 and r3 . Interestingly, the network control layer can expose different views of the network, so that the upper application layer can select the most suitable network characteristics for running its applications. In our example, we consider that the"
137,36,0.263,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"In recognizing and categorizing these responsibilities, it is also important to consider whether they have shifted across time between women and men, and how and why change has occurred or not. While all three responsibilities are, as Tronto (2013) argues, ânestedâ into one another, I will pull them apart for analytical purposes. With regard to emotional responsibilities, ample studies from diverse groups of fathers in a number of countries have found that men can and do take on this responsibility of attentiveness and responsiveness to children (e.g., Biblarz and Stacey 2010; Chesley 2011; Coltrane 1996; Doucet 2006; Doucet and Merla 2007; Goldberg 2012; Kaufman 2013; Marsiglio and Roy 2012; Rehel 2014; Wall 2014). Stay-at-home fathers and fathers on parental leave demonstrate how time at home alone with children is a critical pathway for shifting emotional responsibilities. As revealed in the chapters in this book, it is the hands-on practices of care that can lead to confident and competent caregivers. North American research has pointed to how fathersâ involvement in community responsibilities have also shifted over time, with men becoming more involved and accepted as primary caregivers in schools, community organizations, parenting programs, and the sites where adults and children cluster, and they have increasingly been accepted as the parent to take on responsibilities for connecting home, school, and community activities (Doucet 2006, 2013; see also Kaufman 2013; Marsiglio and Roy 2012; Ranson 2013). In spite of these changes, I would argue that, even in stay-at-home-father families, women still take on much of the organizing, networking, and managing of childrenâs activities and lives (Doucet 2006, 2015; see also Lareau 2011). Part of this slow movement of change in community responsibilities relates, in turn, to how, in many countries, the community landscapes of parenting, especially with infants and pre-school children, are still female-dominated, by mothers and female caregivers. Across the past decade, my research has pointed to continuing challenges for men, where they can feel like misfits in what one father called âestrogen-filled worldsâ (Doucet 2006, 2013). In fact, with few exceptions, most of the stay-athome fathers I have interviewed have narrated at least one uncomfortable experience in community settings with children, especially in parentâinfant playgroups. One Canadian stay-at-home father, Bruno, told me in 2003, âItâs like a high school dance all over again: girls on one side, boys on the other.â Ten years later, Geoff, a laid-off factory worker and now stay-at-home father and part-time school bus driver, said, âI never felt like I belonged thereâ¦ I totally felt out of place. I felt like I was intruding on their sort of little world, and that I wasnât part of it.â In spite of these narrations of discomfort, it is also important to add that the âdad-in-the-playgroupâ narrative has shifted over the past decade. In some North American communities, more and more fathers in urban settings are joining these groups, either as members of female-dominated groups or as participants in fathering groups (Solomon 2014; Doucet 2013). Fathers in community spaces help to shift assumptions, and this is"

353,56,0.262,"Disability, Health and Human Development","Because of the broad set of potential factors influencing wellbeing in the human development model, policy responses to improve wellbeing may have several entry points: health deprivations (preventing health conditions and impairments, improving health in general), resources (enhancing access to goods and services), and structural factors (e.g., change of attitude or physical environment). This comes in contrast to the individual and social models, which is illustrated with the example of policy responses to the disability poverty association. In the disability and poverty discourse, where disability typically refers to impairment and poverty refers to low income or consumption, it is often noted that disability and poverty go hand in hand and their relationship is very often portrayed as a vicious circle, especially in the LMIC context. It has become part of the reasoned wisdom. âIt is a two-way relationshipâdisability adds to the risk of poverty and conditions of poverty increase the risk of disabilityâ (Elwan 1999, p. i). âThe result of the cycle of poverty and disability is that people with disabilities are usually among the poorest of the poorâ (DFID 2000, p. 2). This vicious circle has been proposed and is widely accepted as the explanation for why persons with impairments are more likely to be materially poorer than the rest of the population. In the context of Fig. 2.1, this vicious circle focuses on the reinforcing links between impairments (Box D) and one functioning (low income or consumption) (Box E). The policy prescription is to break the cycle for poverty to be reduced among persons with impairments. Which disability model is adopted to think about these disabilityâpoverty linkages largely predetermines the course of action to break the circle. The medical model predisposes the analyst to identify ways out of the circle through preventive care and the provision of assistive technology, medical care, and rehabilitation services to persons with impairments. The social model is set to point toward changes in the environment as ways out of the circle though the removal of barriers to economic participation in the environment, for instance by changing attitudes toward disability in the community, so that persons with impairments can find jobs. Interactional models such as the ICF or the human development model may point toward a mix of medical and social interventions and go beyond the false dichotomy of having to invest in prevention or inclusion interventions. The human development model can offer further insights. The conversion function explained above is of course very relevant here. It points toward the insufficiency of using income or assets to assess poverty."

319,84,0.262,"X-Ray Contrast Media : Overview, Use and Pharmaceutical Aspects","Interaction with medications To date, only a few interactions of CM for urography, angiography and CT with medications have been described in association with clinical use. Such interactions are extremely improble since these CM bind hardly at all to plasma proteins, cause no inhibition of enzymes, are not themselves subject to metabolism, and are not absorbed enterally. In cancer patients treated with interleukin-2, more side-effects have been observed after administration of ionic and nonionic contrast media. These side-effects include fever, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, and diarrhea [66]. On the other hand, butylscopolamine appears to have no influence on contrast medium tolerance [67]. Due to the risk of lactate acidosis it was originally recommended that treatment with biguanides (Glucophage, Metformin) should be withdrawn two days before administration of intravascular X-ray contrast media to avoid accumulation of the exclusively renally excreted Metformin should the contrast medium induce renal failure [68]. This risk would also be eliminated if biguanide therapy were withdrawn from after contrast medium administration until an effect on kidney function can be ruled out [69]. A variety of pharmaceutical substances were tested for their influence on acute tolerance of CM in animal experiments. Even here, interactions possibly of clinical relevance were rarely observed [70, 71]. In cardioangiography, there is a theoretical concern that the cardiodepressive effect of ionic CM caused by calcium binding will be intensified by calcium blockers (verapamil) [72]."

326,187,0.261,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","of an imperative to avoid collisions that follows from deontological frameworks such as Asimovâs laws coupled with a relative weighing of costs for mobility and traffic laws provides a reasonable starting point. Moving forward, Asimovâs laws raise another point worth considering. The Second Law requiring the robot to obey human commands cannot override the First Law. Thus the need to protect human life outweighs the priority given to human commands. All autonomous vehicles with which the authors are familiar have an emergency stop switch or âbig red buttonâ that returns control to the driver when desired. The existence of such a switch implies that human authority ultimately overrules the autonomous system since the driver can take control at any time. Placing the ultimate authority with the driver clearly conflicts with the priority given to obeying human commands in Asimovâs laws. This raises an interesting question: Is it ethical for an autonomous vehicle to return control to the human driver if the vehicle predicts that a collision with the potential for damage or injury is imminent? The situation is further complicated by the limitations of machine perception. The human and the vehicle will no doubt perceive the situation differently. The vehicle has the advantage of 360 degree sensing and likely a greater ability to perceive objects in the dark. The human has the advantage of being able to harness the power of the brain and experience to perceive and interpret the situation. In the event of a conflict between these two views in a dilemma situation, can the human take control at will? Is a human being â who has perhaps been attending to other tasks in the car besides driving â capable of gaining situational awareness quickly enough to make this decision and then apply the proper throttle, brake or steering commands to guide the car safely? The question of human override is essentially a deontological consideration; the ultimate authority must either lie with the machine or with the human. The choice is not obvious and both approaches, for instance, have been applied to automation and fly-by-wire systems in commercial aircraft. The ultimate answer for automated vehicles probably depends upon whether society comes to view these machines as simply more capable cars or robots with their own sense of agency and responsibility. If we expect the cars to bear the responsibility for their actions and make ethical decisions, we may need to be prepared to cede more control to them. Gaining the trust required to do that will no doubt require a certain transparency to their programmed priorities and a belief that the decisions made in critical situations are reasonable, ethical and acceptable to society."

From these investigations, a systematic set of principles for managing the relationship between man and the environment was developed. In particular, principles of holism, symbiosis, circulation and self-reliance were emphasized (Wong and Bradshaw 2008). In successive phases, appropriate native species were selected, relevant communities from the pioneer to senior phase were built, and each phase of the food cycle was connected, to enable the forest or water system to become a self-maintaining, recycling, living ecosystem. Numerous restoration projects and studies have shown that near-natural restoration could provide ample ecological benefits and enhance environmental quality with minimal human maintenance and a small initial"
100,234,0.258,Migration in The Southern Balkans : From Ottoman Territory To Globalized Nation States,"light of this crisis, andâneedless to repeatâstigmatization by the host societies, the des-identification, that is, the effort to differentiate oneself from the rest of the (stigmatized) group, has been a highly practised option at least among immigrants in Greece. The absence of any physiognomic markers that would render their difference from the dominant society visible, together with their identity management, seems to have suggested the âsocial inconspicuousnessâ of the Albanian immigrants in Greece. Probably every Greek sought to distinguish her or his Albanian neighbours; but, outside this local scale of personal relations and close vicinity, the Albanians were collectively visible in very few cases. For Thessaloniki, the field of my study, the Albanians were distinctively perceptible as a different group only in the piazzas for job-seeking. Compared to their numeric weight in the cityâs population, however, this visibility can be considered negligible. As I have tried to demonstrate in this chapter, the Albaniansâ âsocial inconspicuousnessâ is reflected in the way in which their physical setting is contained within the Greek city. The remarkable absence of ethnic infrastructure and the dispersion of Albanian households throughout the city suggest the âspatial invisibilityâ of the most important immigrant population of Thessaloniki. As maintained in this chapter, despite their great numbers, Albanians do not reveal any visible trace of their ethnicity in the urban space. As such, apart from being socially inconspicuous, Albanians are also spatially âinvisibleâ. It is important to note, however, that both outside forces and the preferences of the migrant group may lead to residential dispersion. This latter is not a sign of weakening of the groupâs identity. Besides, it would be wrong to interpret the counter-practice of clustering as a refusal to integrate, while understanding the residential dispersion as an enthusiastic volition to inclusion. In its way, each option expresses a form of response appropriate to the circumstances created by the migration situation and from the specific resources available to each group of migrants in order to deal with the situation (Barou 2003, p. 263). In this respect, Albanian migrantsâ relative invisibility in Greece, and more particularly in Thessaloniki, reflects a specific adaptation strategy among other optionsâa strategy which is not, anyway, an option for all Albanians in Greece. Moreover, apart from representing the Albanian immigrantsâ adaptation to the conditions encountered in Greece, these strategies respond too to the process of adaptation of Albanians to the post-communist eraâmeaning the realities that emerged after the discovery of the outside world, namely Albaniaâs position in this latter and the questionings that have arisen on what it may mean to be Albanian. These strategies also make use of the cultural legacies of a more distant past. As such, I argue that the practices of inconspicuousness respond to a complex situation that draws on both the Greek context of reception and the Albanian background.

In several countries, initiatives are afoot to build a legal foundation to help broadening the road to a world of openly accessible scientific results. Just to name a few: â¢ In Great Britain, the minister for universities and science, David Willetts, strongly supports a shift to free access to academic research. The British government actually plans to Open Access to all publicly funded research by 2014 (cf. Willetts 2012). â¢ In the United States, an initiative called Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA) is on the way, requiring ââfree online public accessââ.5 â¢ In Germany, the Alliance of German Science Organizations is a strong supporter of an initiative for a change in German Copyright law which is supposed to secure a basic right for authors to publish their findings in accordance to the idea of providing scientists free access to information.6 Since the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI 2002)7 was inaugurated, a number of declarations of different bodies have paved the way. Indeed, the list of signatories of the ââBerlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanitiesââ8 read like a gazetteer of scientific institutions and organizations worldwide. Due to a series of follow-up conferences, the number of supporters of the Berlin Declaration is still growing.

141,133,0.256,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"Description Hierarchy. A multi-level hierarchy that describes a set of related entities at different levels of abstraction is called a multi-level description hierarchy. A description hierarchy can be much simpler than the related structure hierarchy provided the structure hierarchy is highly redundant. If a complex structure is completely un-redundant, then it is its own simplest description [32] (p. 221). We distinguish two types of descriptions, state descriptions and process descriptions. State descriptions describe the state of the world at the instant of observation. Process descriptions explain how a new state of the world unfolds as time progresses that is how the state transitions happen. A description of behavior is a process description. The classiï¬cation of entities in a description hierarchy is usually based on cognitive models of the observer and thus may be dependent on the subjective view of the observer. Moreover, depending on the purpose, different levels of description of the same physical structure can be introduced by the observer. For example, the thermodynamic description of the behavior of a gas is at a higher level of description than the statistical description of the same physical material and the choice among them may depend on the purpose of the description. If the redundancy of a structure is removed from its description hierarchy, then a signiï¬cant simpliï¬cation of the description can be realized (e.g., [32] p. 220). In case the elements of a hierarchy are constructs, i.e. non-material entities that are the product of the human mind, the assignment of the constructs to hierarchical levels always results in a description hierarchy, the organization of which is determined by the purpose of the observer. In many, but not in all cases, the description hierarchy of a structure follows the structure hierarchy. Control Hierarchy. In a control hierarchy the macro-level provides some constraints on the structure or behavior of the parts at the micro-level thus establishing a causal link from the macro level to the micro-level. Constraints restrict the behavior of things beyond the natural laws, which the things must always obey. In many, but not all cases, the control hierarchy follows the structure hierarchy. Ahl [1] (p. 107) provides the following example: The concept army denotes a structure hierarchy that consists of the soldiers of all ranks and contains them all. In contrast, a general at the top of an army (a military hierarchy) controls the soldiers, but does not contain them. In some cases, as the example of the military hierarchy above shows, the control constraints originate from outside, i.e. above the macro-level. In other cases, the control constraints have their origin in the whole, i.e. the collective behavior of the parts of the micro-level. It is this latter case that is relevant for the analysis of emergence. Many equivalent examples can be found in Distributed Computing when we have centralized or decentralized control and management. Since behavior (function plus time) is a concept that depends on the progression of time, there is a temporal dimension in control hierarchies that deal with behavior."
282,16,0.256,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"The Political Declaration of the WSSD in Johannesburg, which was so instrumental in promoting the concept of partnership by including it as an official, âtype IIâ, outcome of the summit, contains no more than the following: We recognize that sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As social partners, we will continue to work for stable partnerships with all major groups, respecting the independent, important roles of each of them. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002a, Â§ 26) The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation that was adopted along with the political declaration is slightly more detailed in that it specifies the involvement of âmajor groupsâ in partnerships. At the same time, it constricts the definition to include only cooperative arrangements focusing on policy implementation (rather than policy definition, for example) in the area of sustainable development. [T]he implementation should involve all relevant actors through partnerships, especially between Governments of the North and South, on the one hand, and between Governments and major groups, on the other, to achieve the widely shared goals of sustainable development. As reflected in the Monterrey Consensus, such partnerships are key to pursuing sustainable development in a globalizing world. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002b, Â§ 3) This definition of partnerships and the subsequent work of the UN are, however, based on a more detailed description of criteria for partnerships. The criteria were developed in the run-up to WSSD and endorsed in the decision of the eleventh meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Like the definition proposed here, they recognise partnerships as voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiatives. But they only focus on initiatives designed to contribute to the implementation of internationally agreed development goals and include a range of normative criteria, such as that partnerships should pursue an integrated approach to sustainable development, display a sectoral and geographical balance and be designed in a transparent and accountable manner.5 The WSSDâs focus on cooperation in order to achieve a public policy goal is echoed in the political science literature, for example, in BÃ¶rzel and Risse, who focus on partnerships that transcend national borders: Transnational PPPs [public-private partnerships] would then be institutionalized cooperative relationships between public actors (both governments"

98,161,0.255,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","For each of the roles played by TSOs, it is possible to infer a set of expected impacts at the individual, organizational, community and societal levels. Some of these impacts are likely to be distinctive (idiosyncratic) to TSOs, whereas other impacts can be common to those of other types of social actors. For example, if there were no TSE organizations with paid employment in social services funded by the governmentâsuch as institutions for elderly careâthere probably would be public and for-profit providers performing those services. This is not to say that the social impacts of for-profit or government organizations providing the same services would be identical to those resulting from third sector provision, as TSOs, because of their distinctive features, innovate services in numerous fields, serve a more needy clientele, deliver services at a more human scale, stay in the game when government funding declines and so on. Hence, it is possible to differentiate the âmainstreamâ contributions of these organizationsâthat is, what TSOs have in common with governmental and for-profit organizationsâfrom their distinctive contributionsâthat is, the functional features that are more characteristic, if not exclusive, to these organizations. Based on reviews of previous research, these functions and roles can be translated into five domains of impact (Simsa et al. 2014; Enjolras 2015a, b): â¢ Well-being and quality of life â¢ Innovation â¢ Civic engagement, empowerment, advocacy and community building â¢ Economic impacts â¢ Human resources impacts In the following section we will present some evidence of TSI based on analyses and reviews of research conducted by this project (on the basis of available data) related to the impact domains outlined above: civic engagement and advocacy; wellbeing and quality of life; human resources; and social innovation. However, as already stated, there are methodological problems related to previous research on impacts, and we address as far as possible these issues in our subsequent analysis."

320,299,0.253,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,Current scholarly publications provide numerous suggestions and recommendations for the adaptation of nature conservation management to climate change (e.g. Glick et al. 2011; Hansen and Hoffmann 2011; West et al. 2009). Most authors discuss general problems of conservation management (e.g. Game et al. 2011; Hannah 2003; Lovejoy and Hanna 2005; Araujo et al. 2011). Only a few address the needs and response options for protected area managers (e.g. Lawler 2009; Welch 2005; Baron et al. 2009) or offer guidelines for adaptation of protected area management (e.g. European Commission 2012; Idle and Bines 2005; Prutsch et al. 2010). Many recommendations for adaptation in nature conservation address the policy level or regional and national scale but are not specific enough to be applied to the tasks and capabilities of protected area management at a local level. Other recommendations aim at the scientific community and do not take practical requirements of protected area management practice into consideration. Of the few recommendations that are focused on protected area management even fewer have been tested in the field. In their review of recommendations for adaptation to climate change Heller and Zavaleta (2009) conclude that the majority of recommendations in the published journal literature lack sufficient specificity to direct immediate action to adapt conservation practice. The general recommendations given are not applicable at the level of protected area management; therefore a practice-oriented approach - as presented below â with detailed guidance for the adaptation process is needed.
142,406,0.253,Subseafloor Biosphere Linked To Hydrothermal Systems : Taiga Concept,"The Central Indian Ridge (CIR) is a slow- to intermediaterate spreading system bounding the Somalia, the India, and Capricorn Plates. The full spreading rate ranges from 23 mm/year at 10 N, to 47 mm/year at 25 S (MORVEL: DeMets et al. 2010) and the ridge axis is characterized by an axial valley. The CIR meets the Southwest Indian Ridge and the Southeast Indian Ridge at its southern end, forming a ridgeâridgeâridge triple junction (Rodriguez Triple Junction: RTJ). In the southern CIR, the ridge axis trends in an almost NNWâSSE direction and is segmented by several transform faults and non-transform offsets (Parson et al. 1993; Briais 1995). Briais (1995) describes the detailed axial bathymetry between the RTJ and 20 300 S, and defines the axial segmentation using a sequential numbering system that increases northward starting at the RTJ. In accordance with this paper, we follow the nomenclature of ridge segments and use the prefix CIR-Sx (Fig. 11.1)."

Historic examples show that early on the state argued that revenues from tolls and other taxation on trading was to provide protection for merchants (cf. Hart 2005: 169).

More tax paid means less (net) income to spend according to an individualâs own wishes and needs, yet it could also imply better and more services. 4. Compare this message with the mottos of other Nordic tax authorities. The Norwegian Skattetetaten has adopted the motto âto secure the welfare stateâs fundingâ and the Danish SKAT takes a slightly more moral stance, stating that taxes âsecure just and efficient financing of our future public sectorâ. If the mottos are mirrors of legitimate taxation values in society, they also cast light on âwhat goesâ in respective society."

She questioned the ânaturalâ when she examined working conditions in different global regions. Boserup led the way in contextualising the division of labour as socially and culturally constructed, although she used different terminology at that time. I will return in the next section to the way she perceived the âstatus of womenâ. In the livelihood approach, we must consider all the work that is required within a community and its household units to organise daily survival strategies. Thus, we need a more holistic view that bears in mind that the activities for peopleâs livelihoods include more than the productive sphere, which is the focus of some narrow economic approaches. Therefore, I believe that Boserup has offered us an inspiring and multidimensional concept."

Generally, we think thatâs exciting and a good thing, but it also means that itâs a challenge for universities and departments when it comes to evaluation and promotion. This is increasingly problematic and becoming more acute. ... My conception of interdisciplinarity is that it is one person whose work is addressed to multiple communities. When that is the case, it may be hard for those communities to feel like the person is fully theirs. Sometimes the closest fields have the most difficulty agreeing on standards of excellence and what is authorship. That can be dangerous for junior faculty. [It] requires that junior faculty must be very proactive, making sure they are communicating with their groups [and] must have a disciplinary home, a core discipline. If you veer too far from home, that can be dangerous. E5: On the one hand, the interdisciplinary trend is, in some parts of the competitive stream, encouraged; thatâs the ERC trend, the European Science Foundation trend (essentially the ERC trend) and also in some parts of national funding. For example, our government in Denmark strongly encourages interdisciplinary research and, in a recent evaluation of the research council system that was published a few years ago, it was one of the major recommendations. So thatâs one trend. You have goals that prioritise interdisciplinary research and on the other hand you have very strong gearing of governing publications that have a very good track record, have a very high gate impact factor, and so forth. And that sort of pushes research towards overspecialisation. E14: Some will promote interdisciplinary research. ... But research is mainly monodisciplinary in our humanities faculty although politics and the rectorat tend to encourage interdisciplinary research. The basic issue is that the institutional incentives may be working in contradictory directions. When it comes to individual hiring and promotion, publishing monodisciplinary books and journals is paramount. But, at the same time, some funding bodies and senior academic administrators are promoting interdisciplinary research. This tension can manifest itself in a number of ways. Career advancement: There is a possible tension between the promotion of interdisciplinary research projects and publication regimes. As we have seen, a scholarâs"

However, 40 % of these networks have less than 20 members, indicating that collaboration is still happening in rather small circles. Furthermore, 68 % of these networks operate at a local level and over a third are in Europe. So these small circles are mostly local, and concentrated on one continent. Still, the positive growth of LCA networks, particularly in emerging economies over the past few years is a success of efforts undertaken, for example, by the UNEP/ SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. It was launched in 2002 and has been key in boosting collaboration around methodologies and tools since then. Similarly, SETAC has provided the LCA community with some space, which has also been used primarily to work on methodological issues. SETACâs main focus, however, remains first and foremost on issues around environmental toxicology and chemistry (SETAC 2015). And while these global players have invaluable strengths and played a great role in advancing life cycle thinking around the world (Quiros 2014), they have so far not focused on working closely with industry and businesses on establishing a global push for consumer information on life cycle aspects. In order to be successful, such a push should also be backed and driven by the entire life cycle community, instead of a number of different stakeholders with different priorities and interests. However, as outlined before, the current state of the life cycle community is characterized by a flurry of small circles, or nodes, at a local level, and a handful of (historical) global players. The community as one clear identifiable and organized stakeholder thus currently does not exist, mostly because it has no home. The lack of such a more organized and structured community that is visible and has its own voice has, however, implications not only from a communications perspective, but also from a collaborative point of view. As outlined above, collaboration happens mostly in small circles. Due to the discussed lack of national, regional or even global coordination efforts, synergies get lost and opportunities for collaboration are missed. While this is mostly an issue for the community itself, the consequences are relevant beyond the community. Communication is absolutely essential to help spread the word, to inform people about the benefits of applying a life cycle perspective and enable companies to put life cycle management into practice by more easily communicating their efforts. As shown over the past two decades, life cycle based thinking and methodologies can help to operationalize sustainability efforts and are applied by companies to identify cost and resource effective sustainability improvements and highlight them to their potential clients (Box 20.1). However, in order to mainstream LCM and thus have a tangible impact on the world, the life cycle community has to get out of the small niche in which it is currently operating. Only then it can become a powerful partner to companies and industry stakeholders and work towards effectively informing consumers on the concept and advantages of taking a life cycle perspective."

Inadequate water puriï¬cation resulting in the discharge of bacteria, viruses, and other organisms into natural waters can be a primary cause of waterborne disease. Although dangerous to human health worldwide, such problems are particularly severe in developing countries. There can be major differences between deep and shallow lakes or reservoirs. Deep lakes, particularly in nontropical regions, usually have poorer water quality in lower layers, due to stratiï¬cation (see Sect. 4.11.3). Shallow lakes do not exhibit this depth differentiation in quality. Their more shallow, shoreline areas have relatively poorer water quality because those sites are where pollutants are discharged and have a greater potential for disturbance of bottom muds, etc. The water quality of a natural lake usually improves as one moves from the shoreline to the deeper central part. In contrast, the deepest end of a reservoir is usually immediately upstream of the dam. Water quality usually improves along the length of a reservoir, from the shallow inflow end to the deeper, âlake-likeâ end near the dam, as shown in Fig. 10.16. Reservoirs, particularly the deeper ones, are also distinguished from lakes by the presence of a longitudinal gradient in physical, chemical, and biological water quality characteristics from the upstream river end to the downstream dam end. Because of this, reservoirs have been characterized as comprising three major zones: an upstream riverine zone, a downstream lake-like zone at the dam end, and a transitional zone separating these two zones (Fig. 10.16). The relative size and volume of the three zones can vary greatly in a given reservoir."

DemgegenÃ¼ber kommt die Gewinnaufteilungsmethode (Profit Split) u. a. dann zur Anwendung, wenn beide Transaktionspartner Ã¼ber wertvolle und einzigartige IWG verfÃ¼gen (OECD-RL Tz. 2.109). Weitere Informationen Ã¼ber den Zusammenhang zwischen der Wahl der Verrechnungspreismethode und dem Funktions- und Risikoprofil der Transaktionspartner finden sich in Kap. 4.5 sowie in Kap. 5. Angesichts der Ã¼berragenden Bedeutung der F&R Analyse fÃ¼r die Verprobung der FremdÃ¼blichkeit von Verrechnungspreisen fordern nahezu alle einschlÃ¤gigen Verrechnungspreisvorschriften eine ausfÃ¼hrliche Dokumentation der Funktionen und Risiken der Transaktionspartner sowie der Verteilung der IWG zwischen ihnen.2 Das vorliegende Kapitel gibt eine kurze EinfÃ¼hrung in die Ã¶konomischen Grundlagen der F&R Analyse (Kap. 4.3) und stellt dann schwerpunktmÃ¤Ãig wesentliche Schritte der Erstellung einer F&R Analyse dar.

The aim was to find fathers who showed some diversity in education and work, particularly to get fathers from both the private and public labour markets. As it turned out there are two fathers with student exam, two craftsmen and six with a university degree. Six of them work in the private sector. All except one had taken 3 or more months of parental leave. All their partners except one, have university degrees and all except two work in the public sector. The interviews were all held in my office at the University of Iceland. The interviews lasted between 40 to 90 min. They were taped and then fully transcribed and analysed, themes identified and compared using the methods described in textbooks on qualitative methods (Kvale and Brinkman 2009; Hennink et al. 2010; Silverman 2013). Naturally, a number of themes came from the questions themselves but other emerged directly from the narratives such as the importance of the will of the mothers and the importance of the care gap."

At CT and MR imaging, lesions tend to be hypodense at unenhanced CT and hypointense on T1-weighted images, with peripheral enhancement at dynamic contrast-enhanced studies [67]. Delayed phase CT/MR imaging (after 5â15 min) may show enhancement homogeneously or in the center of the lesion due to its rich fibrous stroma, which is suggestive of the diagnosis of CCC [68]. Interestingly, the central fibrotic stroma often shows signal suppression on diffusion-weighted MRI and return relatively high ADC value (Fig. 17.17). Periductal infiltrative CCC causes early segmental dilatation of bile ducts in a stage when the tumor itself may be difficult to discern [67]. In addition, there are morphologic features that can suggest the diagnosis of CCC. Peripheral lesions often demonstrate overlying capsular retraction due to their scirrhous, fibrous matrix (Fig. 17.18). Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to an intrahepatic CCC can also provide clues to the diagnosis, as biliary obstruction is usual with intrahepatic metastases (with the exception of colorectal cancer [69]."

In particular, to handle a language with procedures we would use a separate environment to record types for procedures, similarly to what is done in, e.g., [34]. (In loc. cit. they did not cover concurrency; however, we take inspiration from [12] which presents a concurrent separation logic for a language with procedures and mutable stack variables.) Specifications for procedures would involve quantification over variables and security levels."
124,369,0.248,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"Let us begin with this observation: Fact 44. Let âW, Câ be an n-g-manifold on a generalized BST model W = âW, , Oâ and T (W ) be its manifold topology. There is a subset of W that is maximal with respect to having the joint property of being Hausdorff and downward closed. Proof Left for the reader. Recall that a g-history is downward closed (Fact 22) and has the Hausdorff property (Theorem 43); then apply the Zorn lemma. Fact 45. Let H be a g-history in a generalized BST model W = âW, , Oâ and âW, Câ be an n-g-manifold on W. Then H is a maximal subset of W with respect to being Hausdorff and downward closed. Proof The Fact claims that a subspace topology on any subset A â§ W such that H â A is either not Hausdorff or A is not downward closed. To prove it, we pick an arbitrary downward closed A such that A â® H and show that it does not have the Hausdorff property. Since H is maximally consistent, there are y â² â¡ H , y â¡ A \ H such that y, y â² are not consistent. Accordingly, there is a splitting pair âx, x â² â â¡ Y such that x  y and x â²  y â² . Since g-histories are downward closed and A is assumed to be downward closed, x â² â¡ H and x â¡ A, and hence {x, x â² } â§ A. Accordingly, there is a chain C â§ A (because A is downward closed) that has two subsets of upper bounds, with x and x â² being their respective minima. Then every open set U â¡ Tâ§W (A) with x â¡ U contains some nonempty upper segment C â¥z of C, and similarly, every open set U â² â¡ Tâ§W (A) with x â² â¡ U â² contains some nonempty upper segment C â¥z of C. Thus, every intersection of such U and U â² contains some nonempty segment C â¥z , z â¤ = max{z, z â² }, which shows that the subspace topology Tâ§W (A) is not Hausdorff. Note a striking similarity between the above fact and a property of BST1992 histories (see Fact 57). Next, we have a converse result: Fact 46. Let âW, Câ be an n-g-manifold on a generalized BST model W = âW, , Oâ and T (W ) be its manifold topology. Then if A is a maximal subset of W with respect to being Hausdorff and downward closed, then A â¡ g H ist. Proof Let us assume that A is as in the premise and, as a reductio hypothesis, that A is not a g-history. Accordingly, either (i) A is not maximally consistent, i.e., A â H for some g-history H , or (ii) A is not consistent. If (i), since H has a joint property of being Hausdorff and downward closed, A is not maximal with respect to this property, which contradicts the premise. Turning to (ii), there is a splitting pair {x, x â² } below some two elements of A, which is generated by some chain C. Since A is assumed to be downward closed, x, x â² â¡ A and C â§ A. By an argument analogous to that in the last proof, Tâ§W (A) is not Hausdorff, which contradicts the Factâs premise. "

170,110,0.246,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"5 Conclusion The debate on the impact of the information society on the Global South is ongoing and the jury is still out. In this chapter, we attempted to provide context and perspective to this debate. The misgivings of development planners, governments, and donors regarding the outcomes of ICT4D projects were reviewed. The contradictions attendant to evaluating ICT4D impacts were articulated. We discussed The Hague framework, described how it came about, and proposed a way forward, which was to construct theories of change for specific projects or programmes. The chapter presented a generic theory of change that established causal links between attributes of information society and the Millennium Development Goals. It developed indicative ToC maps or pathways to change applicable to eAgriculture, ICT for education, and KM for climate change adaptation. We capped the chapter by describing a possible downside to the use of theories of change. We said that ToCs may guide us in establishing causal links between ICTs and development in the Global South, but we can get blindsided by them. The parameters that we set in our impact evaluations sometimes act as horse blinders, denying us of our peripheral vision and preventing the full appreciation of the information society phenomenon. At a certain point in the evaluation process, we will have to remove these blinders and explore unintended outcomes or impacts."

The cost of inaction on the other hand is the sum of annual losses due to land degradation. In this study, two time horizons are presumed; 6 year periodâa planning horizon typical for small holder farmers in cropland biomes, and 30 year periodâa typical planning horizon for afforestation program in forests, woodlands, and shrub-lands biomes.

To discuss the issues of migrantsâ security, the Libyan context provides a meaningful case of analysis to illuminate the consequences of migration policies in conflict situations. In fact, this country has been one of the first involved in the process of the externalization of EU border control. Further, regulations producing the illegality of migrants and the restriction of mobility have not only worked to relegate migrants to situations of precariousness and marginality in peaceful times. These regulations also impeded migrantsâ safe escapes during conflicts and suspended peopleâs lives for the indeterminate period of being held in refugee camps. As the deaths in the Mediterranean showed, the EU regime of migration control does not foresee the possibility of accessing airports for sub-Saharan workers in Libya (Kumar 2011). Nor does it allow the mobilization of resources, knowledge, and relations outside the rules of humanitarian emergencies.

245,1426,0.245,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"6 Types of Institutional Bases and Analysts As already pointed out, it is difï¬cult to establish a map of institutions and persons involved in higher education research, because the settings are varied and the borderlines are fuzzy. This is all the more true for Europe, because long traditions are lacking and the scene varies substantially by country. As regards the U.S., i.e. the country with a long tradition and an enormous quantity as far as higher education research is concerned, El-Khawas (2000) perceived a clear pattern of three separate sectors: â¢ âResearchâ: Academically-based higher education research is often institutionalised in university units of teaching and research. Most frequently, master and/or doctoral programmes are the educational core activities, and most of them are institutionalised in the U.S. within departments/schools of education; potentials for academic research on higher education, thus, are alimented by these study programmes. Academics put emphasis on theoretical and methodological quality, irrespective whether they favour a pursuit of knowledge for its own sake or whether societal relevance plays a role in their research activities. â¢ âPracticeâ: Many institutions of higher education in the U.S. establish units, often under the supervision of key managers in the individual university, and initiate analyses, which are expected to provide action-oriented interpretation of the ï¬ndings and are considered as important feedback for the enhancement of teaching and learning, research, management, etc."

216,291,0.245,Advances in Production Technology,"14.1 Motives for Integrating Human Factors in Production Engineeringâthe Challenge Production systems are not like they used to be. The 21st century will confront enterprises and manufacturing companies with completely novel generations of technologies, services, and products based on computer technologies (Schuh and Gottschalk 2008; Schuh et al. 2009). In order to meet competition on global markets and to ensure long-term success, the companies need to adapt to shorter delivery times, increasing product variability and high market volatility, by which enterprises are able to sensitively and timely react to continuous and unexpected changes (Wiendahl et al. 2007). One of the major cornerstones to meet these challenges is the implementation of digital information and communication technologies into production systems, processes and technologies, which allow novel developments by combining the physical world and fast data access and data processing via the Internet (Industry 4.0). Another major cornerstone is to understand the impact of the human factor and to integrate human factors knowledge seamlessly in the technology development cycle, thus moving from traditionally purely technical systems into socio-technical systems. In the next decades new generations of technology systems and products have to master fundamental societal and technological challenges (Wilkowska and Ziefle 2011). This includes the impact of the greying society, with an increasingly aged work force, but also short technological life cycles triggered by fast changing technological systems and the question in how far diversely skilled workers might learn and adapt to the increasing complexity of systems (Ziefle and Jakobs 2010). Although the crucial potential of usable products that are appropriate for a diverse user group, recognition of the importance of diversity is only slowly influencing mainstream technology development practise. New approaches integrate users as a valuable source for new ideas and innovations (end-user driven innovation cycle) and integrate their knowledge as an integral component into the technical development (Franke and Piller 2004). User communities are a signiï¬cant source for innovation and provide market insight before launching an innovative product (Fredberg and Piller 2011). For high-wage countries, which are characterized by competitive production systems and a high pressure to succeed, it is more than high time to integrate human factors knowledge as a natural and expert source of information into the technology development and processing. We conclude that these challenges can only be addressed if methods from production engineering are âreinventedâ and combined with methods from the social sciences. Only a holistic inter- and transdisciplinary methodology will be able to address the changing production processes and changing workforce, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of companies in high-wage countries (Calero Valdez et al. 2012)."

The predominant pattern, however, is that the positive identification with their fathersâ masculinity does not exclude identifications with more âfeminineâ values and activities. It is a question to what extent they gender these qualities at all: what it means to be a man may include all sorts of qualities regardsless of whether they have been culturally associated with masculinity or femininity earlier. It resembles what Lynne Layton describes thus: âThe capacity to enjoy being a man without repudiating identifications with women seems to lead to something new, something that is not dominant in the culture and that the term androgyny does not quite captureâ (1998: 189). Masculine gender identity in this generation, especially among middle-class boys, is rather connected to the feeling of being unique and unpredictable than to a specific cultural content."
341,122,0.244,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"As an analytical concept, the âdevelopmental stateâ has been described variously as one that places economic development at the top of government policy priorities and which is able to design effective instruments to promote such a goal (see Mkandawire 2001; UNECA 2013a). Some of the instruments often referred to include the establishment of well-functioning formal institutions, weaving of formal and informal networks of collaboration among citizens and government officials and the utilisation of new opportunities for trade and profitable production (see Fakir 2007; UNECA 2013b). According to Radice (2008), in contrast to the conventionally polar models of liberal free-market capitalism and the state-socialist planned economy, the developmental state is seen as a distinctive political economy that combines elements of market and plan, linking a mixed economy to a politicalâideological approach that combines authoritarian technocracy with a relatively egalitarian distribution of income and wealth. The developmental state has also been characterised as a state that promotes macroeconomic stability, as well as establishing an institutional framework that provides law and order, effective administration of justice and peaceful resolution of conflicts, ensuring property rights and appropriate infrastructure investments and advancing human development (Dadzie 2013; Ayee 2013). It is seen as a state that is determined to influence the direction and pace of economic development by directly intervening in the national development process, rather than relying on the uncoordinated influence of market forces to allocate economic resources (Johnson 1982; Taylor 2002). Elsewhere, the developmental state has been described as one that authoritatively, credibly, legitimately and in a binding manner, is able to formulate and implement its policies and programmes. In other words, it is a state that is capable of deploying the requisite institutional architecture and mobilising society towards realisation of its developmentalist project (Edigheji 2010; UNECA 2013a). UNCTAD (2007) points out that the literature on developmental states has focused their characterisation on two major features, namely, a developmental ideology and a structure pertaining to the requisite institutions, norms and standards that can support the development process. Therefore, their raison dâÃªtre is building"

It was shown by experiments that the accuracy of a Silver Corpus annotation obtained by label fusion of participant algorithms is higher than the accuracy of individual participant annotations. Furthermore, this accuracy can be improved by injecting multi-atlas label fusion estimates of annotations based on the Gold Corpus-annotated dataset. In effect, the Silver Corpus is large and diverse, but not of the same annotation quality as the Gold Corpus. The final Silver Corpus of VISCERAL Anatomy Benchmarks contains 264 volumes of four modalities (CT, CTce, MRT1 and MRT1cefs), containing 4193 organ segmentations and 9516 landmark annotations.

Theodore is âLetter writer 612,â he is praised for his work, later we are also told that he likes books, a sign that he is old-fashioned, a dreamer. Few publishing houses still do print, and in daily life, speech-based operating systems have eliminated the need for writing. In Her the technology is seamless, no hiccups; the devices have beautiful interfaces like books and the larger screens have picture frames around them like art; culture is now technological and online. The computer game that Theodore is playing is a hologram in the middle of the room; he is totally immersed in online communication, and at night he can access cybersex chatrooms just by speaking into the air. Like Disconnect, a major theme in Her is loneliness in a society saturated with opportunities for communication. The ï¬lm is set in a futuristic landscape, and we often see Theodore in his semi-dark apartment with beautiful views over the metropolitan cityscape, very alone. When he travels on the subway, everyone around him wear earplugs, chatting incessantly with their devices, not looking at each other. Although surrounded by marvellous technology, he is not happy, and only comes alive when he falls in love with his operating system. Theodore loves the fact that Samantha is new, fresh and enthusiastic about life, does not have history and baggage, is constantly available and supportive, and has no physical presence. Ironically, the relationship between Theodore and Samantha is the only major relationship in any of the ï¬ve ï¬lms that evolves lovingly and harmoniously, a satirical version of a classic romantic comedy. Theodore and Samantha go on trips, comfort each other, play music together, go on a double date and introduce each other as âgirlfriendâ and âboyfriendâ to friends and family. In these scenes, Theodore is physically alone â with an electronic device in his pocket â but he communicates and behaves as if he has company. In the futuristic world of Her, society has evolved to a point where man-machine relationships are nothing to be shy about, indeed, they are depicted as more rewarding than real-life contact. Almost everybody reacts positively to Theodoreâs romance with Samantha; the only negative reaction comes from Catherine, his estranged wife, who accused him of being âmadly in love with his laptop.â Catherine represents the voice of technological resistance; defending human relationships even if they are complicated and difï¬cult. However, as spectators, we recognize that Samantha is far more than a âlaptopâ; her many talents, complex mind and capacity for unlimited growth make her the perfect company, although she laments the fact that she âdoes not have a body.â"

29,248,0.242,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","But Do the ENIGMA Genes Affect Disease Risk? Shortly after the initial study was published, a second initiative was started to screen the genome for common variants associated with volumes of seven other subcortical structures (the project was called âENIGMA2â; Hibar et al. 2015) and 34 other cortical structures (ENIGMA3; in progress). In the course of these studies, a collaborative partnership began with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) to see if any of the brain-relevant genes were âenrichedâ in the PGCâs own screens for genes associated with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. ENIGMA studies of schizophrenia, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Alzheimerâs disease are currently underway. There is some optimism that these enrichment analyses may show that some of the same genes that affect the structure of the brain also create risk for disease. Several disease risk genes are known to be convincingly associated with brain differences: many of the top 20 or so Alzheimerâs risk genes (according to alzgene.org) are associated with differences in brain structure, metabolism, or pathology identifiable with brain imaging. Some of the logistics involved in looking up ENIGMAâs genes in other psychiatric GWAS involves performing âchecksumâ tests to exclude people who have taken part in both GWAS studies; such participants could cause spurious associations, making it important to screen out non-independent data. In parallel, ENIGMA launched several working groups to identify brain measures that showed the greatest patient vs. control differences in cohorts of patients with schizophrenia (Turner et al. 2014; van Erp et al. 2015), bipolar illness (Hibar et al. 2014), depression (Schmaal et al. 2014, 2015), and ADHD (Hoogman et al. 2014). Some of these studies now number 4000â8000 subjects, making them the largest studies ever of their respective disorders. Clearly, the power to identify correlates of behavioral and cognitive dysfunction, and relevant modulators of illness such as medication effects, makes these efforts highly informative. All these studies are in their earlier phases now, but ultimately they may yield new sources of information to distinguish psychiatric profiles based on brain imaging and genetics and for differential diagnosis and even perhaps prognosis."

For the instrumental variables estimation, we find a positive and significant coefficient for intensity of use, but a negative sign for individual uses. a possible explanation for these results may be related to the types of internet uses considered in the survey. On the one hand, such activities could have an impact on productivity only with a time lag. Since we are not working with time-series data, we cannot consider this. also, the negative signs for some individual activities may be linked to the fact that these uses can generate short-term costs in terms of complementary investments, without immediate benefits. On the other handâas the adoption indicator remains positive and highly significant in all estimationsâthe impact of broadband on productivity may be related to alternative uses, such as, for example, reducing internal communication costs, improving decision-making, developing new internal process or work practices, and firm restructuring. Finally, the positive and significant coefficient of the intensity indicator in the instrumental variable estimation confirms the importance of simultaneously using ICts in various aspects of business activity in order to obtain productivity gains. as expected, the coefficients for physical capital per worker and investment are positive and highly significant, as well as those for skilled human capital. the positive impact of exporter and FdI on productivity verifies the results in Chap. 9 (âInternational Linkages, value-added trade, and Firm productivity in Latin america and the Caribbeanâ).16 results for innovation activity are also similar to those found in Chap. 2 (âInnovation dynamics and productivityâ).17 product innovation shows a positive and significant effect on productivity, while process innovation does not seem to be relevant. a possible explanation for the insignificance of process innovation may be a time lag necessary to translate these improvements into productivity gains. another possibility is that part of the innovation effect is already captured by the broadband variable."

Alternatively, one may create a separate record for each family included in the summary file tabulation. The resulting data set will be much larger. Some might find the less compact form of the data set more familiar for conducting individual level regression analysis. But regression results will be identical either way. The regressions were estimated using OLS regression. This is satisfactory for present purposes and is a convenient choice because it simplifies the presentation and discussion of results. In other situations, it may be necessary to use more technically appropriate regression procedures such as fractional logit regression (Papke and Wooldridge 1996; Wooldridge 2002) to deal with the problem that OLS assumptions are not valid when modeling bounded variables and OLS can yield predictions outside of the 0-1 bounds of segregation indices."

The public administration is also in charge of allocating users to institutions. Under these circumstances, the ability of for-proï¬ts to rapidly expand their service is not interesting for the policy makers. The nonproï¬t ability to cater to niches is also superfluous, as there is no way for users to choose what these niche-oriented providers offer. Competition about public contracts with a focus on costs but with too little emphasis on quality and innovation also gives little room for developing a distinctive proï¬le (TrÃ¦tteberg and Sivesind 2015). In Sweden and Norway, we have even seen examples of nonproï¬t organisations that have stopped operating elderly care institutions because they are not able to promote the goals and values set in their mission statements. If nonproï¬t services do not have room for developing a distinctive character, they cannot ï¬ll gaps in the services offered by the public sector (TrÃ¦tteberg and Sivesind 2015). This underlines the importance of user choice, sufï¬cient capacity, and a minimum of administrative and economic autonomy for distinctive service proï¬les, which are preconditions for synergies between the institutional sectors.

365,472,0.24,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Abstract Adaptation options that work reasonably well across an entire range of potential outcomes are shown to be preferable in a context of deep uncertainty. This is because robust practices that are expected to perform satisfactorily across the full range of possible future conditions, are preferable to those that are the best ones, but just in one specific scenario. Thus, using a Robust Decision Making Approach in Nigerian agriculture may increase resilience to climate change. To illustrate, the expansion of irrigation might be considered as a complementary strategy to conservation techniques and a shift in sowing/planting dates to enhance resilience of agriculture. However, given large capital expenditures, irrigation must consider climate trends and variability. Using historical climate records is insufficient to size capacity and can result in âregretsâ when the investment is undersized/oversized, if the climate turns out to be drier/wetter than expected. Rather utilizing multiple climate outcomes to make decisions will decrease âregrets.â This chapter summarizes the main results from a study titled âToward climate-resilient development in Nigeriaâ funded by the Word Bank (See Cervigni et al. 2013)."

GÃ¼lcanâs brother and his wife stayed on until 2010, but they too recently left for Bulgaria, although the bride wants to come back to Turkey and they are undecided as to where they will settle.

334,395,0.239,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"In reaction to the massive influx of so-called guest workers coming from predominantly Southern European countries, a minority of West Germans complained about the presence of these âforeignersâ1. There were also some isolated acts of aggression. However, this did not result in coherent and organized collective xenophobic activities (Bundesanstalt fÃ¼r Arbeit 1967; KÃ¶rner and Spiess 1982). Despite the guest worker immigration program officially ending in 1973, the number of âforeignersâ living in West Germany has continued to increase until today. In part, this was due to guest workers who not only decided to stay, but also brought their family members to Germany. In later periods, legalized work force mobility within the EU as well as several refugee movements contributed to rising numbers of âforeignersâ in (West) Germany. According to official statistics, in 2014 about one fifth of the population in Germany had a migration background. Among this fifth, two thirds are first generation immigrants and the rest are second and third generation immigrants. Representative surveys undertaken from the 1950s to the present day indicate that the proportion of Germans who hold right-wing or right-radical worldviews and, often connected to this, those that express xenophobic sentiments, has changed little over time. Generally speaking, right-wing attitudes are firmly anchored in parts of the German population (StÃ¶ss 2010; Heitmeyer 2011). Depending on the survey instruments, precise wording and timing, between 15 and 25% of the adult population fall into this category. These people provide the central resource pool and sounding board for decidedly right-wing organizers and agitators and a solid base for xenophobia. In addition, xenophobic ideas also resonate in other strata of the population, including people who place themselves in the middle and even the left section of the political spectrum (Zick and Klein 2014; Decker and BrÃ¤hler 2016; Decker et al. 2016). People holding certain ideas and attitudes do not necessarily turn those beliefs into practice. Rather, beliefs can form a potential for action resulting from previous or ongoing processes of consensus mobilization (Klandermans 2013). Occasionally, this potential is more targeted in attempts of action mobilization. The extent to which people can be activated, or put differently, the extent to which they are willing to take action, depends on many factors, both internal and external to the networks and movements under study. Action mobilization, ranging from: public speeches or symbolic statements, to collective rallies in the streets or to violent attacks, does not occur randomly but rather manifests itself in waves. Quite often, such waves are strengthened or triggered by catalytic processes, e.g. perceptions of crisis, threat, vulnerability, injustice and so forth (Koopmans 2004). It has been argued that the rise of xenophobic activities in Germany was encouraged by the increase of âforeignersâ in certain time periods. One crucial period began in the late 1980s. Apart from the many immigrants with German roots coming from the Soviet"

It seems that Hiroshi did not experience these emotions because of his very exceptional resources. He had a male friend who had already started taking care of a child while he worked at home as a programmer and his wife was working as a full-time surgeon. His parents sometimes visited to see their only grandchild. In addition, he started to use a crÃ¨che (3â4 h for 2 days/week) from the middle of his leave period. He attributed his relatively lower level of stress partly to the fact he had kept cats from the time before the birth of the child. He was able to continue talking to someone other than the baby. This helped him to become accustomed to a living thing with a will of its own, which was sometimes difficult to control, before the birth of his child. It should be also noted that three of other fathers used blogs or social networking services to share their experience with other people and that seems to have compensated for their lack of communication with adults face to face."

Several countries are embarking on structural transformation processes and undergoing tremendous economic, demographic, and social change while trying to minimize the negative effects of climate change. After more than a decade of strong economic growth, declines in commodity prices and economic weaknesses in developed and emerging markets are putting downward pressures on Africaâs economic growth. Major exporters of oil and minerals, which include some of the most populous countries in the continent, are facing severe budget constraints, inherently undermining growth. Whether this economic slowdown is transitory or long lasting remains to be seen. However, this phenomenon will increase the economic challenges faced by many African cities, including high unemployment rates, large housing deficits, and poor urban infrastructure. If African countries are to spur inclusive growth and reduce poverty, the way in which they respond to their demographic and urban challenges will be crucial."

73,45,0.238,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"What role should planners and designers in Australia play to address the loss of food-producing lands? We suggest this problem can be addressed in four distinct ways. First, many peri-urban farms are market gardens developed by migrants in the 1950sâ1960s. The farmers are now elderly and understandably see rezoning their farms for residential development as a retirement income. Respect for this equity issue requires innovative planning for land tenure, related to productive land that allows owners to realise their landâs development value without changing the rural use. This can be achieved through transfer of development rights (TDR) (Armstrong 2005). Parallels exist with built heritage, successfully addressed through TDR which enable owners of heritage buildings to realise similar capital returns to those who own non-heritage buildings by transferring their development rights to other locations. Western Sydneyâs designated Growth Centres are ideally placed for such transfer of development rights to save productive peri-urban land. The second issue relates to reversing âRural Residentialâ zoning. Many local government areas are pressured by the electorate to rezone agricultural land to âRural Residentialâ. This is the least supportable way to use such valuable productive land as it merely satisï¬es the desires of afï¬uent exurbanites seeking so-called âlifestyle livingâ in the rural areas outside cities. Conversion of prime farming land in the Sydney region into rural residential lots has been at the forefront of political and development conï¬ict about appropriate planning for peri-urban lands (Sinclair et al. 2003). European designer/planners offer alternative models for âRural Livingâ that allow for continued productive farming associated with new clustered residential areas. This involves innovative land tenure and inventive forms of governance drawn from the organizational strategies associated with cooperatives. There are interesting examples in the Netherlands, Hamburg and Zurich, such as the"

364,172,0.237,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract This article discusses community-based mangrove forest management and its implications for environmental risk management. The article draws on the case study of Pred Nai village in Trat province, near the Cambodian border in southeast Thailand. The village of Pred Nai has successfully re-forested 1,920 ha of mangrove forests that were previously converted into shrimp aquaculture ponds in the mid1980s. The village has set up a community forest committee and a community resource use regulation and management plan in order to regulate, control, and manage the use of resources by community members. In the process of community mangrove forest management, local villagers have been encouraged to participate in every single step of forest management and planning. It is the active involvement of the local people together with the support of the relevant authorities and national institutions that makes the Pred Nai example a success. The article concludes by pointing out the key lessons learned from community-based mangrove forest initiatives in Pred Nai that can be applied in natural disaster risk management processes.

The receiving channels through which the signals pass contain amplifiers and filters, the overall amplitude (voltage) responses of which are Hm .!/ and Hn .!/ for antennas m and n. Here, ! represents a frequency at the correlator input; the corresponding frequency at the antenna is !LO Ë !. The voltage waveforms that are processed by the receiving system result from cosmic noise and system noise; we consider the usual case in which these processes are approximately constant across the receiver passband. The spectra at the correlator inputs are thus determined mainly by the response of the receiving system.

Indeed, the potential for cinema to become a vehicle for ideas about art and imagery, and about the world itself, has been acknowledged since at least as far back as the uber-film theorist AndrÃ© Bazin of the 1940s whose ontological approach to the image was part of an even older quest to âsecure the autonomy of film as both medium and artâ that extends back almost as far as the birth of cinema itself.10 So, what is a video essay and how does it work as example of Practice as Research in terms of approach, genre and output that might be regarded as a viable alternative to the academic book? A substantial video essay, through both its content and its formal qualities, should of course provide new insights, whether into specific films or sets or films and/or into the aesthetic, socio-economic, political and/or cultural contexts within which those exist. The best of these might also break new ground in demonstrating how the emerging form of the video essay, often articulated as experimental documentary, without voice-over or subtitling, might help us to view the world from a fresh perspective. They should also, as Erlend Lavik argues, demonstrate âthe ability to not just engage with complex thought, but to pull it into focus, and to articulate and communicate those ideas clearlyâ.11 Above all, the video essay should serve as âa springboard to launch into a vital investigation of knowledge, art and culture in the 21st century, including the question of what role cinema itself might play in this critical project: articulating discontent with its own place in the worldâ.12 The video essay format, which can vary considerably in length, has experienced a noticeable renaissance thanks to the work of respected theorist-practitioner-activists such as Catherine Grant and Michael Chanan, amongst others, who not only develop and distribute â mainly through peer-reviewed Open Access platforms â their own new insights through video-essay collections, but also champion the work of others in the field.13 Indeed, for Grant,14 the potential of the video essay is that it âcan inspire compelling work not DOI: 10.1057/9781137595775.0008"
144,496,0.236,25 Years of Transformations of Higher Education Systems in Post-Soviet Countries : Reform and Continuity,"Using Teichlerâs (1988) framework of horizontal and vertical system differentiation and organizational interrelationships, the most prominent bifurcation in Tajikistan was the âuniversityâ versus the âinstitute.â However, the university was not exactly commensurate with those of the West, as it was more tightly controlled by the government and primarily focused upon teaching at the expense of independent research. Tajik State University, however, did have better funding and more freedom and enjoyed much greater prestige than did the institutes. The other primary axis of differentiation occurs at the level of region. Initially, the higher education system started as âdual-centeredââwith HEIs operating in Dushanbe and Khujand; but the educational dominance of the capital eventually gained momentum. Meanwhile, the fact that a pedagogical institute in Khujand is one of the first Soviet era institutes greatly impacted the regional landscape. Throughout Soviet history and today, âin its scientific and pedagogical potential and the number of students, it is considered second only to the Tajik (National) Universityâ (websites, KhSU). Sectoral expansion of the system was specifically tied to the needs of the socialist economy. There was one institute per sector in agrarian, medical and polytechnic fields (except, as we have seen, for the last year before independence). The rest of the system was overwhelmingly pedagogical: Not only were there four pedagogical institutes and one branch of Dushanbe in Kurghon-Teppa, but the graduates of the Physical Culture Institute and (most) graduates of the State University were assigned to work as secondary school teachers. And as a Soviet state, no private HEIs were allowed. Table 14.1 represents the classification of HEIs by the time of independence (1989/1990). In sum, the Tajikistan higher education system during Soviet period was maintained as a response to the direct need of the planned economy with well-developed technical, engineering, medical and pedagogical education. However, the high centralization of the Soviet educational system was not responsive to changes in the labor market. A number of other characteristics contributed to the weaknesses of higher education such as restrictions on faculties and student enrollments in fields like history, linguistics, genetics and sociology; poor management of financial and human resources; and narrow and rigid vocational and professional curricula (Johnson 2008; Anderson et al. 2004). This would all change with independence."
45,606,0.235,Measurement and Control of Charged Particle Beams,"With such noise sources present, the evolution of the distribution function f (I, t) is no longer described by (11.1), but by a FokkerâPlanck equation of the form  6 1 â2 âf (I, t) (ÎI)2 f (I, t) + f (I, t) , (11.12) 2 âI 2 where now the angular brackets denote an average over the entire beam distribution, including the action variables, and over the noise. For example, if the FokkerâPlanck terms ÎI and (ÎI)2  are linear in I and constant, respectively, the equation reduces to D âf Î»If + (11.13) 2 âI where Î» = ÎI/Ît/I, and D â¡ (ÎI)2 /Ît. The beam then asymptotically approaches the distribution, fâ â exp(âI/Iâ ), with the equilibrium emittance (for the equality of rms emittance and average action see (1.14) and Ex. 1.1) Ç« = It=â = Iâ = (11.14) Using (11.13), this distribution is easily shown to be stationary: âfâ /ât = 0. The cooling of various particles can be coupled, e.g., in stochastic cooling the time resolution may be limited by the amplifier bandwidth, and on each passage through the cooler only the average position of several particles is measured and damped. Under these circumstances, the beam is fully cooled only if the individual particles exchange their positions within the beam, so that on successive turns the measured average position, which is damped, refers to different combinations of particles. This process of particle exchange is called âmixingâ."
118,577,0.235,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"A simple solution to this dilemma, whether energy policy decisions should be taken by scientific experts alone or by policy makers who often come with little scientific background, does not exist. Engineers should limit their work to convey all possible data in an honest way, with the expectation that other engineers will do the same in their respective fields and that the public or policy makers will listen to expertsâ analysis. However, these expectations are often unfulfilled. The creation of mixed figures such as policy makers with technological backgrounds could be a possible improvement. However, a division of roles in the decision making process between policy makers and engineers must be preserved to clearly identify who should have an unbiased scientific opinion and who should consider socio-political aspects during decision making."

335,368,0.235,"Open Source Systems : Towards Robust Practices 13Th Ifip Wg 2.13 international Conference, Oss 2017, Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 22-23, 2017, Proceedings","For open source software to be widely accepted and used, itâs essential to simplify the evaluation and adoption process and to increase the comfort level of decision makers in choosing and using open source software. Achieving this goal led to the concept of the Business Readiness Rating (BRR) in 2005 [1]. People often rely on reviews from trusted sources, e.g., Consumer Reports in the US, or collected opinions with summary scores, for technical and consumer products, restaurants, ï¬lms, and automobiles. Some of these ratings are multidimensional, while others are a single combined score reï¬ecting all facets of the reviewed product. The Business Readiness Rating followed this well-established tradition, giving reviewers a framework to evaluate various characteristics of an open source project as they apply to that reviewerâs speciï¬c requirements. Goldenâs Open Source Maturity Model (OSMM) [2] used a matrix of weights and values to calculate a maturity level for open source software. The OSMM, along with QSOS [3], and unpublished work by the consulting ï¬rm CapGemini, were all inï¬uences on the BRR approach. Subsequently, the OpenBQR project [4], within the Qualipso Project, drew upon all of these to create a new quality evaluation framework, but that eï¬ort does not appear to have progressed beyond the initial work reported in 2007. 2.1 Evaluation Categories From discussions with evaluators, we identiï¬ed categories that are important for the open source evaluation process. We used those categories, along with those found in"
271,613,0.235,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"which operate by the same mediated, fluctuating logic. This nesting is evident in the chapters in the second part, which deal with institutions and organizations such as journalism, blogging, schools and the Church. The nested view is most effective, however, when applied to more fluid domains. The interweaving of different figurations helps us understand bottom-up social action, such as the repair cafÃ©s discussed by KannengieÃer (Chap. 5) or the hacker collectives discussed by Kubitschko (Chap. 4). Furthermore, the analysis of everyday mediated and unmediated interactions, such as the social life in cities as analyzed by Hepp et al. (Chap. 3), is much enlightened by this layered approach. Finally, this interweaving sheds light on the interconnectedness of global and local, as shown by Robel and Marszolek (Chap. 7). This nested nature of figurations can also be extended downwards, to everyday interactions or even to individual or intra-individual level: the formation of self and identity, the expression of emotions, the regulation of bodies. The theoretical agenda certainly allows for this. However, the focus seems to be more on the upwards connection, from microtowards meso- and macro-levels, rather than across micro-levels. Every now and then, the chapters offer tantalizing glimpses of an extension towards the shaping of selves and the role of emotions in these figurations. For instance, Wolf and Wudarski discuss the emergence of new, informal ways of learning, and new forms of expertise in online gaming (Chap. 6). Friemel and Bixler show how adolescents bond while communicating through media, about media (Chap. 8). Pritzlaff-Scheele and Nullmeier show that people (sadly) have more trouble reaching decisions in online settings (Chap. 12). In these cases, the figurations expand upwards, towards wider societal networks, but also downwards, towards the shaping of emotions and identities. Throughout the volume, authors show how people and media come together in figurations through practice. The practice-based approach captures peopleâs simultaneous engagement with various media and other people, highlighting not only the interweaving, but also the coconstitution3 of figurations through people and media. The focus on practice means that media and people are seen simultaneously, without one having analytical or causal precedence over the other. In some chapters, the analytical focus on practice is combined with the nesting of figurations on different levelsâespecially Hepp et al. (Chap. 3); Kubitschko (Chap. 4), Kramp and Loosen (Chap. 9); Breiter and Ruhe (Chap. 13); Friemel and Bixler (Chap. 8). In these cases, the new figurational"

The fundamental value of a political itemâits political substanceâmay be established by its capacity to represent a societal problem. By being placed on the agenda, light may be shed upon it; it may be deliberated and acted upon. Trivially there are ideologically founded differences among various political parties pertaining to what should be considered societal problems and their order of priority. In Denmark, for instance, equality is seen as more of a problem by the left wing than by the right wing, and the opposite goes for high taxes. However, there is still quite a consensus that political issues such as unemployment, immigration, crime, and domestic violence are indeed social problems that need solving. These problems will not get solved politically, if the political debate loses its substance. If too much attention is spent on symbolic messages, signal policies, and debating for the sake of debacle without any potential of reaching concrete results, other than perhaps a further polarization of the political fronts. Swaths of the scarce attention in such cases go to political items with no actual content. What is being debated and sucks all oxygen out of the public space in a political bubble is not, for instance, how best to solve integration problems or address the current refugee and immigration crisis. Rather, it is the sending of a signal to the public germane of who the sender is and where that per-"
241,458,0.234,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"in the summers of 1997, 2002, 2003 (Feistel et al. 2006) and 2006 were of a two-layer (baroclinic) type that transported high-saline, but warm and low-oxygen water to the deep layers of the Baltic Sea. Thus, warm water inflows, whether baroclinic or barotropic, transport less oxygen to the Baltic Sea than cold water inflows, and higher temperatures increase the rate of oxygen consumption (through organic matter mineralisation) in the deep water and increase production of hydrogen sulphide (MatthÃ¤us 2006). Inflow activity is very clear in the daily temperature records for the deep layers in the Gotland Deep (Fig. 7.5). The low temperatures apparent during 2003 reflect the normal barotropic inflow in winter 2002/2003, described in many papers (e.g. MatthÃ¤us et al. 2008; LeppÃ¤ranta and Myrberg 2009). Changing stratiï¬cation strength also has a feedback to mixing processes. For example, OsiÅski et al. (2010) found that the major inflow in winter 2002/2003 increased the value of the ï¬rst baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation (which determines the size of mesoscale eddies) in the southern Baltic Sea from about 4 km (in the pre-inflow period) to more than 9 km. At the sub-regional scale, many aspects of the change in salinity and stratiï¬cation are important in the context of ecological status and environmental and climatic impacts. When saline waters enter the Baltic Sea, the halocline is lifted up and this signal is dynamically transferred to the downstream basins (Meier 2007). Upstream from the Gotland Deep, in the south-western Baltic Sea, the variations in deep-water properties are generally of higher amplitude; downstream along pathways of deep-water advection they are damped due to a wide range of mixing processes (e.g. Reissmann et al. 2009). In the Bornholm Basin, deep temperature observations reveal waters of warm and cold inflows (Mohrholz et al. 2006) that can be later traced in the"

The A-Star model, which hit the global markets in 2009, had a production volume set at 140,000 vehicles, of which 100,000 were exported to Europe that same year. Exports to Europe have been stagnant due to the slumping European economy, but Suzuki is preparing toward a transition development of compact vehicles to India. As part of that process, in 2013, it is planning on opening a development center with a test course in Rohtak, a city in the state of Haryana. Modifications such as the increased engine room to the 660 cc Japanese light vehicle Alto to place a one liter engine, and body modifications to the ECCO passenger car based on Japanâs commercial vehicle Every, have been carried out locally. Testing these completed vehicles was previously conducted in Japan, but it can now be conducted in India with the opening of a testing center, thereby considerably shortening the development phase for products going to both Indian and other foreign markets. Maruti Suzuki is also proactive in its CRS activities, and has opened Maruti Driving Schools (MDS). As of March 2009, more than 50 of these schools were in place, compared to 34 in the previous year. This number grew to 163 by November 2011. Aiming to reduce traffic accidents, Suzuki considers education on safe driving as part of its responsibility as the nationâs top automaker."

He has taken more of the parental leave than the fatherâs quota (and because of that caused a few raised eyebrows at his work place), and had wanted even more. But Pia insisted on taking eight months so that she could nurse the children at least for the six months recommended by the health authorities. This has been the only disagreement between them. She thinks that the feminist agenda sometimes is too inflexible: âI donât know if I think itâs a great step forwards for the Womenâs Movement that mothers carry breast pumps in their lunch breaks â¦ thereâs a lot of closeted nursing at night.â But it was great to have a stay-at-home husband when she went back to work, because she felt it was so safe. Pia, who had quite a negative relationship with her father, seems to have identified consciously with her motherâs skills and career, but also unconsciously with her submissiveness to dominant men. The positive part of the identification made her quite consciously go for another type of man and she is aware that this choice is what has made it possible for her to pursue the gender-equality values she has been a firm supporter of since she was 18. âI have won the biggest prize in my husbandâ, she says with a happy smile. But had he been âa climberâ, she is sure that she would have lost the battleâthat is a lesson she takes from friends whose husbands are in high-powered jobs in the private sector. Hildeâs experiences confirm this. Her husband has a career in the private sector, whereas she holds a PhD and works in the public sector. She was also one of the radical girls at 18 with regard to gender equality. Like Tonje and Pia, she criticised her parentsâ work division, in spite of it being actually quite equal. At 30 she postponed having children, as she was aware of the âgender trapâ, not least since her husband comes from a culture that is quite distant from Nordic ideas of gender equality. At 40 they have two children and she describes a sort of backlash in her own generation, not so much because of her husbandâs cultural roots, but because of his job. She now acknowledges that her parents shared much more equally than she and her husband are able to. He is exhausted when he comes home after long workdays, and even though she understands this, she insisted that he hired a cleaner to do his share. They share a good deal of the childcare, her husband does the shopping and she does most of the cooking and all of the laundry.

Once treated, water can be stored and distributed within the urban area, usually through a network of storage tanks and pipes. Pipe flows in urban distribution systems should be under pressure to prevent contamination from groundwater leakage and to meet ï¬re protection and other user requirements. After use, the âwastewaterâ is collected in a network of sewers, or in some cases ditches, leading to a wastewater treatment plant or discharge site. Wastewater treatment plants remove some of the impurities in the wastewater before discharging it into receiving water bodies or on land surfaces. Water bodies receiving effluents from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants may also receive runoff from the surrounding watershed area during storm events. The discharge of point and nonpoint pollutants into receiving water bodies can impact the quality of the water in those receiving water bodies. The fate and transport of these pollutants in water bodies can be predicted using water quality models similar to those discussed in Chap. 10. This chapter briefly describes these urban water system components and reviews some of the general assumptions incorporated into optimization and simulation models used to plan and manage urban water infrastructure systems. The focus of urban water systems modeling is mainly on the prediction and management of quantity and quality of flows and pressure heads in water distribution networks, wastewater flows in gravity sewer networks, and on the design efï¬ciencies of water and wastewater treatment plants. Other models can be used for the real-time operation of various components of urban systems."
214,207,0.233,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"One major challenge in ocean modeling is a dearth of observations, particularly below the surface. The ocean is more difï¬cult to observe than the atmosphere because it rapidly absorbs most wavelengths of radiation, and it is sparsely populated (by humans at least). So there are a lot less data beyond just the surface of the ocean. Most deep ocean data still have to be taken directly, which is not easy in a 4,000-m deep ocean. The rise of autonomous devices (buoys and small, unmanned undersea vehicles) enables remote measurements where unmanned submersible devices can rise and sink down to at least 2,000 m, recording temperature, salinity, and current measurements not unlike weather balloons in the atmosphere. Some have large ï¬xed buoys at the top, and some drift, relaying their information to satellites when they surface. These systems are rapidly improving ocean observations and contributing to evaluation of ocean models, but observations of the deep ocean (below 2,000 m depth) are still very limited. Another challenge in ocean modeling is properly representing the effect of small-scale eddies that cannot be explicitly simulated by a large-scale ocean model. Eddies move a lot of mass in the flow in the ocean, more like a meandering stream than a straight channel. This can be seen in the picture of small eddies in the Atlantic Gulf Stream in Fig. 6.4. Because the scale of eddies (6â30 miles, 10â 50 km) starts approaching the ocean-model grid scale, it is difï¬cult to represent them properly. Trying to represent a curvy flow in a stream is difï¬cult if there are only one or two values for the current. One solution is âhigh-resolutionâ (6-mile or 10-km spacing) ocean models that âpermitâ the formation of eddies but are too coarse to resolve them properly. Furthermore, ocean models have long adjustment timescales because of the deep ocean circulation. The use of simpliï¬ed models of the mixed layer has come about since a full dynamic ocean model with a thermocline and a deep ocean circulation will reach a steady state (no change to climate with no external forcing) in about the time it takes for the ocean water to recycle, which is thousands of years of simulation. However, a mixed-layer model can reach equilibrium in only decades. The implication of this long timescale means that perturbations to the earth system will take thousands of years to equilibrate because of the slow processes in the ocean."

This trend is particularly strong in landslides in Cenozoic rock. On the other hand, one of the factors causing Mesozoic and Paleozoic rock to sliding down relatively easily is that these landslides have a relatively symmetric shape. Further analysis incorporating additional examples is required; there is a possibility that the characteristics of large-scale landslides deduced herein are also common in areas outside of Japan that have similar geology, topography, and evolution of geological structure.

As populations and economies grow, more wastewater pollutants are generated. Many of these are discharged into surface and ground water bodies. Increasingly the major efforts and costs involved in water management are aimed at water quality protection and management. Conflicts among various users of water are increasingly over issues involving water quality. Natural water bodies are able to serve many uses. One of them is the transport and assimilation of many waterborne wastes. As natural water bodies transport and assimilate wastes, their quality changes. If the quality of water drops to the extent that other uses are adversely impacted, the assimilative capacities of those water bodies have been exceeded with respect to those impacted uses. Water management measures are actions taken to ensure that the total pollutant loads discharged into receiving water bodies do not exceed the waste assimilative capacity of those water bodies and that the quality meets the quality standards set for those waters. What uses depend on water quality? Almost all one can identify. As everyone knows, all living organisms require water of sufï¬cient quantity and quality to survive. Different aquatic species can tolerate different levels of pollutant concentrations that impact water quality. In much of the developed world it is no longer ââsafeââ to drink natural surface or ground waters. Treatment is usually required before these waters are safe for humans to drink.

In this paper, we present a transcompiling pipeline that automatically tackles both problems: it can be used to port a policy into an equivalent one, when the target firewall language is different from the source one; when the two languages coincide, transcompiling supports policy maintenance and refactoring. Our transcompiler and its correctness are based on a formal intermediate firewall language that we endow with a formal semantics."

84,218,0.232,Eye Tracking Methodology,"9.1 Integration Issues and Requirements The salient characteristic of the table-mounted eye tracker is its calculation and delivery of instantaneous (x, y) coordinates of the the userâs gaze. Computing applications receiving this signal can then be developed to make use of this real-time information in a number of different ways (see Chaps. 21â24). The most basic application is diagnostic in nature where the application collects gaze coordinates while the user is watching some form of stimulus (e.g., images, video, Web pages, desktop). Following eye movement (signal) analysis, one can infer the userâs attentional strategies and in turn the stimuliâs attentional qualities. Diagnostic applications are thus off-line because the display generally does not change contingent on the userâs gaze location. In contrast, interactive applications can make use of the viewerâs real-time gaze location by either changing their appearance in some way or by directly invoking the userâs gaze to affect control of the application. The former type of passive interface is termed gaze-contingent and is often used to evaluate characteristics of the human visual system. For example, one can provide imagery degraded in the userâs peripheral visual field. If the user reports no perceived effect, then such a gaze-contingent display has successfully matched the human visual systemâs resolving capacity. The latter type of active interface allows the user to control aspects of the interface directly through eye movements. The classic example is using the (x, y) gaze coordinates in place of a manual mouse."

These interactions are classified into four types: verbal communication, mental simulation, complementing, and verification. Verbal communication is a process to transfer some cognitive entity from one person to another by explicit utterance. Mental simulation is a process to derive new cognitive entities from some others within the same MBM layer by inference using knowledge and manipulating mental models. Mental simulation is a process for interpretation and prediction not only of the state of external world but also of the partnerâs behavior. In complementing, some cognitive entity will be copied from one MBM layer to another within the same person. One adopts this scheme, for instance, in an occasion where he/she supposes his/her partner believes X because he/she believes X. Such a supposition, however, sometimes results in false presumption. Finally, verification is the comparison of cognitive entities between different MBM layers to check consistency among mutual beliefs. The cognitive processes mentioned above are nonlinear effects in terms of a combination of individual cognitive processes, and MBM becomes much more complex for a team larger than a dyad. Team cooperation by humans is more than simple division of labor. Accidents often occur with highly automated systems with no hardware failures, because mutual beliefs and cooperating interactions are lacking in systems where a linear human-machine combination is assumed. Consideration of the nonlinear nature of team performance is necessary also for sophisticated human-machine cooperation."

She argued that diagrammatic reasoning is based on abductive, inductive, and deductive reasoning, leading to a deeper understanding of the objects that signs represent. Then mathematical diagrams appear as epistemological tools that, through systematic observation, can lead the students to better understand the structure and interrelation of mathematical concepts in mathematics problem solving and proving. Kadunz focused on the nature of mathematical objects. To make his ideas explicit, he organized his considerations on the relation between mathematics in school and at university, and on means of translation between these two realms. He argued that a successful translation does not need the assumption of an objectively existing mathematical instance. Day 2. Again there were three plenary presentations: â¢ Wolff-Michael Roth: Birth of signs: From triangular semiotics to communicative ï¬elds. â¢ Candia Morgan: Use of social semiotics to explore institutional assumptions. â¢ Michael Otte: Semiotics, epistemology, and mathematical generalization. Rothâs paper followed a line of theoretical development of the late Vygotsky, who, near the end of his life, envisioned a radical revision of his work on sign operations. Roth showed that a focus on the developing communicative (semiotic) ï¬eld that is common to participants gives rise to a fruitful rethinking of traditional approaches to the sign and sign operations. Morganâs presentation revolved around the general principles and use of social semiotics in mathematics education. Through social semiotic lexical analyses of ofï¬cial documents she pointed out some textual patterns that make visible some assumptions about mathematics, teachers, and students. These patterns conï¬gure the kinds of agency that are made available for teachers and students (e.g., students are portrayed as âhaving needs,â and as entities in âneed of receiving appropriate supportâ). Otteâs presentation started with an overview of the difï¬culties that semiotics faced before coming to be seriously considered in mathematics education research in the"

118,607,0.23,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Abstract While the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident shook the community of nuclear engineers, it had a special significance for nuclear engineering students. What were they supposed do? How should they and could they answer questions about nuclear safety? What about their future opportunities? The incident caused many students to question their deepest convictions about all things nuclear and opened up new questions about their social responsibilities. This chapter looks to the history of nuclear engineering education to provide context for the discussions that took place during the summer school. Historically, students have seldom had opportunities to engage the socio-ethical dimensions of their work. The summer school offers evidence that todayâs students are actively seeking new analytical skills and different ways to conceptualize the socio-ethical complexity of nuclear engineering problems. Moreover, students are poised to play a key role in shaping much needed curricular reforms. Keywords Education Â· Ethics Â· Collaboration Â· History Â· Interdisciplinary Â· Students Â· Societal role"
372,1208,0.23,Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy : Third Edition (Edition 3),"10.2.6 Wide-Field Imaging To take full advantage of large new instruments with wide bandwidths, high sensitivity, and full polarization responses, it is necessary to measure the radio sky down to the level of the background radiation from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and to be able to separate out components from individual radio sources that overlie the background. The width of the synthesized field may be much greater than a few degrees, so the image is no longer the Fourier transform of the visibility function. The basic requirement for such an analysis is an equation for the visibility values that would be measured for a given brightness distribution, taking account of all details of the locations and characteristics of the individual antennas, the path of the incoming radiation through the Earthâs atmosphere including the ionosphere, the atmospheric transmission, etc. This is the interferometer measurement equation introduced in Sect. 4.8. In its basic form, it describes the response of a single pair of antennas and is thus applicable to any specified system of antennas and any brightness distribution, to provide values of the visibility for each antenna pair. It includes direction-dependent effects such as the primary beam patterns of the antennas, polarization effects that vary with the alignment of the polarization of the source relative to that of the antennas, and the baselines of the antenna pairs. These must be accounted for without small-field or other approximations. Direction-independent effects such as large-scale propagation in the atmosphere and the ionosphere, and the response of the receiving system, can also be included. The reverse operation, i.e., the calculation of the optimum estimate of the image from the measured visibility values, is less simple. Taking the Fourier transform of the observed visibility function usually produces a brightness function with physically distorted features such as negative brightness values in some places. However, starting with a simple but physically realistic model for the brightness, the measurement equation can accurately provide the corresponding visibility values that would be observed. By comparing these with the observed values, it is possible to adjust the brightness model toward the observed distribution and, by iterative repetition of this process, to arrive at an image that agrees with the visibility"

256,340,0.23,"Supercomputing Frontiers : 4Th Asian Conference, Scfa 2018, Singapore, March 26-29, 2018, Proceedings","Gathering and analyzing job logs in HPC systems is a widely studied topic in computer science literature. In recent years, there have been many studies on analyzing job logs focusing on anomaly detection, failure prediction, runtime prediction, and so on. Klinkenberg et al. [2] proposed and evaluated a method for predicting failures with framed cluster monitoring data and extracted features describing the characteristic of the signals. Authors in [3] presented a machine learning based Random forests (RF) classification model for predicting unsuccessful job executions. In modern supercomputing centers, successful or health jobs occupy a very large part of job databases. However, authors used the overall accuracy as an evaluation metric in those works, which cannot truly reflect unsuccessful execution results. Tuncer et al. [4] presented a method to detect anomalies and performance variations in HPC and Cloud environments. However, they run kernels representing common HPC workloads and infuse synthetic anomalies to mimic anomalies observed in HPC systems, which may deviate from anomaly situations in reality. There exists research focusing on predicting other job features, such as I/O, CPU, GPU, memory usage and runtime in clusters. McKenna et al. [5] utilized several machine learning methods (kNN, Decision Tree, and RF) for predicting runtime and I/O usage for HPC jobs with training data from job scripts. Rodrigues et al. [6] predicted job execution, wait time, and memory usage with job logs and batch schedulers by an ensemble of machine learning algorithms such as RF and kNN. Fan et al. [7] proposed an online runtime adjustment framework for trade-off between prediction accuracy and underestimation rate in job runtime estimates. Additionally, others have worked on log file analysis with machine learning, anomaly detection and so on. In this work, we use system log data collected by ganglia to predict whether a job runtime was underestimated. We found that our method has particularly good results at predicting underestimated runtime for some applications after splitting the entire job data set into subset categorized by scientific application name. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to analyze job data and build models according to different HPC scientific applications using machine"

84,620,0.229,Eye Tracking Methodology,"as a quadrilateral mesh, was divided into fixed-size (number of vertices) subblocks, allowing rendering for variable LOD on a per-subblock basis. From a fully detailed surface, lower levels of resolution were constructed by removing half of the vertices in each direction and assigning new vertex values. The new values were averages of the higher resolution values. Resolution level was chosen per sub-block, based on viewer distance. The resolution level was not discrete; it was interpolated between the precomputed discrete levels to avoid âpoppingâ effects. The terrain, prior to gaze-contingent alteration, is shown in Fig. 24.9. Rocks in the terrain are rendered by billboarding; i.e., images of rocks from the Pathfinder mission to Mars were rendered onto 2D transparent planes that rotate to maintain an orientation orthogonal to the viewer. Two views of the gaze-contingent environment (shown rendered and in wireframe) are seen in Figs. 24.10 and 24.11. To exaggerate the gaze-contingent effect, in this environment, fractal mountains appear and disappear from view, based on direction of gaze. Notice also, in Fig. 24.10a, b, the increased resolution (number of quads) below the gaze vector. The images in the figure are snapshots of the scene images generated by the eye tracker; i.e., what is seen by the operator (the point of regard crosshair, coordinates, and video frame timecode) is not seen by the viewer immersed in the environment. More recent work on gaze-contingent LOD modeling has been carried out by Luebke and Erikson (1997). The authors present a view-dependent LOD technique suitable for gaze-contingent rendering. Although simplification of individual geometric objects is discussed in their work, it appears the strategy is ultimately directed toward solving the interactive âwalkthroughâ problem (Funkhouser and SÃ©quin 1993). In this application, the view-dependent LOD technique seems more suitable to the (possibly) gaze-contingent rendering of an entire scene or environment. Recently, the authors have developed a gaze-directed LOD technique to facilitate the gaze-contingent display of geometric objects (Luebke et al. 2000). To test their rendering approach the authors employed a table-mounted monocular eye tracker to measure the viewerâs real-time location of gaze over a desktop display. This work shows the feasibility of employing an eye tracker, however the implementation framework used by the authors lacked a head tracker and required a chin rest to ensure tracker accuracy. A new object-based LOD method has been developed by Murphy and Duchowski (2001). The technique is similar to Luebke and Erikson and to Ohshima et al., where objects are modeled for gaze-contingent viewing. Unlike the approach of Ohshima et al., resolution degradation is applied nonisotropically; i.e., objects are not necessarily degraded uniformly. The spatial degradation function for LOD selection differs significantly from the area-based criterion originally proposed by Clarke. Instead of evaluating the screen coverage of the projected object, the degradation function is based on the evaluation of visual angle in world coordinates. System performance measurements are reported, obtained from experiments using a binocular eye tracker built into an HMD. Tracking software obtains helmet position and orientation in realtime and calculates the direction of the userâs gaze. The geometric modeling technique developed for the purpose of gaze-contingent rendering includes an integrated approach to tiling, mapping, and remeshing of closed surfaces. A three-dimensional"

356,171,0.228,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Authoring Widget-Based Learning Designs with the Composer From a userâs point of view, the Composer is intended to provide Learning Designers and Teachers with the means to compose and re-use Learning Activities and augment them with Learning Resources. We interpreted this process as a Widget aggregation. A typical usage scenario of the Composer can be given alongside the âtypical usage scenario for learning resourcesâ (see Van Assche et al. 2006): â¢ Discovering: A Teacher who wants to create a Learning Design for use in the classroom uses the Composer to search for existing Learning Designs, which seem to fit the particular learning outcomes she has in mind. Having discovered an interesting Learning Design, she evaluates it both according to her personal criteria. Before Teacher begins with augmenting the Learning Design, she creates a personalized copy within the Composer. â¢ Repurpose and Re-use: This is the central step, where a Teacher modifies the Learning Design according to her personal needs. In doing so, the Teacher aggregates (references to) Widgets from the Widget Store. For example, the Teacher enriches the Learning Activity with concrete Learning Resources. The result of this mashup process is a personalized Learning Design that is augmented with concrete resources. â¢ Publishing: In case the Teacher decides to publish this Learning Design, the Composer makes it available to others in a public area, so that it can be reused in other âdevelopment cyclesâ. Moreover, a Learning Design Widgetârepresenting the interoperable output representationâis generated3 and published into the Widget Store. Technically, driven by the non-functional requirement for interoperability, the Composer was implemented as a highly embeddable web application. To this end, the Composer seamless integration via the emerging IMS Learning Tools Interoperability4 (LTI) protocol and implements a responsive user interface.5 LTI enables a seamless integration into for example in the DotLrn learning management system as far as identity management is concerned. Hence, a DotLrn user can directly access the Composer via DotLrn using her DotLrn user account. Once logged into the Composer the user can start to compose a Learning Design. A user can start composing also by reusing other Learning Designs. This is supported by a browse functionality and a copy feature that allows her to copy an existing Learning Design into her personal workspace. At the personal workspace a user can create new and alter existing Learning Designs. Users are also encouraged to publish their private Learning Designs to the public space, where they can again be found by other users."

Many of these articles remain standard references, used as a basis for extending the methods and procedures of group-score assessments. In addition, Mislevy (1991, 1993a, b) continued work on related issues. A significant extension to the large-scale assessment work was a partnership with Statistics Canada that resulted in development of the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). IALS collected data in 23 countries or regions of the world, 7 in 1994 and an additional 16 in 1996 and 1998 (Kirsch et al., Chap. 9, this volume). Also in this period, ETS research staff helped the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) move the TIMSS 1995 and 1999 assessments to a more general IRT model, later described by Yamamoto and Kulick (2002).

221,10,0.227,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Abstract Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Asia accounted for approximately 38 % of global emissions in 2005. Considering the rapid economic growth expected in the coming decades, emissions from Asia in 2050 are projected to double the 2005 levels if efforts are not made toward achieving low-carbon societies (LCSs). The reduction of emissions in Asia is imperative for the transition by 2050 to an LCS worldwide that has halved GHG emissions. The LCS transition by Asian countries will not be an easy task. In order to accomplish this transition, it is vital that stakeholders including central and local governments, private sector enterprises, NGOs and NPOs, citizens, and the global community tackle it with a focused and common vision of the society they wish to achieve, while cooperating with one another and being aware of the roles they need to play. In addition, careful attentions should be placed on the diversity of the Asian countries when it comes to the implementation of countermeasures. Depending on the country or region in Asia, the level of development, amount and type of resources, climate conditions, culture, and other factors differ, and the actions that are effective may vary accordingly. In order to analyze the feasibility, in this study two future scenarios, namely, advanced society scenario and conventional society scenario, are developed. In addition, âTen Actions toward Low Carbon Asia,â a guideline to plan and implement the strategies for an LCS in Asia, was developed. The ten actions are the following: Action 1: Hierarchically connected compact cities Action 2: Mainstreaming rail and water in interregional transport Action 3: Smart ways to use materials that realize the full potential of resources Action 4: Energy-saving spaces utilizing sunlight and wind Action 5: Local production and local consumption of biomass Action 6: Low-carbon energy system using local resources Action 7: Low-emission agricultural technologies T.

2,363,0.227,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"This dimension exhibits fewer differences between service areas. All municipalities conduct user surveys, and these are administered in all institutions except nonproï¬t schools. User surveys are the only opportunity for direct communication between users and local policymakers. In addition, municipalities have arenas for representatives of institutions to participate. For nursing homes, there is no difference between public, for-proï¬t and nonproï¬t institutions when it comes to their participation in these arenas. For schools, the more detached nonproï¬t schools are more isolated when it comes to participation. This is partly because local policymakers have less influence over what happens at nonproï¬t schools. It is a curious situation, since issues discussed in these arenas often include more than municipal school policies and are thus of interest also to the parents of children in nonproï¬t schools. The implication here is that a trade-off exists between empowerment at institutions and participation and influence in local policy process. The institutions where users have more local influence get less attention and less room for influence from the municipal level. This gives them more room to manoeuvre locally but also gives them less administrative support. Albeit to varying degrees, municipalities are important for all these institutions, and so to be excluded from the municipal decision-making structure undermines the opportunities citizens have to influence decision making in their communities. For policymakers, the exclusion of citizens from platforms for communication with them can present a skewed view of the opinions of citizens, especially those who by deï¬nition have taken an active stance on particular welfare issues. There is some variance between countries. In Denmark, user boards at nursing homes can report about successes in changing municipal policy, and interactions with local policymakers are a natural part of their tasks. This also happens in Norway, but to a lesser extent, while in Sweden it is all but absent. For schools, divisions between the strong influence of public schools and the lack of influence of nonpublic schools are evident across countries. The greater presence of participation in Denmark can be seen in the light of Scandinavian countriesâ respective âpower studiesâ, where the Danish research team drew more optimistic conclusions about the state of democracy on the basis of investigations into the implementation of policies (Andersen 2006)."

Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used until infection is ruled out (Cornell et al. 2015). If cultures are negative, symptoms remain after 48â72 h of antibiotic treatment and other etiologies can be excluded, corticosteroid treatment can be initiated. Methylprednisolone in doses of 1â3 mg/kg/ day i.v. are recommended until symptoms begin to subside. Response to treatment is usually seen within 2â3 days. Corticosteroids could then be switched to oral administration and should be slowly tapered. Early intervention with steroids prevents progression to more severe manifestations, and in the vast majority (80%) of patients, there is then complete resolution in less than 6 days. In cases with no response to steroid treatment after 72 h, biopsies of affected organs may be necessary. If biopsies are performed for evaluation of diarrhoea, the findings may not be able to distinguish from GvHD. This does however not exclude ES since overlap and coexistence with GvHD is possible. If a biopsy supports the ES diagnosis treatment with additional immune suppressants should be started and continued until response. If the result of the biopsy is an alternative diagnosis, the patient should be treated accordingly. In addition to pharmacological treatment supportive care with i.v. fluids, with electrolyte supplement as needed, and oxygen therapy may be necessary depending on the symptoms. In cases of encephalopathy or severe ES with MOF, plasma exchange may be considered (Yeoung-Hau and Syed 2014)."

In light of this general framework, we have demonstrated that integration is a situated and lived experience, the product of the balance between different factors. Within the same area there are places where people live together apart and places in which people conflict. These conflicts are not always between natives and immigrants, but often between groups of people with different ages. Conflict resolutions depend on the presence of individuals who are able to mediate, as was the case with the Via Montanaro gardens in Barriera di Milano or with Giardini SPA in San Paolo. Mediation works well when there is a bottom-up approach, which is implemented by people living in the territory, such as the elderly members of the Peruvian Community or mentally ill persons employed by the local association. In order to produce an enduring change in the neighbourhoods, the initiatives spontaneously generated from below need to be supported by local institutions, as was the case with the public baths. This is a place where the diversification of the differences is not a threat but a value for the area and it can become a replicable practice elsewhere. Despite these differences, both neighbourhoods seem to benefit from the strong identity and social cohesion that flourished during the industrial development, so that conflictual inter-group relations have thus far been channelled into organized solutions promoted by local institutions or citizens. Nevertheless, the leeway for managing antagonistic dynamics through formal and informal mediation seems to be decreasing due to the economic transition, the current crisis, and social changes."

285,136,0.224,"Physiology, Psychoacoustics and Cognition in Normal and Impaired Hearing","Bilateral cochlear implantation seeks to restore the advantages of binaural hearing to the profound deaf by providing binaural cues that are important for binaural perception, such as binaural fusion, sound localization and better detection of signals in noise. Most bilateral cochlear implant (BiCI) users have shown improvements compared to their ability when only one CI was used. However, compared to normal hearing (NH) individuals, the average performance of BiCI users is still worse and has a large variability in performance amongst them (Majdak et al. 2011; Litovsky et al. 2012; Goupell et al. 2013; Kan et al. 2013). One likely reason for the worse performance of BiCI users is the interaural electrodes mismatch between two CIs because of different surgery insertion depth or different implant length. Since the inputs to the NH binaural system from the two ears can be assumed to be well matched and binaural brainstem neurons are comparing only by interaurally place matched inputs, it is very important to determine interaural electrode pairs for frequency matching the electrode arrays in the two ears to compensate for any differences in the implanted cochleae. This interaural electrode pairing (IEP) is expected to become even more relevant in the future, to better exploit recent time information preserving coding strategies and with the advent of truly binaural cochlear implants, which will preserve, enhance, and/or optimize interaural cues. It has been suggested that physiological measures of binaural interactions (e.g., evoked potentials) will likely be required to accomplish best-matched interaural electrode pairs (Pelizzone et al. 1990). More recently, the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (eABRs) have been obtained in both animals (Smith and Delgutte 2007) and humans (He et al. 2010; Gordon et al. 2012). Smith and Delgutte (2007) proposed a potential way by using evoked potentials to match interaural electrode pairs for bilaterally implanted cats. Their study shows that the interaural electrode pairings that produced the best aligned IC activation patterns were also those that yielded the maximum BIC amplitude. More recently, He et al. (2010) observed some evidence of a BIC/electrodeoffset interaction at low current levels. In another follow up study, they used the same electroencephalography (EEG) procedure to examine whether the BIC amplitude evoked from different electrode pairings correlated with an interaural pitch comparison task (He et al. 2012). Their results show that there is no significant correlation between results of BIC measures and interaural pitch comparisons on either the individual or group levels. Gordon et al. (2012) demonstrated that binaural processing in the brainstem of children using bilateral CI occurs regardless of bilateral or unilateral deafness; it is disrupted by a large but not by a small mismatch in place of stimulation. All these studies suggest that BIC could be a potentially approaches for electrode pairing, especially for pediatrics, however, it is not accurate enough in all existing studies of human subjects. In order to tackle the issue of accuracy, a 61-channel monaural and binaural eABR recording setup was developed together with a multi-step offline post-pro-"

282,131,0.222,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"for the accounting practices of non-profit organisations. They then discuss requirements for reports to internal governing bodies, donors and public authorities. Relevant and broadly accepted criteria for the accounting practices of nonprofit organisations, which can be applied to advocacy and awareness-raising partnerships, have been defined in several documents. Firstly, as already mentioned, the UK Charity Commissionâs SORP on Accounting and Reporting for Charities is a widely used reference document. It often refers to principles laid down by the UK Financial Reporting Council and its Accounting Standards Board. This body defines Statements of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAPs) and Financial Reporting Standards (FRSs), most of which also apply to NGOs or charities.16 Secondly, due to the large number of non-profit organisations registered in or financed by the US, the Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP) in force there also enjoys wide recognition. The main institution defining GAAP for charities in the US is the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Its statements 93, 116, 117, 124 and 136 set down important accounting practices.17 These documents contain an emerging consensus on accounting rules that are specific to non-profit organisations and go beyond or deviate from generic good accounting practices: â¢ Non-profit organisations should distinguish their incomes and assets depending on whether or not their use has been restricted by donors. They should also include certain in-kind contributions of services as incomes.18 â¢ Non-profits should account separately for expenses related to their mission or function and those amounting to overhead costs.19 â¢ Non-profit organisations should also, like companies, report the gains and losses made on assets and investments. In doing so, they should report assets and investments at their fair value and take account of depreciation.20 Detailed and broadly accepted accounting standards, then, have been defined for charitable organisations and NGOs. Since advocacy and awareness-raising partnerships are functionally similar to non-profit organisations, they should comply with these accounting standards. Based on the information generated through the accounting system, partnerships should also prepare regular financial and activity reports. The authority over financial resources allowing a partnership to cover its operational costs is often delegated by various parties. Partnerships should therefore issue reports at different levels, including reports to internal supervisory bodies, reports to donors and reports to host organisations or fiscal authorities. To date, only few broadly accepted standards for those reports have emerged. The issue is further complicated by the fact that requirements differ depending on the addressees and the purposes pursued by individual reports."

SCIAMACHY has demonstrated the feasibility, but higher spatial resolution measurements and improved sampling are needed to unambiguously measure point sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4. The GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) was launched on 23rd of January 2009. The instrument TANSO-FTS (Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observations - Fourier Transform Spectrometer) has now made over four years of measurements in space (Hamazaki et al. 2004). The measurements have higher spectral resolution and contain potentially more information than those of SCIAMACHY but have poorer sampling. The OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) was selected by NASA but the OCO-1 launch vehicle failed in February 2009 (Crisp et al. 2004). OCO aims to make high spatial resolution measurements of the dry column of CO2 and OCO2 is now planned for launch in 2014. Based on the success of SCIAMACHY, the MaMap instrument was developed in 2006 to demonstrate that high spatially resolved measurements, e.g. 50 m, and high signal to noise of the total dry mole fraction of CO2 and CH4 are feasible from aircraft (Gerilowski et al. 2011). The results of MaMap have been used to retrieve surface fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from point sources.

45,518,0.221,Measurement and Control of Charged Particle Beams,"9.9 Septa As we have seen in (9.1) and (9.4), a small septum thickness dsep reduces the requirements on the kicker and increases the extraction efficiency. For this reason, electrostatic wire septa have been employed since many years, for example, during fast extraction at the Fermilab Tevatron [26]. The Tevatron electrostatic septum consists of two 354 cm long sections with 86 cm space in between, made from 75% tungsten and 25% rhenium wires of 0.002 inch diameter and 0.1 inch spacing with an angle of 25 Âµrad between sections. The voltage of 93 kV results in an electric field of 83 kV/cm [26]. Very similar electrostatic deflectors have been proposed for the muon collider [27]. At high energies, the integrated strength of a wire septum often cannot provide a deflection angle large enough for clean extraction, and, in such cases, an additional thin septum magnet is positioned immediately downstream. In general, two types of septum magnets are widely used [28]: Lambertson iron septum dipoles and current-carrying septum dipoles. A Lambertson magnet is illustrated in Fig. 9.14. The triangular cut-out in the window frame leaves space for the circulating beam. As shown, a kicker deflects the beam horizontally into the septum, by which it is then bent vertically. Figure 9.15 depicts a current sheet septum. A current carrying septum with thickness d and current density J generates a field B = Î¼0 Jd.

Analysis of microbial community structures (Dick and Tebo 2010; Dick et al. 2013; Sunamura et al. 2004) and metagenome/transcriptome (Anantharamana et al. 2013; Dick et al. 2013; Lesniewski et al. 2012) also has shown sulfur oxidation, ammonium oxidation, aerobic methane oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, and heterotrophic activity in the plumes. Microbial community structures based on SSU rRNA genes in the plumes have been studied in MOR hydrothermal systems including, for example, Guaymas Basin (Dick and Tebo 2010), Juan de Fuca Ridge (Lam et al. 2008) at the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Mid Cayman (German et al. 2010) at the Mid Cayman Rise, and Kairei Field (Noguchi et al. Chap. 15) at the Central Indian Oceanic Ridge (CIR). These hydrothermal fields are categorized into methane, sulfur, and hydrogen TAIGA fields. In contrast, there has been little study related to microbial communities in arc/backarc hydrothermal systems in subduction region. Only a hydrothermal plume at the Suiyo Seamount (Sunamura et al. 2004) located on the Izu-Ogasawara Arc has been studied. Figure 3.1 shows the microbial community structures in the plume of arc/backarc hydrothermal system, which we collected and analyzed as a representative of methane and sulfur TAIGA. The key microbial lineages in hydrothermal plumes are selected based on a review paper of microbial studies in hydrothermal plumes and anoxic seawater (Dick et al. 2013). In these key microbial linages, the SUP05 phylotype is recognized as the most abundant and universal species in deep-sea hydrothermal plumes of all over the world. The SUP05 phylotype in these plumes was first documented in the Suiyo Seamount hydrothermal plume (Sunamura et al. 2004), and the SUP05 phylotype has been found to be dominant in many anoxic seawater sites (Lavik et al. 2009; Walsh et al. 2009) all over the world. SUP05 is known to be a close relative to symbionts of hydrothermal chemosynthetic mytilids and vesicomyids (Duperron et al. 2005; Fujiwara et al. 2000). These can grow chemolithoautotrophically with sulfur (Marshall and Morris 2012; Walsh et al. 2009) or H2 (Anantharamana et al. 2013; Petersen et al. 2011) as an electron donor, and oxygen or nitrate as an electron acceptor. The representative isolate of SUP05 grow with thiosulfate, which is accumulated as native sulfur vesicles in a cell and, in addition to sulfur compounds, it can grow heterotrophically (Marshall and Morris 2012). This wide variation of energy and carbon metabolism may sustain SUP05 as the primary key species in hydrothermal plume microbial communities. We also found abundant Alcanivorax, SAR324, and several epsilon proteobacterial phylotypes in the plume microbial community. The lineages"

Table 2 shows greater differences in response rates with respect to the former occupation. Not surprisingly, we find that machine operators and workers in elementary occupations have the lowest response rate, whereas professionals and managers have the highest. While four out of five professionals participated in our survey, only three out of five machine operators did so. We expected clerks to stand out in comparison with production workers since the former are more used to filling in forms than their colleagues in manual occupations. Contrary to our expectations, however, we found that the response rates between clerks on the one hand and craft workers and machine operators on the other hand do not vary much, ranging between 60 and 66 %. Finally, the response rates with respect to sex confirm prior findings in survey research that women are more likely to participate in surveys than men (Voorpostel 2010:367). We find that only 59% of the men, but 69 % of the women responded to our questionnaire. In the next section we compare a series of socio-demographic characteristics between respondents and nonrespondents (Table 3). While for the respondents register and survey data is available, for the nonrespondents we only rely on register data. If we compare the respondents (all) and the nonrespondents (UEI register) we can see that the respondents are on average substantially older, more highly educated and were less often employed as production workers. By comparing the profile of respondents for each survey mode in terms of age, education and occupation, we get an idea about how different modes affect the socio-demographic composition of our sample. Twenty-one percent of all respondents completed the questionnaire online, 76 % used the paper and pencil questionnaire, and 3 % answered by telephone. It is not surprising that paper and Table 3 Respondents characteristics by survey mode and unemployment insurance register status"
14,262,0.221,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"When we look at how the children negotiate identity among their friends, the participants express how identity is a situational construction. Some participants foreground or background their Asian identity according to which context and friends they are among. One participant foregrounds his Asian identity among his Danish friends, while another participant foregrounds her Asian identity when she is among her Asian friends. This shows that identity is changeable and complex, as one given situation can amplify either feelings of belonging or alienation. Only a few do not relate to different groups, which can be seen as yet another example of wanting to be included into the dominant group and not having an in-between identity. As seen before, the dominant discourse is powerful, as the fear of being othered is always present. One participant experiences this among his friends when they ask questions about his Vietnamese culture."

It is the institutions that have remained inside the walls!â Another man said that his communal council was also told to attend seminars by Fondemi but that they could not go either because of work. âThey are not responding to the needs of el pueblo, but to the needs of Fondemi,â he stated firmly. The next speaker said that he could only speak from personal experience and that he had just started working in the communal councils, but so far he felt that they had received satisfactory responses from the institutions. The next speaker said that they all had to exercise control over the institutions and that the institutions needed to have a flexible time schedule that suited people, not the bureaucracy. If not, people would become demotivated. In their case, they had started to work on a project for one of the bloques in their community, up in the El Mirador sector. The bloques were falling apart, and they had taken photos and had received visits from people from the institution. As there had not been subsequent follow-up from the state, the initial interest waned and people lost their enthusiasm. The woman from Fondemi then said that, certainly, within the institutions there were people who didnât work as they should and who hacen trampas (play tricks); âbut we, as revolutionaries are above this,â she said. Revolutionaries do not have their own lives, she continued. She used her own sacrifice for the revolution as an example, how she was working day and night, coming home late to her children. She acknowledged, however, that many people were working and could not go to all the meetings all the time. What the communities needed to understand was that the communal councils represented la nueva institucionalidad (new institutionalism), and that the communal councils were not only composed by the voceros, but by the whole community. âSo if the voceros cannot come, another member from the community should go instead,â she stated. She used their meeting as an example and said that those convoked were the heads of the communal bank, and they were there not only for themselves, but also for the whole community. They needed to go back and inform everyone about what had taken place at the meeting. âWe are all a part of the process and we all need to contribute to developing all of us,â she said. She continued talking about how the process of the communal councils was a âtrying, failing and learning process,â and that it was easy to blame the institutions when something went wrong.

These ânovel ecosystemsâ occur because the species composition and function of greatly altered ecosystems have been completely transformed from the historic system (Hobbs et al. 2009) (Fig. 13.4).

332,207,0.22,"Media Resistance : Protest, Dislike, Abstention","bad behaviour, is expressed in progressively severe metaphors such as âeducation for crimeâ (cinema), âeducation for terrorâ (comics) and âmurder simulatorsâ (games). The risks of online addiction and exploitation are expressed suggestively as being âcaught in the netâ and âtangled in the webâ (Young 1998, 2000). Moral arguments are consistent in the sense that subsequent generations of protesters have used similar metaphors and phrases to describe subsequent generations of media. Professionals and activists who react to the media on moral grounds often use strong and violent metaphors, prompting media liberals and scholars to describe them as panicky and irrational (Ch. 1). Clearly, the moral arguments against the media have become less pervasive, as moral norms are changing there is a greater tolerance for activities previously deemed amoral. However, moral campaigners can look back on a centuries-long tradition of protest, and can argue with some justiï¬cation that from their perspective, the warnings issued have not been that far-fetched; even if the copycat argument lacks empirical proof, the tremendous proliferation of mediated sex, violence and lewd content defy even the most dystopic predictions. This is only one reason why the liberal use of labels such as âmoral panicâ and âmedia panicâ to describe resisters may be inadequate; moral protesters may be entirely rational in their judgements even if they go against the social consensus. If the purpose is to understand why some react to the media, the use of a predetermined panic-label may not be the best starting point. The concern for culture, and the belief that the media should show âthe bestâ in different genres, is another fundamental position in media resistance and scepticism, spawning a range of powerful metaphors describing disgust and disappointment. Early mass culture was described metaphorically as âthrash,â âgarbage,â âpulp,â and later television, particularly commercial television, were criticized for driving culture towards the âlowest common denominator,â leading to âWall-to-Wall Dallasâ (McKee 2006). Television was metaphorically named âthe idiot boxâ and online and social media are criticized for leading to âdictatorship of idiotsâ (Keen 2008). The concern about the publicâs âwriting diarrhoeaâ in the eighteenth century (Krefting et al. 2014) parallels concern that âThe Internet is todayâs toilet wallâ (SÃ¸rensen 2010), hitting a new low in cultural standards. Like the morality argument, also the argument that popular media undermine culture is consistent and represents a âcommon senseâ approach in wide circles, although the argument has lost credibility"

272,398,0.22,Reconsidering Constitutional Formation Ii Decisive Constitutional Normativity : From Old Liberties To New Precedence (Volume 12.0),"4 Regulations in the 1815 Constitution Concerning the Criminal Law The decisive constitutional normativity of the Constitutions as developed in the end of the 18th century expressed itself i.a. as the requirement that statutory law should be congruent with the hierarchically higher placed text of a written Constitution.125 This ideaâof a legal system as a system combining various levels of normativity where regulations on each level have to be in conformity with that placed aboveâ has persevered, be it signiï¬cantly more sophisticated,126 until nowadays. Consequently, the particular laws, such as regulations in the ï¬eld of private or criminal law can be perceived as an extension, development or concretisation of the constitutional principles. Yet there is another important aspect of this hierarchical structuring of the legal system, namely that a written Constitution shall lie down the basic principles for all branches of law in order to enable to verify their âconstitutionalityâ, since otherwise this veriï¬cation process could not effectively take place. Correspondingly, in order to comprehend the development of this decisive constitutional normativity in the ï¬eld relevant for this paper it is necessary to outline those regulations of the 1815 Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland which pertain to the criminal law. Careful perusal of this normative act gives little reason to expect that any more detailed regulations concerning the criminal law could be encountered here, since already in the Art. 4 its narrow regulatory scope appears to be laid down very precisely: âThe Constitutional Charter determines the manner, the principle, and the exercise of the sovereign authorityâ. Yet no later than in Chapter II of the Constitution, labelled âGeneral Guaranteesâ lying downâas it has already been mentioned aboveâthe basic rights in the Kingdom of Poland there are incorporated numerous regulations concerning both the criminal procedure as well as the substantive criminal law itself. Above all there is a towering proclamation of the Art. 17: âThe law shall protect every class of citizens, alike, without regard to their rank or condition.Ë® More speciï¬cally for the ï¬eld of criminal law, the Art. 23 states that: âNo man shall be punished except in conformity with the existing laws and by the decree of the competent Magistrate.Ë® Further, Art. 26 in its third sentence declares that: âAny person attempting to appropriate the property of another shall be held to be a disturber of the public peace and punished accordingly.Ë®"

The accreditation process is continuous reflecting an established quality management system (QMS); therefore accredited centres are required to apply for reaccreditation every 4 years. In 2016, many transplant teams were achieving reaccreditation for the 2nd or 3rd time, whilst other centres are applying for their initial application. At the beginning of December 2016, the JACIE website (www.jacie.org) (2016) cited 334 successful initial accreditations; 197 successful reaccreditations from 26 countries had been granted since 2000. Although the initial aim of the accreditation scheme was a voluntary process, in many countries, health-care systems/ commissioners or health insurance providers and tissue banking authorities increasingly view JACIE accreditation as important and demand accreditation to allow the procedure of HSCT to be performed. Accreditation is the means by which a centre can demonstrate that it is performing to a required level of practice in accordance with agreed standards of excellence. Essentially it allows a centre to certify that it operates an effective QMS. Furthermore, due to the increased use of unrelated donors from different countries, interaction and collaboration between units are key elements for the success of stem cell transplantation. JACIE accreditation is a guarantee that the donor and the cellular product have been handled according to specific safety criteria. A QMS is a mechanism to: â¢ Ensure that procedures are being performed in line with agreed standards, with full participation by all staff members. In a HSCT programme, this ensures that the clinical, collection and laboratory facilities are all working together to achieve excellent communication, effective common work practices, shared policies where appropriate and increases guarantees for improved patient outcomes and the use of international donor criteria for related donors (Gratwohl et al. 2014;"
39,311,0.219,"a History of Force Feeding : Hunger Strikes, Prisons and Medical Ethics, 1909-1974","Hunger striking also raised complex questions about underlying medical problems that required treatment. Fourteen days into his hunger strike, Brendan McLaughlin agreed to receive treatment for a stomach ulcer. He was unable to sleep due to his stomach pains and was vomiting blood. A hospital consultant at Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast, warned him that he would be dead within four or five days if he refused treatment.160 McLaughlin raised an intricate dilemma. In essence, the point of the hunger strike was to die. But what if a prisoner died of a cause other than starvation? What if his or her protest aggravated a pre-existing medical complaint? Hunger striking could also take its toll on the psychological well-being of prison doctors. One doctor, Dr Ross, suffered serious problems with his conscience as he felt that he should insert a drip into a prisoner who had fell into a coma. Ross firmly believed that it was his duty to intervene in cases of starvation. He shot himself in the head on 13 June 1981.161 Evidently, the transition to permitting self-starvation raised multiple questions for prison doctors about how to manage, regulate, and observe the bodies of prisoners intent on refusing food. Doctors could adopt an observational role only, abandoning tendencies shown throughout the century to assert their power by resorting to the stomach tube to restore institutional order. The act of observing decaying bodies produced complex emotional responsesâin one instanceâresulting in suicide. Even despite forming part of a politico-military system in place to address political dissidence, many medical workers found it impossible to entirely discard compassion and empathy, to force themselves to over-rule their basic medical ethical inclinations and refrain from intervening by supplying food."

Die MÃ¶glichkeiten fÃ¼r den Informationsaustausch zwischen den FinanzbehÃ¶rden werden gleichzeitig ausgeweitet. Die Transparenz der VerrechnungspreisansÃ¤tze fÃ¼r die lokalen SteuerbehÃ¶rden wird hierdurch wesentlich erhÃ¶ht. WÃ¤hrend es in der Vergangenheit oft mÃ¶glich und angemessen war, einseitig nur den lokalen Teil einer Transaktion darzustellen und mit einer einseitigen Methode zu verproben, wird es in Zukunft nicht immer einfach mÃ¶glich sein, den Blick der Finanzverwaltung auf die GesamtzusammenhÃ¤nge im Konzern zu verhindern. Die Finanzverwaltungen werden durch den neuen OECD Dokumentationsansatz und das Country by Country Reporting wahrscheinlich einen umfassenden Blick auf den Konzern erhalten kÃ¶nnen (siehe hierzu die AusfÃ¼hrungen in Kap. 3). Zudem werden die Argumentations- bzw. die GestaltungsspielrÃ¤ume hinsichtlich der anzuwendenden VerrechnungspreisansÃ¤tze eingeschrÃ¤nkt, so z. B. im Bereich der IWG, hinsichtlich der RisikoÃ¼bernahme durch einzelne Konzerngesellschaften oder bei der Einrichtung eines Pools fÃ¼r die Finanzierung von Forschungs- und EntwicklungsaktivitÃ¤ten. Die Finanzverwaltungen kÃ¶nnen noch umfangreichere Informationen zu der tatsÃ¤chlichen Ã¶konomischen Substanz, zu Kontroll- und Entscheidungsbefugnissen Ã¼ber bestimmte AktivitÃ¤ten einfordern. AuÃerdem kÃ¶nnen sie eher als bisher den vom Steuerpflichtigen als angemessen gewÃ¤hlten Verrechnungspreisansatz umqualifizieren, weil ihnen ein anderer Ansatz eher vereinbar mit dem Fremdvergleichsgrundsatz und den neuen Kriterien der OECD erscheint (vgl. hierzu die AusfÃ¼hrungen in den Kap. 4 und 5). Die Rechtssicherheit wird durch diese Ãnderungen fÃ¼r die steuerpflichtigen Unternehmen sicherlich nicht erhÃ¶ht; eher steigt das Potenzial fÃ¼r Diskussionen mit den Finanzverwaltungen. Daher gilt es, sich auf die neuen Anforderungen aus dem BEPS-Programm einzustellen und die Substantiierung der gewÃ¤hlten VerrechnungspreisansÃ¤tze in der Verrechnungspreisdokumentation anzupassen oder aber diese hinsichtlich ihrer VerteidigungsfÃ¤higkeit im Hinblick auf die neuen OECD-AnsÃ¤tze zu Ã¼berprÃ¼fen und ggf. zu revidieren. Eine zumindest teilweise gute Nachricht ist sicherlich, dass die OECD fÃ¼r die Beurteilung der Verrechnungspreise einen international abgestimmten Dokumentationsansatz entwickelt hat, an dem sich bei der ÃberprÃ¼fung der Verrechnungspreise auch die Finanzverwaltungen orientieren sollten (siehe hierzu die AusfÃ¼hrungen in Kap. 3). Dieser neue OECD-Dokumentationsansatz ist einerseits relativ breit angelegt und enthÃ¤lt einige restriktivere und nachteilige Anforderungen aus Sicht der Steuerpflichtigen (z. B. das Country-By-Country-Reporting, regelmÃ¤Ãige zeitnahe Dokumentation, regelmÃ¤Ãiges z. T. jÃ¤hrliches Update der Fremdvergleichsstudien, PrÃ¤ferenz fÃ¼r lokale Vergleichsunternehmen sowie fÃ¼r ex-ante Preissetzung). Andererseits gibt es auch Bestandteile, die fÃ¼r die Steuerpflichtigen von Vorteil sind: so z. B. die MÃ¶glichkeit, die Dokumentation in Englisch einreichen zu kÃ¶nnen und die Definition von Wesentlichkeitsgrenzen fÃ¼r Transaktionen, die allerdings noch durch die lokalen Finanzverwaltungen zu definieren sind. Die Hoffnung besteht, dass dieser Ansatz in Zukunft geeignet ist, auch die meisten lokalen Anforderungen mit zu erfÃ¼llen, so dass die Steuerpflichtigen ihre weltweiten Dokumentationsanforderungen im Bereich Verrechnungspreise effizient erfÃ¼llen.

375,376,0.219,Musical Haptics,"11.3.2 Drum Teaching with Haptic Bracelets The Haptic Bracelets operate rapidly enough to be used for real-time synchronisation between musicians. This enables a drum teacher (Fig. 11.3, right) and learner (Fig. 11.3, left) to both wear a set of bracelets, and for the learner to feel in the appropriate limb which limb the drummer uses to strike each drum, effectively in real time [3, 29]. The impacts felt by each limb are detected in fast sensors, signals are sent by Wi-Fi, and the system uses fast acting, precise vibrotactiles. Figure 11.4 shows the control interface for tap detection of each limb of the teacherâs devices mapping them to the learnerâs bracelets. Consequently, communication delays are generally stable and under 10 ms. Taking into account the speed of sound in air, this means that synchronisation via the bracelets over a network can be as close as is generally achieved by musicians playing at distance of 3.5 m from each otherâwhich is considered real time for most musical purposes. Depending on the quality of the Wi-Fi router and other system factors, beats can exceptionally be delayed or lost, but because the key working principle is entrainment, occasional small disturbances do not matter greatly. Teaching in this way can be in person, over a distance, live or recorded, and oneto-one or one-to-many. Haptic Recordings can be played back later and slowed down for more detailed study, with limbs muted or isolated as needed."

Den Grossteil unserer Denkarbeit erledigen wir in dem schnellen, automatisierten Modus. In diesem Denkmodus handeln wir nicht sinngeleitet, sondern sind nÃ¤her an blossem Verhalten, da wir uns in diesem Modus mittels Routine und Heuristiken durch den Alltag manÅvrieren. Im Gegensatz dazu meint der langsame Denkmodus das bewusste, reï¬ektierte und explizite Analysieren und Ãberlegen, u.a. in Form von Metakognition, dem Denken Ã¼ber das eigene Denken (Amsel u. a. 2008; Fletcher und Carruthers 2012). Ist das Modell des zweckrational handelnden Akteurs, welcher auf die Verwirklichung von PrÃ¤ferenzen hinarbeitet, angesichts der teils automatisierten und unreï¬ektierten kognitiven Arbeit des menschlichen Gehirns haltbar? Ich denke, dass es das ist, aber in einer Form, in welcher die handlungsleitenden Motivstrukturen von Akteuren getrennt sind von der Frage der Realisierung der mit den Handlungen der Akteure verbundenen PrÃ¤ferenzen. Akteure kÃ¶nnen zielorientiert handeln und sie kÃ¶nnen dabei PrÃ¤ferenzordnungen haben â das bedeutet aber weder, dass die PrÃ¤ferenzen in irgendeiner Form umfassend oder wohlÃ¼berlegt sind, noch, dass die Akteure optimal auf das Erreichen ihrer PrÃ¤ferenzen hinarbeiten. Das Rationale an zweckrationalem Handeln besteht in dieser Lesart also nicht in der perfekten, aber realitÃ¤tsfernen perfekten Denkleistung von Akteuren, sondern in der mÃ¶glichen Motivstruktur der Akteure. FÃ¼r die vorliegende Arbeit unterstelle ich die Motivstruktur des zweckrationalen Handelns drei Gruppen von Akteuren und in drei Handlunkgskontexten: BÃ¼rgerinnen und BÃ¼rgern beim WÃ¤hlen; Parlamentarierinnen und Parlamentariern beim Legiferieren; Journalistinnen und Journalisten beim Herstellen Ã¶ï¬entlicher Kommunikation zum Parlament. Diese drei Akteursgruppen und ihre jeweiligen PrÃ¤ferenzen stehen in einem normativ aufgeladenen VerhÃ¤ltnis zueinander. In was fÃ¼r einem, erklÃ¤re ich zunÃ¤chst in Unterunterabschnitt 2.1.4 fÃ¼r die Beziehung zwischen BÃ¼rgerinnen und BÃ¼rgern, um spÃ¤ter in Unterunterabschnitt 2.2.2 zu erlÃ¤utern, welche Rolle zusÃ¤tzlich die PrÃ¤ferenzen von Journalistinnen und Journalisten spielen. 2.1.4 Die kommunikative LegitimitÃ¤t des Parlamentes Wenn Politik als das Herstellen und Durchsetzen allgemein verbindlicher Regeln verstanden wird, ist demokratische Politik eine solche Politik, unter welcher jene, die sich Gesetzen fÃ¼gen, gleichzeitig die Autorinnen und Autoren dieser Gesetze sind. Das ist, sehr kompakt zusammengefasst, das Prinzip der VolkssouverÃ¤nitÃ¤t. Nun ist es aber nicht problemlos mÃ¶glich, das Prinzip der VolkssouverÃ¤nitÃ¤t im politischen Alltag auch tatsÃ¤chlich umzusetzen. Dieses Argument ist nicht neu. So ist etwa bereits Rousseau (1762, S. 93) in seiner Analyse der Regierungsform der Demokratie berÃ¼hmterweise zu diesem Schluss gekommen:"
223,459,0.218,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Exploration of Interindividual Variability Over Time in a Case Contrast Approach In this section we again examine the key areas of out-of-home mobility from the above perspective and contrast selected extreme cases in their divergent trajectories. We use the total sample as a platform for overall comparison and provide background material and quotations, and figures to improve understanding of this diversity. In addition, Fig. 15.1 provides an illustration of interindividual differences in mobility as people age. In comparison with changes in satisfaction of the total sample, the changes in satisfaction of Mr. Lechner (80 years old) and Mrs. Dahlmann (87 years old) mirror characteristic developments over the 10-year interval (Fig. 15.1, panel a). Mr. Lechnerâs satisfaction with his out-of-home mobility options had decreased between the years 1995 (M = 10.0) and 2000 (M = 9.0) because of a severe illness. He recovered between the second and the third assessment and was happy about his new freedom: âThanks to my recovery it is possible to put more strain on my body, and I make the most of it for trips, hiking, and long-distance trips.â Together with his wife he walks at least five to six kilometers every day and does all his shopping and errands on foot or by public transport because they have no car available. He is still able to actively pursue his hobbiesâcooking, painting, and forming wood and other materialsâand because he experiences no impairments he said, âHence, I can be quite satisfiedâ (M = 9.0). The course that Mrs. Dahlmannâs satisfaction took was quite different. Her mobility-related satisfaction had increased between 1995 (M = 7.0) and 2000 (M = 9.00). However, she suffered from late effects of a cancer surgery and had to undergo operations on her veins and hip joint between the second and third assessment. Because the latter surgery was not completely successful, her mobility is severely restricted. She can still reach shops and services in the neighborhood on foot. However, longer trips are no longer possible: She gave up driving and is not yet accustomed to using public transport. Inside activities are only a little limitedâof course, my range is not large and that makes a big difference. But outdoor mobility and out-of-home activities are restricted....Actually, because of pain I walk with the aid of a cane anyway, and I feel extremely unsure as a result....The movability of my feet has decreased, and when I step down a curb or something similar I have to pay careful attention....In the past I loved hiking, even in high mountain areasâbut this is no longer possible. My activities are limited to what I have to do: shopping and what is necessary for daily living."

As is common in semantics of separation logics, the resources form a partial commutative monoid, and SLRâs separating conjunction is interpreted as the composition operation of the monoid. When defining the meaning of a Hoare triple {P } s {Q}, we think of the promise machine as if it were manipulating resources: each thread owns some resources and operates using them. The intuitive description of the Hoare triple semantics is that every run of the program s starting from a state containing the resources described by the precondition, P , will be âcorrectâ and, if it terminates, will finish in a state containing the resources described by the postcondition, Q. The notion of a program running correctly can be described in terms of threads ârespectingâ the resources they own; for example, if a thread is executing a write or fulfilling a promise, it should own a resource representing the write permission."

In [15], a qualitative model based on metrics extracted from source code repositories, mailing lists, and issues tracking tools is proposed. QSOS (Qualification and Selection of Open Source Software) [2] is a maturity assessment methodology that aims to compare and select FLOSS projects to be used by companies. QSOS evaluations are carried out in four steps. In the âdefineâ step, users must define different elements to be evaluated (e.g. features, license, and community). The âevaluateâ step assigns scores to each one of such elements. In the âqualifyâ step, users apply filters/weights to scores in order to verify whether a project is good enough to be adopted. Finally, the âselectâ step verifies whether the software fulfill the needs defined by the user. In spite of such a variety of models already available, we believe that some capabilities, not tackled by previous work, are important enough to justify the need for a new model. First, most of existing models provide no systematic instruments for measuring activities performance and, therefore, are highly dependent of a skilled evaluator to succeed. Second, social aspects are usually not addressed (except in People-CMM). Third, such models usually evaluate very specific subjects, such as productâs quality or benefits of FLOSS adoption, being helpful only for those particular goals. Finally, mixing qualitative and quantitative metrics to improve modelâs accuracy is rarely adopted in existing work."

The work of teaching involves a fluency of mathematical reading and interpretation, to surmise what 30 (or more) different children might mean, and preparing to ask questions or to probe wisely or to comment strategically, all in real and rapidly moving time. At least three kinds of reasoning and interpretation are involved. First is to consider the mathematical issues embedded in the task or problem. For example, this task involves interpreting the number line, including what is considered the âwhole,â what to countâintervals or tick marksâand how to determine the name of a point on the number line. That the point is named by the distance from 0 in terms of the number of intervals of a particular length (e.g., 1/3) embeds all of these dimensions. Reading childrenâs writing is supported if the reader has a ï¬rm orientation to the things that a childâs representation contains. Second, and closely related, is to anticipate how the children might interpret the task or decide on their answer. Knowing, for example, that many children might count tick marks instead of intervals or start at 0 instead of at 1 can help a reader to see and interpret what a child has written. Finally, this work entails a fluency in reading childrenâs written representations, including spelling, spacing, handwriting (formation and orientation of letters, numbers, and symbols), ellipses and missing words or letters, and the composition on the page (for instance, that their writing is often not linear from top to bottom). There is also the complex work of leading a discussion, often misleadingly represented as âgetting out of the wayâ and âletting the children do the teaching.â First, the teacher chooses whose work launches the discussion. This is a key and consequential decision. In this case, while circulating as the children worked independently, the teacher saw many different answers by different children. Her decision about whose answer to start with involves considering the particular children and how they are positioned in the class and how who gets the floor and is given recognition for their thinking influences that positioning. The teacherâs decision also involves thinking about the mathematical issues on which the children are focused and those key to her instructional goal. She chooses Aniyah to present"

Assuming a fixed shielding thickness where t r, the scale factor is proportional to r2. Thus, moving from macroscale systems with ~20-inch dimensions to microfluidic chips with ~2-inch dimensions can reduce the needed shielding 100-fold. This reduction could make it practical for radiochemistry chips to be used in benchtop situations instead of needing to operate them in specialized facilities equipped with hot cells and mini cells to shield radiation, thus removing one of the bottlenecks in PET tracer production. Integrating the fluid pathways of a radiosynthesizer into a microfluidic chip has other advantages as well. If the chip can be made to be very inexpensive, the entire fluid pathway can be discarded after each synthesis run, eliminating the need for developing and validating a cleaning protocol and associated documentation or cleaning the system on a daily basis. This concept of disposability is increasingly being used in macroscale synthesizers to simplify setup, cleanup, and compliance with cGMP manufacturing guidelines for PET tracers that are used in humans [4]. Disposable cassettes also provide flexibility: with a single synthesizer instrument, the operator can choose to install different disposable cassettes (with different pre-configured fluid path configurations) along with matching reagent kits to make different PET tracers [4]."

However, they were not the only ones. Many farmers believed that their shepherds knew more about sick sheep and so summoned vets infrequently to their farms.26 They also consulted country medical practitioners about the health of their stock.27 Wider medical interest is revealed by commentaries on sheep diseases that appeared in the medical press.28 Doctors investigated these diseases in private farmbased research programmes, in their capacities as appointees to government committees of enquiry, and as public health doctors who worked to prevent animal challenges to human health.29 for example, Dr David Hamilton, the key medical participant in braxy and louping ill research, studied sick sheep during hiking holidays in the Highlands. Reportedly âon the news of an animal dying from braxy he would take to the hill with the shepherdsâ. He also conducted enquiries into cattle diseases on behalf of the HAS.30 Other expert participants in sheep disease investigations included amateur natural historians, and professional life scientists who occupied recently established university posts in biology and agriculture. Their involvement reflected the importance that the farmers who sponsored and promoted these investigations placed on the environment as a contributor to sheep disease. farming discussions frequently referred to the health implications of geology, soil, vegetation, season, temperature, wind direction, the lie of the land, and the presence of parasitic ticks and flukes that fed off sheep bodies and whose existence was, in turn, shaped by the characteristics of the soil, season and vegetation.31 Similar factors were commonly invoked in discussions of human health, particularly within colonial contexts.32 However, they had special 26 Armatage (1894). 27 Tellor (1879). 28 for example: Hutchinson (1877), âThe Report of the Departmental Committeeâ (1906), âThe Pathology of Louping-Ill and Braxyâ (1906).

241,553,0.217,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Sea with its complex coastline and the many different processes modulating its response to global warming. Nevertheless, the question as to whether the rate of sea level rise in the Baltic Sea is accelerating is relevant for adaptation to climate change and other planning purposes over the coming decades. A preliminary indication of acceleration may be conveyed by a change in the long-term linear trends in two different periods of the recent past. Ekman (2009) suggested that the rise identiï¬ed in the Stockholm sea level record is accelerating because the trends before and after 1950 look different (Fig. 9.7, upper right panel). However, this simplistic view should be complemented, if possible, by studies that analyse jointly the observed evolution of sea level and the theoretical evolution that sea level should display as a response to anthropogenic climate change. A change in the rate of sea level rise may not necessarily be projected by numerical climate models. Most studies implicitly deï¬ne the concept of âaccelerationâ of sea level rise, possibly influenced by anthropogenic climate change, in one of two ways. The ï¬rst approach is to look for a long-term increase in the rate of sea level rise, while the other compares the recent rate of sea level rise against rates observed in the past. The difference between both approaches can be illustrated by the following example. Given a sea level record, the linear trend of sea level change in sliding windows of ï¬xed length (such as 30 or 50 years) can be calculated (Richter et al. 2011). If the linear rate in the most recent window is the highest, it could be claimed, following the second approach, that the present rate of increase is unprecedented, and thus possibly related to anthropogenic climate forcing. However, due to decadal variability in the rate of change, the linear rate in the most recent window may not be the highest over the whole record length. However, if the linear trends over the sliding windows itself display a linear trend, it could be claimed, following the ï¬rst approach, that sea level rise is accelerating in that particular record. In a variant of the ï¬rst approach, the"

170,476,0.216,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"intentions will be empirically examined in this study. Second, we expect those migrant workers perceiving greater seriousness of the problems they encounter and having higher levels of political efficacy to be more likely to express their opinions. Third, social networking and social capital are important resources for migrant workers to engage in expressive behaviours. Based on case studies, scholars (e.g. Guo et al. 2011) have argued that whether having everyday social network influences the action models of migrant workers when they are faced with serious problems, in the âatomizedâ situation where the primary social network is missing, they tend to resort to personal solutions such as suicide; the existence of social network (e.g. the hometown fellow organisations) will facilitate them to organise and take collective actions to protect their own rights. Therefore, whether having supporting social networks plays a critical role in influencing migrant workersâ expressive intentions, carrying out broader and more frequent social interactions with others will positively relate to their opinion expression. Fourth, as an important information resource, news media use is expected to facilitate expressive behaviours of migrant workers. The Internet has been viewed in a similar way. Scholars have argued that the Internet may contribute to citizensâ expressive engagement because of its abundant and diverse information, open and democratic discussion, and âhorizontal communicationâ (Polak 2005; Hung 2006; Shirk 2007). Empirically, in a metaanalysis of 38 studies with 166 effect estimates, Boulianne (2009) reports that online news use had significant positive effects on citizenship engagement. In China, the Internet has also been found to be positively related to engagement in general. For example, Lei (2011) showed using the 2007 World Value Survey Data that compared with exclusive traditional media users and non-media users, Chinese netizens were more likely to be opinionated, more likely to be âpoliticisedââthat is, simultaneously embracing the norms of democracy and being critical of the current political conditions and the party-stateâand more likely to have experiences in collective action. Chan and Zhou (2011) show Internet news use had significantly positive influence on opinion expression in the new media space, though it had no significant effect on offline expression. Following these theoretical arguments, we expect that the Internet also has potential to facilitate expressive intentions among new-generation migrant workers via various processes. First, as a source for abundant and diverse information, the Internet can facilitate steady and fuller information flows which serves as the basic resources for migrant workers to express their opinions. For example, when they are faced with labour protection problems, they can easily find useful information online which can help them to express their opinions with more knowledge and confidence. Second, the Internet can serve as an openly accessible virtual space for migrant workers to interact with others and organise to voice their own opinions. Scholars have argued that the Internet becomes an important space for migrant workers to interact with each other and to maintain and extend their social networks (Law and Chu 2008; Lin and Tong 2008), which can make expression much easier, be it labour issues or emotional issues. Third, both the information acquisition and interpersonal interactions via the Internet may facilitate their offline expression. Online expression is actually an exercise for marginalised people to engage in public affairs, and this"

If the Dean is waiting, then the 50th student in or the last one out has to signal lieIn. If the Dean is in the room (waiting for all the students to leave), the last student out signals clear. In all three cases, it is understood that the mutex passes from the student to the Dean. One part of this solution that may not be obvious is how we know at Line 7 of the Deanâs code that students must be 0 or not less than 50. The key is to realize that there are only two ways to get to this point: either the first conditional was false, which means that students is either 0 or not less than 50; or the Dean was waiting on lieIn when a student signaled, which means, again, that students is either 0 or not less than 50."

311,363,0.216,The Physics of the B Factories,"tial background from low momentum tracks can be reduced by correlating the direction of the slow pion and the remaining tracks from the Btag decay. Since the slow pion and the D0 are emitted nearly at rest in the DâÂ± frame, the slow pion direction in the Btag rest frame will be along the direction of the D0 decay products and opposite to the remainder of the Btag decay products. This direction can be approximately determined by calculating the thrust axis of the Btag decay products. The thrust is calculated using both charged tracks and neutral clusters not used in the reconstruction of Brec . The following variables provide useful discriminating power: â q, the charge of the track. â pâ , the momentum of the slow pion candidate in the Î¥ (4S) center-of-mass frame. â plab , the momentum of the slow pion candidate in the laboratory frame. â Î¸lab , the polar angle in the laboratory frame. â cos Î¸ÏT , the cosine of the angle between the slow pion direction and the Btag thrust axis in the Î¥ (4S) centerof-mass frame. â LK , the PID likelihood of the track to be a kaon. PID information helps to reject the contribution from low momentum kaons ï¬ying in the thrust direction. â Le , the PID likelihood of the track to be a electron. This helps to reject background from electrons produced in photon conversions and Ï 0 Dalitz decays. 8.5.4 Correlation of kaons and slow pions In events where both a charged kaon and a slow pion candidate (e.g. from a Dâ+ â D0 (â K â X)Ï + decay) are found, the corresponding ï¬avor tagging information can potentially be improved by using the angular correlation between the kaon and slow pion. A kaon and a slow pion of opposite charge (i.e. agreeing ï¬avor tag) that are emitted in approximately the same direction in the Î¥ (4S) centerof-mass frame can provide a combined tag with a relatively low mistag fraction. In addition to the information used to identify kaons and slow pions, the following discriminating variable can be used:"

144,565,0.216,25 Years of Transformations of Higher Education Systems in Post-Soviet Countries : Reform and Continuity,"whining about the weakness of the modern stateâs control over quality of education. A large step from a highly centralised system to a more democratic and self-governing one is perhaps not possible without some ambivalence and hesitation, which comes across in the early educational discourse. What is troublesome, however, is that an âimpersonalâ critique is fostered, âlimited to critical evaluation of the processes but not the actors behind these processes; the identification of which is crucial for understanding and overcoming the crisisâ (Fimyar 2010, 80). Interestingly, similar types of issues pertaining to the notion of crisis in HE were raised by academic staff and administrators in the case study by Shaw et al. (2013), conducted a decade after these weaknesses were originally noted in official documents. The study additionally documented the complaints of university administrators on low levels of autonomy in terms of financial self-management and of academic staff in terms of the structure and content of degree programmes. Levels of autonomy are not identical across the system, however, serving as a source of vertical institutional differentiation. Currently, three state HEIs have the status of autonomous/self-managed universities with greater powers over their budgets, academic curriculum and capacity to forge external links (Table 16.3). There is also a plethora of private institutions that enjoy relatively high levels of autonomy from the government in terms of their own income generation and spending, and to a certain extent over curriculum planning and implementation. Respondents in the case study conducted by Shaw et al. (2013) were drawn from a HEI that is less autonomous by formal criteria. Unsurprisingly, the accuracy of understanding of the status quo evident in the interviews was accompanied by an acute awareness of the informersâ own helplessness with regard to reality, with only occasional sparks of optimism and sense of agency from selected top-level administration or very experienced academic staff. The Law on Higher Education (2014) has made some notable steps in the direction of creating an explicit sense of agency in the system by introducing actors apart from the government and charging them with specific responsibilities. Specifically, in creating provisions for a Quality Assurance Agency, which is expected to function as an arms-length body, similarly to its UK namesake, the Law makes an effort to delegate important monitoring functions away from the Ministry. The Agency has not started functioning at the time of this writing, however, which makes it impossible to comment on the actual realities of its work and division of responsibilities."

IUGG and its Associations operate through more than 110 scientiï¬c divisions, commissions, committees, working groups, and services. IUGG holds general and scientiï¬c assemblies, during which policies governing the union are discussed and adopted, and research programs requiring international participation are formulated, coordinated, and planned. At the assemblies, national delegates of IUGG Member countries pass resolutions on important scientiï¬c and science policy issues, particularly related to natural hazards and reduction of risks (Ismail-Zadeh 2016). IUGG Associations work to set global standards for research, such as the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF 2014), the Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice (Bormann 2012), and the Guidelines for Professional Interaction during Volcanic Crises (IAVCEI Subcommittee for Crisis Protocols 1999). In particular, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame provides a realization (i.e., a set of coordinates of some points located on the Earthâs surface) to the International Terrestrial Reference System, a world spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth in its diurnal motion in space. World navigation systems are referenced either to a speciï¬c ITRF realization or to their own coordinate systems, which are then referenced to an ITRF realization. Precise navigation assists in monitoring natural hazards, particularly movements of landslides, lavas, lahar, and debris flows. IUGG Associations oversee eighteen geodetic and geophysical services, particularly those related to monitoring natural hazards. For example, IAG established an observing system â the Global Geodetic Observing Systemâwhich works with IAGâs international services to provide the geodetic infrastructure necessary for monitoring the Earth system including hazards and disasters and for global change research (Plag and Pearlman 2009)."
314,32,0.215,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"The connection of small-scale farmers to large business farmers through mutually beneficial contract farming (also called out-grower schemes) facilitates famersâ access to inputs, financing, end-markets as well as their participation in agriculture value chains. However, for Verdier-Chouchane & Karagueuzian 2016, a comprehensive transformation of the agricultural sector in Africa toward agro-industrialization requires investments in technology and innovation in order to improve the productivity of both land and labor. An example of the use of Internet to improve integration into value chains is the traceability of food and animals which entails displaying the lot number and the production facility name on each case of the product and recording this information on invoices and bills of lading (VerdierChouchane & Boly 2017). Innovation can also facilitate commercialization and enhance farmersâ access to broader markets and financial systems. For Moyo et al. (2015), this will ultimately allow the creation of modern integrated agribusiness value chain economies based on specialization. Domestic and international private investment in the agricultural sector has already caused remarkable changes in agribusiness in Africa with positive effects on smallholder farmersâ revenues and productivity (Kanu et al. 2014). In Chap. 10, Namalguebzanga C. Kafando considers Africaâs z advantage in agricultural products and its industrialization based on the exploitation of natural resources. The author confirms that their processing can enhance the value added of exports and Africaâs industrial development, especially in West and Central Africa where the value added of the manufacturing sector is very low. However, the author also reviews the obstacles toward industrial and regional value chains development in Africa and recommends some policy actions. He mainly focuses on the role of education and skills, transport infrastructure, governance quality, trade integration and the use of technology. In Chap. 11, Joseph Tinarwo focuses on the role that SEZs can play in transforming Africaâs agriculture and developing agribusiness markets. In SEZs, economic regulations are different from those of the rest of the country. By mainstreaming the administration, providing tax incentives and low tariffs, SEZs improve the business environment and facilitate the access to new markets and encourage the concentration of industrial"
77,274,0.215,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Incomplete Data Virtually every longitudinal study faces the reality of not having all assessments at all time points on all participants. For instance, in the illustration above, by the end of the study 50.4% of the initial participants were no longer in the study. Modern methods allow obtaining unbiased estimates despite the incompleteness of the outcome data Y. Under specific conditions (see Rubin 1976), any variable X that may be related to the reasons of data incompleteness in Y is called informative or auxiliary. For instance, older and less healthy participants are more likely to drop out of a longitudinal study than younger and healthier participants. Thus, age and health are informative X variables that are related to the probability of not providing outcome Y values. Informative variables can be added to a longitudinal model to decrease estimation bias. This is why it is of chief importance to measure as many potentially informative X variables as possible at the first wave of a longitudinal study, when attrition (i.e., incomplete data in Y) has not yet occurred. This information may be used in subsequent waves to lessen estimation bias (for more detail, see Graham 2009, and Schafer and Graham 2002). In the previous illustration, satisfaction with personal relationships was related to the probability of dropping out, so that its inclusion in the model does not only address an interesting substantive issue but also reduces overall estimation bias. In some situations it is desirable to have incomplete data, mainly to avoid other, more deleterious effects. For instance, to understand the interrelationships among a very big set of variables, it is not necessary to administer all variables to all participants. Doing so could introduce major fatigue and demotivation effects, which are likely to lower the validity and reliability of the assessments. Rather, it is possible to randomly create subgroups of participants, each of which is administered a reduced set of variables. What matters is that the subsets of variables overlap across the participants, so that all interrelationships among the variables can be estimated. If carefully planned, then, the administration time and participantsâ burden can be reduced dramatically, without increase in parameter bias nor the need for informative variables (McArdle 1994). In longitudinal research this feature may be of crucial importance. Researchers interested in wide segments of the life course (say, young adulthood, from age"

308,156,0.215,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"The situations that compromise integrity can be avoided by an institutional policy that realizes the convictions of its staff, and delegates the work that is against the conviction of one physician to another who accepts it. There should be no retribution for such act of conviction, but that does not rule out incitement for those who perform the act. The medical profession nowadays requires that the physician should not in any way impose or even propose any judgment to the patientâs beliefs or indulgences. If the patient, for example, drinks alcohol or takes drugs of addiction, or has multiple sexual relations or is homosexual, the physician cannot even advise him against this perilous behavior. This is considered an intrusion in the patientâs lifestyle, for which he/she, the physician is not even allowed to advise against. However, the physician is allowed to advise against smoking and obesity, but the decision of course should be taken by the patient without any instigation or prodding. But why the physician cannot advise against fornication, adultery, sodomy, drugs of addiction and alcohol is beyond our comprehension in the Muslim world. The physician should be a sincere advisor to the patient in matters that would affect his/her health, and if he fails to advise accordingly, he is failing in fulï¬llment of his duty. This attitude is considered paternalistic in modern medical ethics and interfering with autonomy. Let us agree that enforcing a certain point of view is deï¬nitely encroaching on autonomy, but there is no point in allowing the physician to strongly advise against smoking and obesity and provide the means to help the patient overcome these problems, and at the same time refusing to allow the physician to strongly advise against sodomy, adultery, fornication, drug addiction, and alcohol drinking."

Die Idee, dass Nachhaltigkeitsinnovationen aus Nischen heraus entstehen, wird in Konzeptionen zu Realexperimenten bzw. Reallaboren weiter differenziert. Es sollen MÃ¶glichkeitsrÃ¤ume fÃ¼r transformative Praktiken zur nachhaltigen Entwicklung geschaffen werden. Kritisch kann angemerkt werden, dass diese AnsÃ¤tze Fragen von soziostruktureller Ungleichheit und politÃ¶konomischer Machtverteilung ebenso randstÃ¤ndig behandeln wie die besondere Rolle von formaler Politik und Staat als Primus inter Pares in einer reprÃ¤sentativen Demokratie (Meadowcroft 2009). Die jÃ¼ngere Transformationsforschung schlieÃt an Ãberlegungen des Transition Managements und der sozialÃ¶kologischen Forschung an, geht aber in mehrfacher Hinsicht Ã¼ber diese hinaus. Der Wissenschaftliche Beirat Globale UmweltverÃ¤nderungen hat mit seinem Gutachten âWelt im Wandel â Gesellschaftsvertrag fÃ¼r eine groÃe Transformationâ die jÃ¼ngere Debatte zu Nachhaltigkeit und Transformation mit einem besonderen Fokus auf den globalen Klimawandel entscheidend geprÃ¤gt (WBGU 2011). AnknÃ¼pfend an das Werk âGreat Transformationâ von Polanyi (1957), der Transformation als umfassenden gesellschaftlichen Wandel beschreibt â illustriert am Ãbergang von der JÃ¤ger- und Sammlergesellschaft zur Agrargesellschaft sowie von der Agrargesellschaft zur Industriegesellschaft â und fÃ¼r die Wiedereinbettung der sich verselbststÃ¤ndigenden kapitalistischen Wirtschaft am Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts argumentiert, konzeptionalisiert der WBGU die groÃe Transformation hin zu einer dekarbonisierten nachhaltigen Gesellschaft als gerichteten Prozess sozialen Wandels. Im Unterschied zum immer stattfindenden sozialen Wandel als einer Grundkonstante menschlicher Gesellschaften zielt der Gesellschaftsvertrag fÃ¼r die groÃe Transformation auf einen intendierten sozialen Wandel. Die Transformation lÃ¤sst sich zwar nicht im deterministischen Sinne planen und steuern, jedoch sollen VerÃ¤nderungsdynamiken auf das Ziel Nachhaltigkeit hin initiiert und katalysiert werden. Die Nutzung des Begriffs âGesellschaftsvertragâ verweist auf die gerichtete Koordination von Akteuren aus unterschiedlichen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen. Im Vergleich zu anderen AnsÃ¤tzen der Transitions- und Transformationsforschung, die stark auf die (zivil-)gesellschaftliche (Selbst-) VerÃ¤nderungskraft setzen, betont der WBGU die besondere Rolle des Staates fÃ¼r die Nachhaltigkeitstransformation. Dabei wird dem Staat sowohl eine hierarchisch-regulierende als auch eine Nischenexperimente ermÃ¶glichende Funktion zugeschrieben. In Studien wurde die Verantwortung der Politik fÃ¼r eine nachhaltige Entwicklung sowie die Notwendigkeit der Weiterentwicklung von staatlichen Institutionen, um dieser Aufgabe gerecht zu werden, inzwischen weiter empirisch analysiert und konzeptionalisiert. Ãber die genannten AnsÃ¤tze hinaus erscheinen insbesondere weitere transformationstheoretische AnsÃ¤tze aus Politikwissenschaft und Soziologie potenziell relevant und sollten zukÃ¼nftig fÃ¼r die Analyse von Nachhaltigkeitstransformationen fruchtbar gemacht werden. Insbesondere die politikwissenschaftliche Perspektive zur Transformation von sozialen und politischen Systemen beim Ãbergang von Staatssozialismus zu Marktwirtschaft und Demokratie (Merkel 2010) sowie die soziologische Perspektive auf sozialen Wandel durch die von vermachteten Akteursbeziehungen, Wissens- und PrÃ¤ferenzÃ¤nderungen geprÃ¤gte, dynamische Interdependenzbeziehung zwischen gesellschaftlichen Strukturen und Praktiken wÃ¤ren hierfÃ¼r relevant (ReiÃig 2009).

His recent work uses the metaphor of mathematics as a âdorsal spineâ on which monsters, not beautiful creatures, are often built.

244,225,0.214,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","The demand for subscores has been increasing for a number of reasons, including the desire of candidates who fail the test to know their strengths and weaknesses in different content areas and because of mandates by legislatures to report subscores. Furthermore, states and academic institutions such as colleges and universities want a profile of performance for their graduates to better evaluate their training and focus on areas that need remediation. However, for subscores to be reported operationally, they should be comparable across the different forms of a test. One way to achieve comparability is to equate the subscores. Sinharay and Haberman (2011a, b) proposed several approaches for equating augmented subscores (i.e., a linear combination of a subscore and the total score) under the nonequivalent groups with anchor test design. These approaches only differ in the way the anchor score is defined (e.g., using subscore, total score or augmented subscore as the anchor). They concluded that these approaches performed quite accurately under most practical situations, although using the total score or augmented subscore as the anchor performed slightly better than using only the subscore as the anchor. Puhan and Liang (2011a, b) considered equating subscores using internal common items or total scaled scores as the anchor and concluded that using total scaled scores as the anchor is preferable, especially when the internal common items are small."
365,475,0.213,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"sustain this goal is represented by irrigation development. Given the limited size of effectively irrigated areas, the contribution of irrigated agriculture to total crop production is quite small at 0.9% and 2.3% of the total national agricultural production of grains â rice and wheat â and vegetables, respectively. According to the International Commission Irrigation and Drainage (ICID1) three main types of irrigation schemes are developed in Nigeria: (i) public irrigation schemes, which are under government control; (ii) the farmer-owned and operated irrigation schemes that receive assistance from government in the form of subsidies and training; and (iii) residual flood plains, where no government aid is supplied, that are based on traditional irrigation practices. Nigeria is considered one of the African countries with the largest potential for irrigation expansion (World Bank 2010). However, as precipitation highly differs across the AEZs, the potential to improve yields by irrigation is highly variable, and a strategic balance between rainfed and irrigated production has to be achieved to ensure effective management of water resources. The Nigerian government is pursuing several policies that encourage a viable structure of public and private irrigation with a balanced set of small-, medium- and large-scale irrigated production. In addition to rehabilitation and expansion of existing public schemes, the Master Plan for Irrigation and Dam Development proposes the construction of new dams and irrigation schemes to improve the overall infrastructure of the irrigated sub-sector. About 156 km3 of water is exploitable per year from superficial and groundwater resources; currently, only 5% (8 km3) is effectively withdrawn (FAO 2016). According to projections made in the National Water Resources Master Plan (NWRMP) produced by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA 1995), incremental water storage of 2 km3 per year will be required between 2012 and 2020 to meet the increasing water demand from the three competing sectors: agriculture (69%), energy (10%), and domestic use (21%). Since the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to current climate shocks and resource availability is likely to be exacerbated under future environmental change, achieving food, energy and water security in Nigeria will become more and more challenging. Previous works have addressed the analysis of climate change impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting high differences in yield projections across different AEZs (Lobell et al. 2008; Seo et al. 2008a; Thornton et al. 2009; Roudier et al. 2011; Webber et al. 2014), due to differences in climate data, emission scenarios and the modelling approach in simulating crop yield (Roudier et al. 2011). The majority of studies are based on a statistical modelling approach (Parry et al. 2004; Lobell et al. 2008; Seo et al. 2008a; Schlenker and Lobell 2010), which however assume stability of the relation between crop and weather. Accordingly, this methodology has a rather limited explanatory power, and is unsuitable for extrapolation outside the range of observed conditions within which it was developed (Challinor et al. 2009; MÃ¼ller et al. 2011; Rosenzweig et al. 2013). A minority of studies were conversely based on dynamical simulation of climate change impacts by applying more complex mechanistic process-based crop models."
381,484,0.213,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Further, Fig. 8.2 shows that middle class children13 are losing more ground relative to top-end children than are those at the bottom relative to the middle. The topto-middle gap has expanded from $68,600 to $169,300, or by over $100,000, from 1979â2010, while the middle-to-bottom gap rose from $29,500 to $41,900, or by about $12,400, over this same period.14 It therefore appears that the top-end children are leaving the middle (and everyone else!) behind and helps explain why most âmiddle classâ Americans worry about their childrenâs future socioeconomic status, and why we see consistent calls for inclusive prosperity and shared growth (Summers and Balls 2015). In a world where wages for most education groups are flat, as David Autorâs (2014; Fig. 8.2) recent review of full-time workers makes clear, one finds that incomes and wages are stagnant or worse for undereducated men, not to mention relatively flat wages over the past decade even for men who are college graduates. This phenomenon also emerges for women since 2007 (Fig. 8.3). Even if womenâs wages at the bachelorâs degree level have flattened since the Great Recession, womenâs rising wages over the longer term are in contrast to menâs, except for the most educated men with post-bachelorâs degrees. Beyond the diverging patterns of individual wages, the increase in assortative matingâwhereby members of the same social and economic class are more likely to marry each otherâsubstantially compounds income differences across families.15 Evidently, these âmatedâ high-skill parents are at a substantial advantage in comparison to lower-income men or women who fail to marry or partner and have only a single income to support their families. If anything, the Great Recession likely has made differences in wages and incomes much worse, as we see increasingly widespread differences in employment and wages by education and age, with income gains mainly above the bachelorâs degree level, where the IGM correlation of parents and kidsâ education is highest (Fig. 8.3; Torche 2011). Cross-national research suggests that the premiums in pay for the highest educated are the largest in the U.S., meaning that the minority who attain a bachelorâs degree and beyond do most well in the U.S. labor market compared to their lesser educated counterparts (Autor 2014; Blanden et al. 2014; Ermisch et al. 2012). Much of this difference comes from the lack of progress in educational attainment in the United States compared to other rich nations (OECD 2014)."

Even before Inglis proposed it in open debate, it âhad been already discussed in the committee on the bill, and there rejectedâ, and Inglisâs attempt to revive it was voted down by a huge majority of forty votes to eight.256 However, Warburtonâs immediate response to Inglisâs reintroduction of the repeal issue into the 1829 debate offers important clues about why he chose not to include a repeal clause in the original 1829 Bill. When he had ï¬rst introduced the Bill, Warburton reminded the House, he felt âthe evidence was in favour of the repeal of this clauseâ but âafter conferring with â¦ those Honourable Gentlemen on whom the fate of the bill dependedâ he was convinced that for the bill to be successful âin this and another place (i.e. the House of Lords), it must contain no such provisionâ.257 The resounding vote against Inglisâs proposed amendment in the Commons (which then passed the bill without it) and the fact that the bill was then rejected by the Lords, where it failed to get support from key ï¬gures such as the Chief Justice, Earl Grey and the Archbishop of Canterbury, suggests that those Warburton conferred with were absolutely right.258 Moreover, although Peel deliberately kept a low proï¬le on the issue, he was also against repeal. In the May 1829 one of the MPs who responded to Inglisâs proposal expressed his regret that Peel had not bothered to attend the debate âto state the reasons which induced him, as well as the committeeâ, to reject it, and as current Home Secretary Peel he was almost certainly one of the âHonourable Gentlemenâ who advised Warburton to drop the repeal clause. Thus even at this point, after more than three-quarters of a century as a penal sanction, and after the almost complete disappearance of hanging in chains, the use of dissection as a post-execution punishment still had widespread support in Parliament and in government circles. However, those wishing to repeal the relevant clause of the Murder Act were not about to give up. Nor were the supporters of the much broader Anatomy Bill. Even though he could see that the 1829 Lords debate was going against him, Lansdowne still used that debate as an opportunity to suggest that âwhen another measure should be brought forward, he would certainly propose that the law directing that the bodies of malefactors should be given over for dissection â¦ be repealedâ.259 At the close of the parliamentary session three weeks later, Warburton duly gave notice that he intended to bring in another bill in the next session260 and although the political turmoil of the following year caused a temporary"

Both ODD and IDD employ a line buffer (Linebuf) and a FIFO. ODDâs datapath is connected to the output port of the FIFO, while IDDâs datapath is on the input side of its FIFO. Line buffers are, on the other hand, 1 line and 4 pixel long and are due to the 4 Ã 2 sliding window the downscaling algorithm uses (shown in Fig. 1). It is obvious that ODD needs a FIFO. While input pixels are received in raster order at a rate of 1 pixel per cycle, ODD consumes them at a rate of 1.8 pixels (due to the downscale ratio) every 3 cycles. Therefore, it consumes 1.8/3 = 0.6 pixels per cycle, and as a result the FIFO of input pixels builds up at a rate of 0.4 pixels per cycle. When the downscaler skips a line, then it catches up. It even sometimes leapfrogs the input pixels and waits for the FIFO to fill up as it has a cycle-time of 3 cycles as opposed to the ideal and slower rate of 3.24 cycles. On the other hand, it is not obvious that IDD needs a FIFO. However, if we have a non-stallable pipeline at the output of the downscaler, and/or we desire to minimize the amount of logic in that pipeline, we need to buffer the downscaled pixels in a FIFO and spread out the computations in the video pipeline that uses the downscaled frames over a pipeline heart-beat of âICT â r2 â cycles. ODDâs FIFO is a special FIFO; unlike a regular FIFO, it has different width on the write and read sides. It is 1-pixel wide on the write side and 8-pixel wide on the read side. It is indeed a FIFO as all it needs is a push/pop interface with addresses (i.e., write and read pointers) kept inside. Its write pointer is the coordinates of the input pixel that is being received. Its read pointer is the coordinates of the downscaled pixel that is being currently worked on. However, the FIFO outputs 8 input pixels with addresses based on some arithmetic done with the fractional read pointer. Note that in ODDâs case, Linebuf can be merged into the FIFO. Figure 3a gives a procedural code for the downscaling algorithm implemented in this work. Figure 3b shows its Data Flow Graph (DFG). The schedule obtained by mapping this DFG to arithmetic units (columns of the schedule) is shown in Fig. 3c. Every operation in the DFG is named after its output variable. The subscripts of the variable (thus operation) names in the schedule indicate the index of the output pixel, i.e., its order in the video stream. We scheduled ED, SSF, and BlinI separately. While [5] does all computations in fixed point arithmetic, we do BlinI part in floating point arithmetic since the algorithmic verification model we are given by our image processing people does BlinI in floating point. The advantage of floating point is that it eliminates the engineering time to fine tune the decimal point location in fixed point. Therefore, ED and SSF use integer arithmetic units"
73,122,0.212,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"IWM has undergone several transformations, and although DRR is a more recent concept, it too has been moulded to suit speciï¬c local conditions at different scales. These evolutionary changes in both ï¬elds have sought to develop âself-generated processes of dynamic changeâ by a âsubstantial devolution of power to smaller territorial unitsâ within an overall system, thus we now see the emergence of community-based disaster risk reduction (Twig 2004) and participatory watershed management (McGregor et al. 2006; Gregersen et al. 2007), both of which can be suitably characterised by using elements of Friedmann and Weaverâs (1979) approach. However, the related connection between the two planning approaches is effected through the medium of water: as Gregersen et al. (2007: 2) highlight, âwater ï¬ows downstream, ignoring all political boundaries en routeâ and âmost of the things that people do to their land and water upstream affects the water quantity, timing of ï¬ow and quality downstream and, as a consequence, downstream land productivity in its various forms.â This applies equally in the context of disaster risk reduction as land use changes in the watershed can have profound implications for vulnerability as experienced by others (rural, urban and peri-urban) located downstream. This has clear ramiï¬cations in the context of rapid peri-urban change, particularly where marginalised lands are settled, and compounds vulnerability issues stemming from agricultural productivity in surrounding rural areas as well as urban water scarcity and food insecurity. In such scenarios, the watershed approach could be a crucial planning and policy tool for effective and efï¬cient management of natural resources, particularly in regard to reducing disaster risk and maintaining future food security in expanding populous urban cores, where high quality agricultural land is often a primary focus of conversion to other, more urban land uses. The watershed approach is equally important in the tackling of âwildlandâ ï¬res in the PUI, as water resources can form effective physical barriers for mitigation and ï¬re breaks, and natural water storage features become water reservoirs for ï¬re ï¬ghting operations. Wildï¬res regularly cause extensive devastation, affecting both poor and rich, in the USA, Australia, Europe (including Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece); and South Africa (Goldammer 2005; Ye 2005). The vulnerability stemming from problems associated with wildland ï¬res is particularly acute when the PUI is characterised by extensive forestry and tree-based systems as opposed to lands predominantly used for agricultural purposes. The demand for, and high value proï¬ts from, suburban development set in woodland areas exacerbates these issues which is one reason that wildï¬res often occur on the fringes of Australian, European and North American cities (Goldammer 2005; Ye 2005), although such risks and vulnerabilities are not unique to high-income countries; for example, wildï¬res have also devastated many periurban areas in Indonesia (Tacconi et al. 2007)."
44,47,0.212,Ethics and Civil Drones : European Policies and Proposals For The industry,"4 Insurance Regulations and Drones in the European Union The European Insurance Regulation on the insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators (European Commission 2004) requires them to be insured with some exceptions: among them, these include model aircrafts with a maximum take-off mass (MTOM) of less than 20 kg when used for non-commercial purposes. However, even though there is no deï¬nition of what a model aircraft is for the purposes of the European Insurance Regulation, it is assumed that it encompasses drones. Therefore, an operator is exempt from the insurance requirement if he/she uses a drone weighing less than 20 kg for non-commercial purposes (Farrarâs Building 2016). Moreover, article 3 of this Regulation provides the following deï¬nition of an aircraft operator: â¦ means the person or entity, not being an air carrier, who has continual effective disposal of the use or operation of the aircraft; the natural or legal person in whose name the aircraft is registered shall be presumed to be the operator, unless that person can prove that another person is the operator."
384,50,0.212,Practical Economics : Economic Transformation and Government Reform in Georgia 2004â2012,"Rules for state procurement are all about ï¬nding the golden middle ground. All state procurement is prone to corruption, not only in developing countries. Hence the most important objective for regulation governing procurement is to make the process as transparent as possible and minimize the risk of corrupt deals. At the same time, overly strict procurement rules will limit the efï¬ciency of the government and might make it impossible to acquire the best product on the market. For example, if the rules say that the government must always choose the cheapest option, high-end products will automatically be excluded from the process. Also, there should be different rules for different areas of procurement. Professional services, for example, cannot and should not be procured based on prices alone. Think of marketing, consulting, architecture, and other such intellectual property. Assume a country wants to advertise its investment opportunities in a certain industry, or promote itself as a travel destination on international television. Further assume that the cheapest bidder for the advertising campaign is a local TV station covering one city and half a dozen villages. Chances are that their offer, although it has the lowest price tag, is not the best deal. The most important prerequisite of sound procurement is a solid description of the goods and services to be procured. It should neither be too broad, nor should it be too speciï¬c in identifying a particular product if there is a possibility of competition. In Georgia, the best results in procurement were based on three success factors: 1. Electronic auction. The tender and the speciï¬cations are put online. Candidates register and bid online. This approach helps the government eradicate ambiguity and rumors. For example, one participant will often tell others that their company already has a pre-arranged deal with the government, and that the others need not even apply.

In general, also consider the following: â¢ Take notes that may help you to interpret results later on (GPS, land use history, farmersâ comments on management, type of soil, current vegetation, evidence of erosion, fire, etcâ¦). â¢ If using coring, a sample that comes broken in the first 30 cm (as a result of coarse stones/roots) cannot be used. Sampling has to be done again in another location nearby. â¢ Beware that if the soil is very rocky, there will be a risk of overestimating SOC stocks if using soil coring. Therefore, an estimate of rock content for a given plot should be given. However, an accurate quantification of rockiness is a very demanding task, as it would involve to purposely sampling several pits at each studied field. â¢ Always take note of what corer you are using (because of diameters!). It may be that you are exchanging between cylinders with different sizes for whatever logistical reason (e.g., cylinder with detachable cutting hoe vs. normal cylinder. These two have different diameters and will definitely affect bulk density calculations). This is very important, take notes. â¢ Be careful that the sampling hole does not get contaminated while taking samples, e.g., do not step on the hole, do not let litter or surface soil fall in, etc. â¢ After sampling a plot, the coring cylinders and scraper need to be thoroughly cleaned (have wet cloths with you). â¢ If using the auger, use the same depth intervals as those with the cores (0, 10, 30, 50). â¢ From the outside of the plastic bag, crumble by hand big clumps of soil into smaller parts, which will be critical for easy soil processing later on. â¢ Closure of bags: rolling them up releasing air from the bag and then close it, so that it contains as little air as possible. â¢ Take several pictures of the plot/subplot. â¢ As a matter of good practice, do try to fill in sampling holes with any excess soil derived from your digging. â¢ To calculate SBD using the auger, you will need to calculate the volume by filling the hole with sand, which is highly demanding and slow procedure."

228,507,0.211,Theory and Applications of ordered Fuzzy Numbers : a Tribute To Professor Witold KosiÅski,"17.2.4 Fuzzy-Based Tool for Gait Assessment The subject of the research-the quality of gait-is a difficult term for formal precise definition. It depends on the general public and varies depending on the group we consider to be the norm in terms of gait. If the precise model is out of reach, we can use the tools for imprecise information processing: fuzzy systems. Their main advantage is the flexibility, intuitiveness, and clarity of rules that are easy to describe linguistically. The concrete proposition here is the multicriteria fuzzy evaluator of gait (MuFEG) defined for the purposes of the study presented in this chapter. This tool evolved from the multicriteria fuzzy evaluator proposed in [21], the purpose of which was evaluation of multicast routing algorithms. The measure of proper gait is presented as a percentage, where is an ideal quality. Defining MuFEGâs basic model for a good quality of gait, assumptions have been made that the quality of gait in people with no stroke, that is, a reference group of respondents, cannot be lower than. The presented results were achieved by combining three different descriptors of a gait. In the version of MuFEG used in the present studies, these descriptors are represented by three fuzzy Mamdani-type systems. A general idea of such fuzzy systems and precise presentation can be found in many books, for example, [1, 15, 16]. Finally, their results are aggregated to one normalized outcome. Two concurrent MuFEG approaches are used. Their working names are 1b-25 and KFNc-25. Both are based on the same assumptions and the same rules. The first, 1b-25, is the classical fuzzy system with: â¢ Singleton fuzzification. â¢ Implication operator, MIN. â¢ Defuzzification is realized as implications and the middle of maxima (MOM) method defuzzification. The fuzzy set representing the ideal value for each gait parameter is constructed from the data given for the reference group, people without stroke. Each of them is a triangular fuzzy set (see L-R fuzzy sets notation in [6]) and is determined on all the available data. For example, letâs look at set good gait velocity (good-GV):"

Strict timelines for isolated benchmarks can limit the number of participants that go through the process of registering, training their algorithms and submitting their VMs. Having a continuous cycle of benchmarks (e.g. annual events) might attract more participants to adapt their algorithms in the cloud and eventually submit the results for the benchmarks. This is not always possible because of the strict timelines to run the benchmarks and analyse the participantsâ results for a finite number of competitions. â¢ Freedom to adapt the cloud platform: Apart from data security and confidentiality considerations, using a public cloud environment can impact the level of customization available to administrators. The provided management tools need to be used âas isâ, and little to no possibilities exist to adapt them to more specific needs. Scheduled maintenance operations can also make the platform unavailable or cause disruptions in the benchmark workflow. A private cloud may provide a more flexible environment to develop an evaluation framework. On the other hand, a public cloud simplifies setting up and maintaining the backbone of the platform and theoretically allows for limitless scalability. Choosing the right cloud computing option depends on the initial objectives of the benchmark."

Allerdings zeigen jÃ¼ngere Studien keine signifikante VerÃ¤nderung der SturmflutintensitÃ¤t, wohl aber der SturmfluthÃ¤ufigkeit auf (â¶ Abschn. 2.4.2.3). Weitere spezifische EinflussgrÃ¶Ãen sind die natÃ¼rliche Landsenkung im Bereich der deutschen NordseekÃ¼ste (â¶ Abschn. 4.1.2.4), eine verstÃ¤rkte Flutstromdominanz (â¶ Abschn. 4.2.2.3) und der damit verbundene stromaufwÃ¤rts gerichtete Sedimenttransport sowie Eintrag salzhaltigen Wassers (BÃ¼scher und Rudolph 2014a; Kofalk et al. 2014; Seiffert und Hesser 2014; Koppe et al. 2012; Daschkeit und Renken 2009). Jedoch wird erwartet, dass sich die ErhÃ¶hung des Salzgehaltes nicht bis zur HÃ¶he der GroÃen Elbinsel erstrecken und sich damit nicht im Hafenbereich auswirken wird (BÃ¼scher 2014; Kofalk et al. 2014; Koppe et al. 2012).

Allerdings befÃ¶rdern niedrigere OberwasserzuflÃ¼sse infolge lÃ¤ngerer Trockenperioden mit wenig Niederschlag diesen Effekt noch (BÃ¼scher 2014; BÃ¼scher und Rudolph 2014b). Die Ausbaggerungen und Eindeichungen und daraus folgenden VerÃ¤nderungen der Flusstopographie (von Storch et al. 2015, 2008) tragen ein Ãbriges bei. Der durch den Meeresspiegelanstieg zu erwartende Elbwasseranstieg (â¶ Abschn. 4.2.2.3) kann schlieÃlich in Kombination mit klimawandelbedingten hÃ¶heren Niederschlagsmengen und StarkniederschlÃ¤gen (Rechid 2011; Linde et al. 2014; Holtrup und Warsewa 2008) das Grundwasserpotenzial anheben und somit Einfluss auf die EntwÃ¤sserungssysteme haben (SchlÃ¼nzen und Linde 2014; Koppe et al. 2012; Daschkeit und Renken 2009). Da auÃerdem die NiederschlÃ¤ge vornehmlich im Winter zunehmen kÃ¶nnten, hat dies voraussichtlich eine hÃ¶here Belastung der Infrastrukturen gerade in der Sturmflutsaison zur Folge (BÃ¼scher und Rudolph 2014a).

141,384,0.211,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"Concerning the reactive power in the grid, the LMOs try to locally compensate. In case when the local capacitor banks do not sufï¬ce, a signal must be broadcasted (Reactive Load Control - RLC) to request additional capacitive loads be switched on by other LMOs. Overall, the load measurement and control architecture includes a number of geographically distributed LMOs and one local AGC for each of the power plants (see Fig. 28). The effectiveness of this reactive approach is limited, due to the delays in the transmission of AGC signals and the time required for adjustments. A more advanced approach (see Fig. 29) tries to predict the variation of the load based on SCADA measurements from various places in the network, and a forecasting of load variations [7]. The prediction function is based on a sampling of the real load over some past time interval. Although the AGC and reactive load balancing are still slow (in the order of seconds), a good estimation of the current state of the system, as well as the load prediction, require better time accuracy than in the previous case, and global time awareness. Indeed, if two consecutive measurements from a given location in the power grid arrive in reverse order, then the detected variation trend is reversed. If this reversal occurs randomly over a large number of measurements, then the whole predictive load balancing has, on average, no effect. In a worst-case scenario the order of a sequence of measurements can be altered such that the variations are ampliï¬ed, leading potentially to the activation of circuit breakers on some network segments. Speciï¬c timing requirement can be identiï¬ed for the two cases: A. Predictive balancing of active loads â in this case we assume that LMOs compete with each other, so they are not willing to use their local energy reserves to balance the load at other LMOs. In this case AGC messages are sent to the power plant to increase its power output. Similarly, when the load decreases and LMOâs storage capacity is reached, another message is sent to decrease the generatorsâ power output. Obviously, these are sent asynchronously by all LMOs. In order to ensure a proper ordering of these events at the local AGC Message Queue, all AGC messages must be"

307,132,0.21,Computing Characterizations of Drugs for Ion Channels and Receptors Using Markov Models (Volume 111.0),"4. A detailed model of a calcium release unit is presented by Hake et al. [30] and Chai et al. [9] used the largest computer in the world (in 2013) to simulate the calcium dynamics of a single sarcomere at the nanometer scale. Simulations of the calcium dynamics of a whole cardiac cell are presented by Nivala et al. [60] and Li et al. [49, 51]. The dynamics was analyzed in [98] using a model developed by Swietach et al. [95]. 5. The derivation in Sect. 2.2 of the system of deterministic differential equations based on the stochastic release equations is motivated by the derivation of Nykamp and Tranchina [63]. 6. The probability density function approach used to model calcium concentrations is taken from Huertas and Smith [35]. 7. As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the model illustrated in Fig. 2.2 relies on a series of simplifying assumptions. One additional simplification underlying the model given in (2.1) is that we assume that there is just one channel. In reality, the RyRs come in clusters of 10â20 channels, but here we assume that the effect of these channels can be added together in one big channel taking on the states of the Markov model in question. This is a major simplification that makes it possible to deal with the problem. The case of many interacting channels is dealt with by Bressloff [6] (page 112) for the case of a Markov model consisting of only two states (closed and open). 8. For readers who need to refresh basic notions of differential equations, we recommend a look at the books by Logan [53], Strauss [91] or [96, 100]. As mentioned several times above, we recommend LeVeque [48] for an introduction to the numerical solution of hyperbolic problems. 9. Systems of PDEs written in the form (2.22) appear in many different applications; see Bressloff [6], where other methods of analysis are also presented. 10. An introduction to operator splitting and an explanation of why it works are given by, for example, LeVeque [48]. Operator splitting for the monodomain equation of electrophysiology was used by Qu and Garfinkel [70] and the accuracy was analyzed by Schroll et al. [80]. Application to the bidomain model was presented by Keener and Bogar [45] and by Sundnes et al. [94].

222,412,0.21,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The GBM region experiences relatively few tropical cyclones compared with other terrestrial basins: the number of named storms in the North Indian Ocean for 1980â2009 was only seven per cent of the global total (Knapp et al. 2010; Diamond and Trewin 2011). However, the large coastal population around the Bay of Bengal means that the impact of cyclone-induced storm surge can be very large. The main seasons for tropical cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean are AprilâMay (premonsoon) and OctoberâNovember (post-monsoon), with the strongest cyclones tending to occur post-monsoon when the available heat energy in the upper levels of the ocean is the greatest (Balaguru et al. 2014; Karim and Mimura 2008). The strong stratification of the sea surface following the monsoon rain and river input has been linked to the development of intense cyclones, as it limits the loss of heat from the cyclone system to the sea (Neetu et al. 2012). Observation-based studies have generally shown no significant change in the overall number of tropical cyclones and depressions, but an increase in the frequency of intense tropical cyclone events in the Bay of Bengal during the month of November (Unnikrishnan et al. 2006; Karim and Mimura 2008). The observed increase in intensity since the 1970s has been related to increasing sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean, which provides more energy to fuel cyclones (Webster et al. 2005; Balaguru et al. 2014). Changes in tropical cyclone frequency, track and intensity could have significant implications for coastal Bangladesh, but changes in storminess are among the most uncertain of IPCC projections (IPCC 2013), and tropical cyclones are particularly difficult to forecast. Projected change in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones is discussed further in Chap. 16."

192,259,0.21,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In a self-reflective mood, during a conversation with Paula Curry, Cantor confesses that scientific research is not as straightforward as is sometimes suggested. Most scientists suffer from what he refers to as a âdissociative personalityâ (p. 113). On the one side, they are rigorous believers in the experimental method with its set of rules, bent on advancing knowledge (in other words: S2). On the other hand, they remain fallible human beings with all the accompanying emotional foibles (in other words: $). One of the gravest occupational hazards in science, moreover, is simultaneous discovery. Sooner or later, somebody else will have the same idea. Scientists are driven by one desire: recognition by their peers (the Krausses of this world), but in order to obtain recognition, priority is essential. To score a Nobel Prize, one has to be the first to reach the summit. Thus, the push for priority is enormous. And the only way to establish priority is to be the first to publish. In other words, due to the confrontation with arginine (the object a), the self-contained expert (S2) falls victim to disruptive desire, and this results in a split (Spaltung) between adherence to methodological safeguards (S2) and the desire to maintain his advantage, his momentum, so that Cantorâs eagerness to score ($) suddenly seems to overrule his impeccable technique. Krauss is Cantorâs scientific conscience or superego. If the experiment proves impossible to replicate, Krauss may accuse him of sloppiness, or even fabrication: âSurely he is not calling you a â. Paula stopped shortâ, p. 109). And once someoneâs credibility in science is damaged, it can never be repaired. The only option left to Cantor is to do the experiment himself, to become his own Servant as it were, and to design a second experimental test, climbing Everest by a different route (p. 116). Because he cannot trust Stafford anymore (p. 113), he has to take the experiment literally in his own hands, doffing his costume for a lab coat. It is only via working through that the methodological requirements and desire for recognition can be reconciled again. Various instances of self-reflection can be discerned on the epistemic level. In his Nobel speech, looking back on his experiences, Stafford suggests that the failure of the Harvard team to replicate the results was due to a procedural discrepancy that was âreally quite trivialâ, adding that âif there is one lesson to be learned from this experience, itâs that even the smallest details should be put in oneâs notebook â¦ You never know which details may turn out to be crucialâ (p. 198). This self-reflection not only concurs with the principles of experimental methodology, but also with the psychoanalytic rule that one should report any observations; that one should take care not to exclude any of them, for in principle nothing is irrelevantâ. Even seemingly trivial details (the bagatelle) may prove to be highly significant (Freud 1917/1940, p. 297). But in the novel, the role of the analyst, listening to the dialogues (the flow of university discourse) with evenly-poised attention, and from an oblique perspective, falls to Leah, the expert in Bachtinian analysis (p. 82). She is not at all interested in proteins, membranes or arginine, but rather in the grammar of biomolecular discourse.

390,580,0.209,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"The HL register pair is used to address memory. The first byte is read from memory into the accumulator with the MOV instruction, and then subsequent ADD instructions add the other 4 bytes to the accumulator. After each byte is read from memory, the value in the HL register pair is incremented with the INX instruction. Finally, the STA instruction stores the result in memory. How would this program be enhanced to add a hundred or a thousand bytes together? Would you just keep adding INX and ADD instructions to match the number of bytes you need to add? That doesnât seem quite right. Itâs not a solution that would work well with other needs. Itâs not a generalized solution. What might instead be handy is a new instruction that allows repeating certain sequences of instructions, in this case the INX and ADD instructions. But what would that look like? At first, such an instruction seems so different from existing instructions that you might fear it would require a complete overhaul of the CPU. But donât despair quite yet."

330,249,0.208,Dynamics of Long-Life Assets : From Technology Adaptation to Upgrading the Business Model,"Process development tools and upgrading methodologies include: â¢ The lean manufacturing philosophy in the pursuit of reducing wasteful activities and improving productivity and proï¬ts (Genaidy and Karwowski 2007). â¢ Lead time reduction by minimization of Manufacturing Critical-path Time in Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM, Suri 1998) and Demand Flow Factory (Pot and Van Rhijn 2012). â¢ Value Stream Mapping (VSM) or Business Process Modelling (BPM) tools to build a common perspective of a process workflow (e.g., Rother and Shook 2003). â¢ To allocate tasks at a process or workstation level, task or function allocation methodologies (e.g., Fasth and Stahre 2010; Challenger et al. 2013) are commonly used. In practice, these methods are mostly used independently by different company disciplines (i.e., departments) for improving product or process design. Development of products and processes in parallel and with strong interaction between different disciplines: sales, product design, process engineering, and operations (operators from manufacturing, assembly, maintenance) is essential for manufacturing but even more for maintenance, upgrading, and remanufacturing processes. Furthermore, parallelizing technology, product and development (as shown in Fig. 2), shortens time-to-market (ï¬rst time right) and can save a signiï¬cant amount of money (Quan and Jianmin 2006). To involve different disciplines in the product and process design phase, a participatory approach can be used. This participatory approach (e.g., Vink et al. 2008; Hirschheim 1989; Muller and Kuhn 1993) is a well-known and successful approach that could lead to quality improvements and a reduction in costs (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions 1999). It is a design procedure in which the relevant company stakeholders (e.g., management) and the end-users, i.e., the operators in a production process, engineers developing new products or maintenance personnel out in the ï¬eld, have the opportunity to influence the content of the design target (Bouckenooghe and Devos 2007; Lines 2004). If situations are complex, a stepwise and iterative approach could be adopted so that the anticipated effort and success could be reviewed. This interactive process, which is essential for gaining support and momentum to push innovation forward, improves communication, manages expectations and uses different perspectives and skills in the design process. The involvement of different disciplines and employees enables a potential resource for creativity and innovation (e.g., Shalley et al. 2004). Moreover, the involvement of employees from different disciplines is also essential because of the great deal of knowledge and experience they have about the products, production processes and problems that occur on a day-to-day basis. For instance, some or all of the workers who will work at a forthcoming plant could take part in a number of design sessions during different design stages (van Rhijn et al. 2014)."
17,21,0.208,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"education. Naturally, it needs to be recognised that âsocial justiceâ is an open concept, the meaning of which can be explored in many different directions. Addressing equity also represents concerns of critical mathematics education, and the discussion of social justice and equity bring us to address processes of inclusion and exclusion. Social exclusion can take the most brutal forms being based on violent discourses expressing racism, sexism, and hostility towards âforeignersâ or âimmigrantsâ. Such discourses might label groups of people as being âdisposableâ, âa burdenâ, or ânon-productiveâ, given the economic order of today. It is a concern of critical mathematics education to address any form of social exclusion (see, for instance, Martin 2009). However, social inclusion might also represent a questionable process: it could mean an inclusion into the capitalist mode of production and consumption. So, critical mathematics education needs to address inclusion-exclusion as contested processes. However, many forms of inclusion-exclusion have until now not been discussed profoundly in mathematics education: the conditions of blind students, deaf students, students with different disabilitiesâin other words: students with particular rights. However, such issues are now being addressed in the research environment created by the Lulu Healy and Miriam Goody Penteado in Brazil. Such initiatives bring new dimensions to critical mathematics education. Mathemacy is closely related to literacy, as formulated by Freire, being a competence in reading and writing the world. Thus, DâAmbrosio (1998) has presented a âNew Trivium for the Era of Technologyâ in terms of literacy, matheracy and technoracy. (DâAmbrosio talks about matheracy, while I prefer to use mathemacy.) Chronaki (2010) provides a multifaceted interpretation of mathemacy, and in this way it is emphasised that this concept needs to be re-worked, re-interpreted, and re-developed in a never-ending process. Different other notions have, however, been used as well for these complex competences, including mathematical literacy and mathematical agency. Jablonka (2003) provides a clarifying presentation of mathematical literacy, showing how this very notion plays a part in different discourses, including some that hardly represent critical mathematics education. The notion of mathematical agency helps to emphasise the importance of developing a capacity not only with respect to understanding and reflection but also with respect to acting. Dialogue. Not least due to the inspiration from Freire, the notion of dialogue has played an important role in the formulation of critical mathematics education. Dialogic teaching and learning has been presented as one way of developing broader critical competences related to mathematics (see AlrÃ¸ and Skovsmose 2002). Dialogic teaching and learning concerns forms of interaction in the classroom. It can be seen as an attempt to break at least some features of the logic of schooling and as a way of establishing conditions for developing mathemacy (or mathematical literacy, or mathematical agency). Problem-based learning and project work can also be seen as way of framing a dialogic teaching and learning. Pedagogical imagination. Critique in terms of imagination has been formulated in terms of sociological imagination. Through such imagination one reveals that something being the case could be different. I ï¬nd that a pedagogical imagination"

378,38,0.208,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"Not everyone within the transformation research community works with a transdisciplinary approach and reflexive paradigm. The community combines a wide array of scientiï¬c disciplines and is still sorting out where exactly paradigmatic agreements lie. So within this book I pulled together the work of leading scholars who do at least reject the positivist epistemology and ontology that one ï¬nds in the mainstream economic paradigm and its methodological individualism. In this paradigm, humans do not reflect on more than the costs and beneï¬ts of the choice set with which they are confronted. So each person in their economic system behaves similarly (representative actors), regardless of where they happen to live. This is very convenient because individual behavior assumptions are aggregated into extrapolations of how the system will work as a whole and what knock-on effects it will haveâe.g., the prediction that markets will balance themselves. However, even within allegedly objective, positivist/standard economics, it has been recognized that such additive approaches risk a fallacy of aggregation, ending in incorrect predictions. For example, American economist Alfred E. Kahn warned of The Tyranny of Small Decisions as early as 1966. He stressed that market equilibrium theory must remain cautious about the reliability of its methodological individualism: small decisions by rationally calculating actors may well lead to misallocation effects on the macro scale that produce outcomes which the same individuals would not choose (Kahn 1966: 23). One prime example of this tyrannical effect in natural sciences is the way that climate change results from the cumulative effect of what seem to be negligibly small entities of additional CO2 emissions made on the individual scale."

143,91,0.208,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Erik, there is a lot of controversy about government intervention into private-sector activities. What is your take? What should be the ideal role of government? So the role of the government is very simple: To reduce friction in the system for the technology industry to grow. What does that break down into? It breaks down into regulation that is actually good for businessâ speed of setting up business, tax breaks for new companies, things like that. Another example of friction in the system that does not need to exist is legacy laws that are 30 to 40 years old and put a 20 to 30 % duty on components imported into the country. I can import a fully assembled, packaged BRCK duty free. Yet the components to make it have a heavy import dutyâwhich means it does not make sense to import. In other words, I cannot create a new manufacturing industry in Kenya if we do not have the ability to bring in raw materials that are not produced in Kenya. Like this, we never will create industries unless we change these legacy laws. So again, governmentâs job is to reduce friction. And by reducing friction, they increase wealth and they increase jobs. Then there are other things, such as providing foundational access, of which the subsidization of the undersea cable by the government was a massive example. That is exactly what the government should be doing, massive projects that bring in both the public and private sectors and help things move further. Another one is regulation around spectrum allocation or licencing. How about foreign aid and NGOs? What should their role be? In a well-functioning state, most NGOs would not exist. There is only a limited role for them, because the market answers many of the problems, and the government should answer the rest. However, here in Kenya, we have one of the highest count of NGOs per capita in the world. It is an interesting dynamic though, because international NGOs bring in money for some things, which bastardizes the market for other things. It creates a whole realm of craziness that you would not find in other places. Let me give you an example. NGOs build bridges that after two years become dysfunctional.

85,26,0.207,Bayesian Methods in the Search for MH370,"The ACARS system also provides message communication between the aircraft and its ground base. At 18:03:23 Malaysian Airlines Operations Centre sent a message asking the crew to contact Vietnamese ATC immediately. The downlink message showed that this failed to reach the aircraft. The message was auto transmitted every two minutes until 18:43:33 with no success [35]. The next communication on the SATCOM system was a log-on request from the aircraft at 18:25. This communication contains no location information from the aircraft but it does however contain timing and frequency metadata which turn out to be crucial in estimating where MH370 went after the final radar return at 18:22:12. The timing measurement is called the Burst Timing Offset (BTO) and the frequency measurement the Burst Frequency Offset (BFO). At 18:39:52 there was an unanswered attempt to call the aircraft from ATC on the ground to air telephone link. The failed communication data log contains frequency but not timing metadata. If there has been no SATCOM activity for sixty minutes then the ground station automatically initiates a handshake confirming presence of the aircraft. If the aircraft receives this query then an automatic response is sent indicating that it is still logged on to the SATCOM network. These handshake responses contain both timing and frequency metadata. Handshake messages occurred at 19:41:00, 20:41:02, 21:41:24 and 22:41:19. At 23:15:58 there was a second unanswered attempt at a satellite telephone call, again giving frequency metadata. There was a ground station initiated handshake at 00:10:58 (timing and frequency metadata). Finally, at 00:19:29 the aircraft SATCOM system initiated another log-on request and this was the last SATCOM transmission received from the aircraft.

A state-of-the-art framework to assess the sustainability of power plants and their life cycle (nuclear in particular) is provided in [3]. Regarding environmental indicators in particular, the US EPA has focused on determining and developing the best impact assessment tool for Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), Pollution Prevention (P2), and Sustainability Metrics for the US. This research led to the creation of TRACIâthe Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts. The methodology has been developed speciï¬cally for the US using input parameters consistent with US locations. Site speciï¬city is available for many of the impact categories, but in all cases a US average value exists when the location is undetermined. The average values were implemented in the ecoinvent data. Further information is available at http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html. TRACI is therefore useful to compare different power plants and their life cycle. Unfortunately, these frameworks are hardly compressive for non-experts. In particular regarding the power sectors, people often have misconceptions that the tool envisaged by this research program will contribute to overcome. Some of the most relevant examples that we will address are:"
243,17,0.207,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"Strong expectations linked to eHealth are present in policy and advisory documents prepared around the globe. For instance, the introductory passage of a report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (US) states: âHealth and health care are going digital. As multiple intersecting platforms evolve to form a novel operational foundation for health and health care the stage is set for fundamental and unprecedented transformation.â (Institute of Medicine 2011). In Europe, eHealth has been a major component of the European Commissionâs eEurope action plan which was endorsed at the Feira European Council in June 2000. In 2004, the Commission also set in place an eHealth map to develop targeted policy initiatives aimed at fostering widespread adoption of eHealth technologies across the EU (eHealth Action Plan). The latest eHealth Action Plan for 2012â2020 states that the promise of eHealth âremains largely unfulfilledâ and the vision of a unified, interoperable eHealth Infrastructure in Europe is still not realised. Although the potential of eHealth is being discussed globally since the 1990s it remains a work in progress. Countries around Europe have already experienced notable successes and some highly publicised costly delays and failures. These have brought attention to the complexity of dealing with a multiplicity of involved parties with diverging interests and agendas, existing fragmented systemsâ landscape, rapid technological advancements and regulative perplexities. In most European countries, healthcare is predominantly public and public agencies have a central role for stimulating and orchestrating eHealth efforts. In many countries, the driving force for ICT in health care has been the trend toward a better coordination of care (Winter et al. 2011). This means a change of focus for eHealth from self-contained processes within single healthcare institutions to overall care processes spreading across institutional boundaries. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. In the next section we give an overview of the eHealth landscape. Then, in Sects. 2.3 and 2.4 we focus on the two types of infrastructures examined in this book: e-prescription and governmental patient-oriented platforms. Finally, Sect. 2.4 concludes the chapter with a discussion on the transformative potential of the two types of eHealth infrastructures."

His review was quite positive (!) and from that time we developed a long-lasting friendship. Later, both of us were associated with the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and together we supervised a few students, introduced new courses (e.g., puzzle-based learning), worked on several research grants, and wrote a few research papers. He, with his wife Ewa, visited us in the United States and stayed with us in our home; they also planned to visit us in Australia. Unfortunately, time had run out for him. It is my privilege to write the foreword for this book. First, I consider Witek one of the best friends I had in life. Second, his warm personality, sense of humor, and amazing intelligence made him a very special person in the lives and careers of so many people. Finally, the book covers many topics that were close to Witekâs heart âfuzzy sets, fuzzy systems, Ordered Fuzzy Numbersâto name a few. He also had a keen interest in applications of his research, and thus the third part of the book contains 11 application-oriented chapters. Witekâyouâll live in our memories forever. We miss you.

275,552,0.206,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"are written in Clojure syntax; the assumptions are written as maps from names to formulae. In the first simulation, we define what it means for an agent to be non-autonomous, namely that such an agent performs an action for achieving a goal if: (1) it is controlled by another agent; (2) believes that the controlling agent desires the goal; (3) believes that the action is necessary for the goal; and (4) it is requested to do so by its controlling agent. In this scenario, if the ideal observer can prove that the agent will perform the action for the goal based on the conditions above, the ideal observer can trust the agent. The second simulation is chiefly distinguished by one minor modification: The system does not know or believe that the agent a2 believes that the action requested from it is necessary for the goal. In this setting, the ideal observer cannot prove that the agent a2 will perform the required action. Hence, the ideal observer does not trust the agent. The third and final simulation mirrors TACU and its proof more closely. In Simulation 3, if the system cannot prove for any action that a1 believes a2 will perform"
171,80,0.206,Global Business Strategy : Multinational Corporations Venturing into Emerging Markets,"reduced the time and money spent on international meetings. The flattening of the world brought about by advances in telecommunication has enabled the management of local entities using a headquarter-led global integration model. On the other hand, many global companies have overseas revenues that exceed domestic revenues, making local autonomy in operating a business critical. In addition, the primary battlegrounds for global businesses are shifting from developed to developing nations. The circumstances faced by local entities are often different from those faced by headquarters, making it reasonable to give more weight to local responsiveness. Furthermore, giving decision-making authority to local entities and improving local employee morale is critical to utilizing excellent local personnel. Balancing uniform company-wide activities and local entity autonomy requires a seamless organizational operation at a global level by doing away with company borders. For example, Panasonic has standardized internal rankings for management posts in domestic and overseas operations, and promotes local personnel to increase the fluidity of management at the global level. Many companies in the US and Europe have achieved a flat world environment with no apparent borders, operating as trans-national organizations. Japanese companies are working toward the creation of organizational structures that balance headquartersâ control and local entity responsiveness."
165,180,0.206,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"As a result, the prevailing understanding of segregation measurement rests on a widely shared but incorrect assumption that high scores on popular segregation indices always signal the condition of prototypical segregation involving concentrated displacement and group residential separation. This is not the case. In particular, high values of the dissimilarity index (D), the most widely used segregation index, do not and intrinsically cannot provide a reliable signal about the presence of prototypical segregation.3 In contrast, high values of the separation index (S) provide a certain indication that a high level of prototypical segregation is present. The outcome of high displacement but with low separation â that is, high D and low S â occurs when residential distributions are characterized by âdispersed displacement.â In the pattern of dispersed displacement, individuals residing in nonparity areas are not concentrated in areas where their group predominates. Instead, the residential distribution for at least one of the groups â usually the smaller of the two groups, which in White-Minority comparisons in US cities is typically, but not always, the non-White minority group â is dispersed widely and thinly across nonparity areas such that most members of the group live in âmixedâ areas where their group is not the predominant presence. Indeed, it can be the case that few members of the group live in areas where their group is a majority presence and instead most members of the group live in areas where the other group in the comparison is the predominant group. As a result, under dispersed displacement the two groups in the comparison live together in areas with similar racial composition, not apart from each other in areas where racial composition is polarized."

Study sites that did not intersect with either degraded or improved pixels of the Le et al. (2014) dataset were considered to have mixed results.

Consequently, the only tool for proceeding towards a formal revision of the constitutional text was to recur to the constituent power. This solution found a reference in the words of King Charles Albert who on the occasion of the opening of the second legislature made explicit reference to a constituent assembly which had the revision of the constitutional text as a duty.46 The discourse of the sovereign was pronounced on 1 February 1849 in a very particular moment of the national history: the ï¬ve days of Milan were just over, there had been the armistice of Salasco and the resurgence of the conflicts with Austria, while Venice resisted siege and in Rome the republic had been proclaimed. The Lombardy-Venetian people were going to hold universal-suffrage elections and they had voted for joining the Kingdom of Piedmont forcing the latter to convene a national assembly which had to proceed to revising the Statute.47 Giuseppe Mazzini, moved to Milan in order to give his support to the patriots, sent a note to the Lombardy provisional Government highlighting his"

193,58,0.205,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"(ties to people and institutions that facilitate finding jobs and housing abroad) to diversify risk and maximize utility. Similar conclusions can be drawn from a study of Ukrainian teachers working abroad in low-skilled jobs, according to which the most popular reasons for choosing a particular destination country were âhaving relatives/friends abroadâ and âbetter employment and/or income opportunities compared to other countriesâ, followed by âknowledge of language of that countryâ and âgeographical/cultural proximity of the country to Ukraineâ (Kupets 2013). At the same time, quite important reasons also reported by over 20% of respondents were the relative ease of gaining visas, work/residence permits and irregular entry to the country of current destination. A growing number of policy studies on Ukraineâs path toward a visa-free regime with the EU2 suggest that visa issues are quite important for the choice of destination country, the economic performance of Ukrainians abroad and the consequences of the migration experience for both sending and receiving countries. In one sociological survey3 that only partially supports this statement, an absolute majority of Ukrainian respondents did not consider the visa regime with Europe to be a significant barrier to their emigration or labour migration, and reported their lack of financial means to be the major obstacle (Kipen and Avksentiev 2011). An interesting study by Weinar et al. (2012) that looks at the Schengen visa regime as a tool of labour migration policy and assesses the potential impact of liberalization of the visa regime on migratory movements between Ukraine and Moldova and the EU finds that the current Schengen visa regime has not been particularly successful in protecting labour markets in the destination countries from the flow of immigrant workers from Ukraine and Moldova. Szulecka (Chap. 4) discusses the impact of visa regimes on Ukrainian migrants in detail. Such a regime restricts the development prospects of the countries of origin by limiting circular migration, intellectual capital circulation and business exchanges. Fedyuk (Chap. 5) provides a critical analysis of the so-called social costs of Ukrainian labour migration."

The newly independent Uganda Government was accountable to its citizens in ways that the colonial government never had been, and psychiatrists were well aware of the need to demonstrate the relevance of their work. In this, many of Ugandaâs psychiatrists benefitted from their association with Makerere Medical School, which during the 1960s became an internationally renowned centre of research and practice, attracting over Â£280,000 in medical research grants between 1964â1967 (approximately 5 million pounds in todayâs terms).18 Yet psychiatry nevertheless faced ongoing practical constraints on its ability to translate rhetoric and small-scale experiments into real, felt change âon the groundâ. Much of this was beyond the control of the psychiatrists. Indeed, it proved impossible, logistically and financially, to train sufficient specialist personnel in such a short period of time. Similarly, the scale of the task of moving psychiatry away from a system that continued to bring only the most âurgentâ or violent patients to the gates of Butabika Hospital was overwhelming. But equally, the limits to reform might be best understood as a failure to fully consider the needs and priorities of the patients themselves."

337,99,0.204,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"On the French Caribbean island of Martinique in late April 1902, La Commission Sur le Volcan (Commission on the Volcano) met to decide a course of action. The islandâs Mt. PelÃ©e was sending steam and smoke skyward, the smell of sulfur was in the air, and swarms of insects were moving down the mountain into neighboring cane fields. Frequent earthquakes and a thin layer of ash had set the population (particularly in the coastal city of St. Pierre) on edge and created a sense of crisis. The Commission included doctors, pharmacists, and science teachers, all appointed by the Governor. They discussed the potential of an eruption and what precautions, including evacuation, should be considered. The island was in the midst of general elections, complicating a response. After several meetings, the Commission made its decision, and announced âThere is nothing in the activity of PelÃ©e that warrants a departure from St. Pierreâ¦the safety of St. Pierre [is] absolutely assured.â Posters were placed throughout the town announcing the publicâs safety. On May 8 Mt. PelÃ©e erupted with an incandescent, high-velocity ash flow, associated hot gases, and dust â a pyroclastic flow of great destructive power. The cloud of hot ash and gases raced into St. Pierre at an estimated speed of 160 km/h (Fig. 3.1). Approximately 30,000 residents (including all members of the Commission) died within minutes, leaving only two survivors. One eyewitness described the scene: The whole side of the mountain seemed to gape open, and from the fissure belched a lurid whirlwind of fire, which wreathed itself into vast masses of flame as, with terrible speed, it"

How do firms finance themselves in the short and long term? How diffuse are different forms of credit? 2. Regarding the characteristics of financially constrained firms: Which firms are more likely to be financially constrained? To address this issue, we focus on the differences across several characteristics at the firm levelâproductivity, size, age, ownership structure, gender of the owner, location, and financial structure. 3. Regarding the role of external factors: Do differences in macroeconomic, financial, and institutional variables (income levels, presence of credit registries, financial development, presence of foreign banks, market competition) across countries help explain the variability in access to finance? In the next section, we review the literature on credit market structure and financing constraints on firms. Then we describe the main characteristics of the banking systems in the region and provide an overview of the financing structure. Then we look at firmsâ access to bank financing in LAC. We examine firm-specific characteristics and country-specific credit market features associated with financing constraints. Finally, we provide some conclusions."

Subsequently, two industrial ADD operators â 7 Ã 4 Pharma and AvidiaMed3 â have set-up production sites and run trials. The blistering facilities of 7 Ã 4 Pharma had been designed to produce weekly blister packs for polypharmacy patients at a national scale, i.e. up to 100.000 patient specific blisters per day. In parallel a number of blister centers have been set-up by pharmacies at a regional level, which produce blisters for a small number of participating pharmacies. Moreover, a number of pharmacies offer the (manual) production of dose administration aids as an additional, usually complimentary service. While there are numerous options of how to design ADD, 7 Ã 4 Pharma had opted for key design features for their pilot: They used blisters instead of sachets, in order to increase the quality of the medication packs. 7 Ã 4 Pharma covers a dispensing range or assortment of 400 standard, generic and proprietary substances (Kohl 2010, p. 10). 7 Ã 4 Pharma operated as a service provider for pharmacies, in collaboration with general practitioners and specialist doctors instead of direct deliveries to care homes and home care patients. They designed a process flow (Fig. 10.1), which illustrates the direct collaboration with doctors, pharmacists and wholesalers and the indirect involvement of patients and insurance providers. Three components of medication management, specifically medication information management are crucial for the operation of ADD: â¢ Electronic information exchange akin with electronic prescription between ADD operator, physician and pharmacy. ADD assumes up to date comprehensive information about all of patientâs prescriptions in order to be able to provide a comprehensive blister of all oral medicines. â¢ Based on the prescriptions, a consolidated and comprehensive patient medication plan is created. â¢ A medication list, typically based on active ingredients identifies standard medication and possible substitutes. The medication list can help to deal with the complexity and multiplicity of medicines. As 7 Ã 4 Pharma was the first, most prominent and indeed most controversial attempt to establish ADD in Germany, we have focussed on their case."

One newspaper article got close to recommending Lex Talionis in 1770. âThe late horrid frequency of murders would tempt one to wish for a revival of the ancient Lex Talionisâ, it suggested, âlet him who shoots another be shot; who strangles his fellow creature be strangledâ,91 and a year earlier Blackstone mentioned in passing the lack of âan exemplary punishmentâ for parricide92âan issue that was also debated in the run up to the 1752 Act. In the mid-1780s William Paley, in searching for a way to âaugment the horror of punishment without offending â¦ public sensibilityâ mentioned a recent proposal which involved privately âcasting murderers into a den of wild beastsâ.93 In general, however, the other forms of aggravated executionâbreaking on the wheel, gibbeting alive or burning alive and so forthâthat were quite frequently advocated before 1752 (Chap. 2) found no place in these later debates. In 1762 the Tyburn crowd did create its own brief form of post-execution punishment by stoning the bodies of two women who had just been executed for murdering their apprentice, whilst they were still hanging on the gallows.94 However, the only major post-execution sanction proposed in these years centred on the method of burying the offenderâs corpse. In 1775 Hanway advocated the burial of the hanged in a special, well-marked and âstrongly walled in â¦ malefactors burial placeâ by âa road near the entrance to a city, such as Tyburnâ, which he believed âcould not fail of making some impressionâ on the minds of likely offenders.95 Ten years later The Times despite pointing out that âcriminal executions should be as much avoided as possibleâ, went on to suggest that in âparticular atrocious casesâ it would create âa greater terrorâ if the offender was 'hanged in secret and then thrown immediately into a private hole dug for them in a part of the prison â¦ and quicklime thrown over the dead bodyâ.96 In the third quarter of the eighteenth century two other death penalty-related punishments were also discussed, both of which involved subjecting capital convicts to the danger of dying whilst still offering the possibility, or even the probability, of survival. One of these, suggested by a Norwich correspondent of the Gentlemanâs Magazine, involved a bizarre form of half-hanging, which all felons apart from murderers would be eligible for. âThe convict should be hangedâ, the article suggested, âbut instead of being suspended for an hour let it be only for one minute, or less, in which time he will be as dead to his own sense of feeling, and as much punished, as if he were kept hanging the usual time â¦ Would not a man thus brought again on the stage of life become â¦ a more useful member of society?â97"

299,65,0.202,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"utilitarian perspectiveâ that âmeasures of perceived certainty of punishment must be from the viewpoint of the respondent.â In order to account for the fact that the same punishment may have a different impact on different people, they also asked âhow big a problem that punishment would create for your life.â Finally, in an effort to measure moral commitment the authors asked respondents to rank a series of criminal acts in order of how wrong they considered them to be (never, seldom, sometimes, usually, and always). All three independent variables correlated significantly. Moreover, moral commitment was correlated more strongly with reported past and estimated future criminal acts (â0.42 and â0.55, respectively) than were the perceived certainty of arrest (â0.34 and â0.24, respectively) or the perceived severity of punishment (â0.27 and â0.30, respectively). That is, both deterrence and moral commitments discouraged illegal acts. This finding supports highlights the importance of morality, in addition to material incentives and coercion, for a functioning society and economy (see Drakulich and Crutchfeild 2013; Arrow 2006; Phelps 1975, p. 5). Along the same lines, the literature on tax compliance has found that peopleâs decision to pay (or evade) their taxes has as much to do with their moral obligation as a citizen as with the fear of punishment. However, this economic model in fact âgreatly overpredicts noncomplianceââjust as a purely egoistic individual would lie, cheat, and steal, he would also evade his taxes. Instead, studies of tax compliance found that âincorporating noneconomic motivations, such as a moral preference for honest reporting, does reduce predicted noncomplianceâ to more realistic levels (Andreoni et al. 1998). In particular, peopleâs âpersonal norms,â including âaltruistic orientation,â community values, cooperation, honesty, and religious beliefs, as well as their âsocial norms,â the attitude of oneâs âprofessional groups, friends and acquaintancesâ toward tax evasion, all have a significant influence on tax compliance. Likewise, the âperceived fairness of taxation,â including the both the âperceived balance of taxes paid and public goods receivedâ and the âperceived justiceâ the enforcement regime, is strongly related to tax compliance (Hofmann et al. 2008). Research has also found that âsocial interventionsâ based on âleveraging social concernsâ can be more effective than material incentives in encouraging cooperative behavior. In trying to encourage water conservation in drought-affected California, the traditional economics-based approach of raising water prices did little to discourage water use. On the other hand, the simple act of emailing homeowners a comparison of their water use to that of their neighbors was as effective as a 10% price increase (Yoeli et al. 2015). This case, however, shows the continuing prevalence of reductionist assumptions."
107,296,0.202,"Symbiotic interaction : 5Th international Workshop, Symbiotic 2016, Padua, Italy, September 29â30, 2016, Revised Selected Papers","Comprehensive recording of oneâs personal media and communication has been a long-lasting aspiration. Already in 1945, Vannevar Bush had a vision of a mechanised device, Memex, that would store all read books, records, and communications, and enable quick consultation of the recorded material [4]. There have been several projects attempting to fulfill the Memex vision. In MyLifeBits [12], the goal is to digitise all personal and professional information, an activity nowadays commonly referred to as lifelogging [14]. Stuff Iâve Seen [9] focuses on re-using the recorded information using a single index for all pieces of information (emails, web pages, documents, calendar entries etc.) on the userâs computer. Two main approaches have been proposed to enable human-centric control of personal data. The first approach is to centralise the storage of the data itself. With this approach, the scattering of data is solved by providing individuals with a personal data storage service within which they accumulate data from various sources. The personal data storage system OpenPDS [8] is one such initiative. It is focused on the aggregation and storage of specifically logtype, large-scale behavioural metadata, such as locations or web searches, and it aims to provide its users with the possibility to give fine-grained access to such metadata. Rather than provisioning access to the raw data as such, OpenPDS includes a questions-and-answers feature intended to allow services to ask questions that are responded to based on metadata. Another example of this approach is the digital.me1 EU project, which focuses in particular on collecting data from social web services. Also commercial developers provide personal data storage services. Digi.me2 and Meeco3 are proprietary personal data repositories, whose aim and approach is to become a marketplace for personal data, via which their users would be able to supply personal data to usages they deem beneficial. Cozy Cloud4 is an open source personal cloud service, whose approach is to bring the services and analytics to the cloud with the aid of an application platform within the cloud service. Its model closely resembles a personal information management system (PIMS) as described in [1]. Another important PDS project is the Hub-of-All things5 , which is especially focused on Internet of Things applications. The second approach to enabling the control of personal data is to focus not on containing personal data in a centralised storage, but rather on managing the flows of data between data sources and data-users. In this case, the scattering of data with disparate third parties is solved by federation of data sources [18]. The individual controls the uses of personal data by employing tools and infrastructure intended for managing permissions to access data. This is the rationale of the MyData model [21], which also has a reference architecture [10] that describes"

Self-optimising systems with their ability to analyse data, to model processes and to take decisions offer an approach to master processes without explicit control functions. After a brief introduction, two approaches of self-optimising strategies are presented. The ï¬rst example demonstrates the autonomous generation of technology models for a milling operation. Process knowledge is a key factor in manufacturing and is also an integral part of the self-optimisation approach. In this context, process knowledge in a machine readable format is required in order to provide the self-optimising manufacturing systems a basis for decision making and optimisation strategies. The second example shows a model based self-optimised injection moulding manufacturing system. To compensate process fluctuations and guarantee a constant part quality the manufactured products, the self-optimising approach uses a model, which describes the pvT-behaviour and controls the injection process by a determination of the process optimised trajectory of temperature and pressure in the mould."

255,440,0.202,Railway Ecology,"Vegetation of railway verges in France The studies described in this chapter were conducted along railway verges. Railway verges are all the green areas that are beside the railway tracks. The total area occupied by railway verges in France is estimated by the railway owner, the SNCF RÃ©seau company, at 50 000 hectares. The vegetation type on these green spaces is dictated by security reasons. Management is thus necessary but different in different parts of the railway concerned: â Tracks and lanes: the goal is the absence of vegetation to avoid platform/ infrastructure deterioration. Total weed control is recommended once a year but depends on the age of the infrastructure. For instance, a recent track, better drained, is less sensitive to plant colonization and is usually not treated for 10 year; The verges can be separated in two main zones: â The ï¬rst zone is adjacent to the tracks and has variable width depending on the slope and surrounding landscape. Here the objective is to have an herbaceous vegetation to allow visibility and limit ï¬re problems. These semi-natural grasslands are ideally managed by annual or multi-annual mowing depending on ï¬re risks and on potential recolonisation by woody species; â In the second zone, the desired vegetation can be higher depending on their conï¬guration: if the verge is lower compared to the tracks (ï¬ll section), the trees and shrubs are allowed to grow higher compared to a conï¬guration where the verges are higher than the tracks (cut section). Management here does not need to be intensive and can be done every 3â5 years depending on the slope and the vegetation in the surrounding landscape. We examined two types of railways: recently built high-speed railway lines (1994 and 2007) and long-established railway lines (built in the nineteenth century). In the high-speed lines, we studied verges from 10 to 20 m-wide, composed of herbaceous species and shrubs. No vegetation management plan existed for these verges. Clearcutting of trees and mowing were applied on a case-by-case basis when presenting threats for train security, e.g. risk of tree falling on overhead lines. The long-established lines traverse a landscape structured by different degrees of urbanisation, as they cross numerous cities and towns from the centre of Paris towards the limits of the region. The vegetation found along the borders of the train tracks is mainly spontaneous as the verges have not been planted or sown since their construction and is principally interrupted by railway stations and overpasses."

226,96,0.202,Formalizing The Shadow Economy in Serbia : Policy Measures and Growth Effects,"this programme will certainly be the need to reduce the moral hazard risk involved in distributing the limited funds available in the budget. Alternatively, Serbia could gradually shift to the globally accepted practice of establishing institutions providing micro-finance to entrepreneurs and SMEs that find traditional borrowing either inaccessible or too costly. Originally envisaged as non-profit entities owned by the very people most at risk and in need of financing to start their businesses, these institutions can take the form of either co-operatives or credit unions. They can also formally be incorporated as non-governmental organisations or savings banks, or can even be owned by the government as sectororiented banks (e.g., agricultural development banks, rural banks, etc.). The key issue and precondition for establishing these specialised entities essentially remains similar to that for the proposal to establish a single Serbian Development Bank: it is necessary to design appropriate laws and bylaws to prevent corruption in allocating funds, and ensure professionalism and efficiency in managing the limited resources available to such an entity. As shown by the survey of businesses and entrepreneurs in Serbia, one of the major constraints on doing business is access to formal financing, as well as weak purchasing power, frequent changes to legislation, high tax rates, inflation, and political instability. Most business entities are financed from net profits (92 %), while slightly more than one-quarter borrow from banks (24 %). Business entities tend to borrow either from banks or from their owners, while entrepreneurs rely on funds borrowed from individuals, friends, or family members. Another initiative of the Ministry of Finance and Economy current in 2013, which should facilitate access to liquid financing, is a programme of subsidised liquidity loans, which will be aimed at SMEs. Slightly more than half of all business entities surveyed believe that financing in their sector of activity came in part from informal sources on which no tax is paid; the estimated share of informal investment was up to 50 % of the total investment. On the other hand, such financing was rarely admitted when respondents spoke about their own operations. Only one-fifth of all business entities stated that investment in their companies came in part from informal financing (with up to 30 % of the sum total of investments), while 66 % claimed that no such financing was invested in their company."

211,6,0.201,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"How do people think? By understanding how people think, we can do a better job of explaining their actions. Both of us (the authors) were drawn to this topic in the extreme context of entrepreneurship. This context is extreme because the actions associated with entrepreneurship can have a substantial impact on the individual taking the actions, the economy, communities, the environment, and society as a whole. For example, to explain why one individual creates a venture to benefit the community (Shepherd and Williams 2014) whereas another individual creates a venture that harms the natural environment for personal gain (Shepherd et al. 2013), we need to understand peopleâs cognitionsâwhat happens in their minds. Not only are the outcomes of entrepreneurial actions extreme (in their impact), but the associated decision making is also extremeâextreme in uncertainty, complexity, time pressure, emotionality, and identity investment. We felt that investigating cognition under such extreme conditions afforded us the opportunity to workâand push forwardâthe knowledge frontier. That is, we were able to take the existing body of knowledge (from relevant literatures on cognitive science, decision making, and other aspects of psychology) and adapt it, twist it, and blend it to make a new form that would explain entrepreneurial cognition. For example, how do people make decisions in highly uncertain environmentsâthat is, when one does not know the odds of different alternative outcomes occurring (i.e., risk), nor does one even know the possible alternative outcomes"

277,363,0.201,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"11.6.2 Knowledge Production: State of Research and General Data on Education Migrant children and young people with a migration background and their integration processes in the educational system have been topics of research for more than 30 years. Until the new millennium, however, relatively few representative data existed on the situation and educational success of migrant children in Germany. It was PISA in particular that raised public and political awareness about the poor performance of and disadvantages facing children with a migration background in the German school system (Baumert et al. 2006, 397). But PISA also stimulated research activities within the education research community, among them sociologists, pedagogues and linguists, and a wide variety of books and articles analysing the role of migrant children and the school system in general have been published since then (e.g. Kristen 2002, 2006; Diefenbach 2010; Stanat 2006; Stanat and Christensen 2006; Esser 2006; Baumert et al. 2006; Gomolla and Radtke 2002; Auernheimer 2010; Matzner 2012). The scientific and public discussion that emerged revolved around dependence of school performance on social status, institutional discrimination, school structures, language acquisition, early childhood education, and the comparison of educational achievements between certain ethnic groups. As a result of PISA, several governmental institutions commissioned research of their own. On behalf of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the LÃ¤nder in the Federal Republic of Germany (KMK) the most prominent example is the âBildungsberichtâ (education report). The report is published every 2-years by a consortium of research institutions. The first report in 2006 had a particular focus on the situation of children with a migration background. Another publication that recently has been introduced is the annual âBildungsmonitorâ (Education Monitor),15 published by the Initiative for a New Social Market Economy (INSM). This organisation is closely linked to employers, and therefore also rather focused on the economic benefits of an improved education system, including better educational achievements of young adults from migrant families."

158,266,0.2,Microfinance 3.0 : Reconciling Sustainability With Social Outreach and Responsible Delivery,"The greenfield approach pursued by DFIs in cooperation with strong technical partners over the past decade has been straightforward in terms of ownership. The key element and a major success factor of this approach has been the gathering of strategic and like-minded shareholders with common objectives, primarily DFIs15 and lately also private socially responsible investors. This club of DFI shareholders has enacted a highly effective governance structure, initially through direct shareholding and board membership in the early greenfield operations and today largely in an indirect manner via the respective holding company. The DFIs have been the pioneers in microfinance equity investments, and through this ownership participation have had a key role in promoting good corporate governance through active engagement. Even today, DFIs are still the largest equity investors with US$2.3 billion in microfinance equity in 2011 (CGAP 2012). However, in the rapidly changing funding landscape MIVs have grown to become the second most important source of equity capital with almost US$ one billion in 2011 (Symbiotics 2012). 4.4 Role and Responsibilities of the Board A key element of good governance is the functional separation of board and management. The guiding concept is a two-tier system of accountability where a supervisory body holds an executive body accountable for performance. The challenges are (i) to structure an effective board in terms of size, composition, qualification, responsibilities, compensation, adoption of a conflict of interest policy, and with the right balance of governance and management, and (ii) to structure effective board processes including the preparation and conduct of meetings, decisionmaking etc. The reality on the ground is still far from this ideal and many MFIs have a long way to go in order to achieve those standards. Governance by the board is particularly weak in NGO-MFIs in several respects. Firstly, accountability of board members is structurally weak due to the absence of clear ownership. Secondly, board members are often volunteers with social background and little know how in finance. Thirdly, management capture is the greatest vulnerability in MFIs with weak board governance. It happens often that a charismatic CEO or general manager dominates the board, thus weakening the boardâs oversight of the MFI and the board merely serving as a rubber stamp for the management. The opposite may also be the case where the board dominates governance, especially where charismatic founders are in the chair position. Such board may try to manage and not govern. Especially, when the management is perceived as weak the board may engage in operational issues â become a hands-on board as the other extreme to the rubber-stamp board (Rock 1998) â and hence depart from its govern15"
133,344,0.2,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Conceptual Framework Different mechanisms have been proposed for the link between family status and health behaviour. In the ï¬rst, partnership and parenting positively influence health behaviour through social control and through social support (Brockmann and Klein 2004; Umberson 1987, 1992; Umberson et al. 2010). Social control in particular seems to be an important determinant of health behaviour, affecting health behaviours directly (e.g., sanctions for deviant behaviour, regulation, and physical intervention) and indirectly (e.g., internalisation of norms of healthful behaviour and facilitation of positive health behaviours) (Umberson 1987). There may also be mechanisms by which having a partner and living with children could lead to a decrease in healthy behaviour (e.g., stress caused by combined social roles, social and domestic responsibilities, increased demands on time, or discord in the relationship) (Brown et al. 2009; Eng et al. 2005; Hull et al. 2010; Nomaguchi and Bianchi 2004). A transition to divorce or widowhood could also be detrimental to health because of the loss of social control or social support provided by a partner. Furthermore, it is also noted that many associations are reciprocal (e.g., a stressful relationship may lead to heavy drinking that, in turn, further stresses the relationship). Another explanation for the link between partnership and health behaviour is that the search for a partner is associated with speciï¬c health behaviours. The need to be attractive and to go to places where potential partners might be found may result in behaviours such as increased physical activity, dieting, higher alcohol consumption, and smoking (Rapp and Schneider 2014). One interesting ï¬nding emerging from the research on family status and health behaviour is that the effects of marriage and parenting are different for men and women. Women are more likely to attempt to control the health behaviours of other family members than are men (Fuller 2010). Consequently, marriage is more likely to be associated with social control for men. Additionally, men engage in health-risk behaviours more often, and this may be a focus of social control in marriage (Umberson 1987). Interestingly, women more often report experiencing social control by a parent or a child (Fuller 2010)âit may be that for women, the experience of marriage as a source of social control is relatively diminished in the context of other agents of social control. A ï¬nal consideration is the socio-economic situation of women and men, which varies depending on living arrangements. Socio-economic status (SES) could be a mediator in the association of partnership and parenthood with health behaviour. For example, single parents often have a lower SES than do partnered parents, and this may contribute to a higher prevalence of health-risk behaviour. It cannot be assumed, however, that the relationships between partnership and parenthood and health behaviour can be explained entirely by socio-economic and occupational factors (Roos et al. 1998). In the same vein, SES could be a moderator, as SES and family status may interact and show cumulative adverse effects on health behaviour."
18,65,0.2,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"On March 11 of 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami affected the Tohoku District of Japan. In TEPCOâs Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, the external power supply was lost because of damage to the grid lines caused by the earthquake, and emergency diesel generators were terminated by the tsunami, which eliminated the capability to control radioactivity in reactors and the spent fuel storage pool. Consequently, a large amount of radioactive materials was released into the environment. Immediately after the release there was tremendous difficulty in managing the radioactive materials. It was extremely difficult to maintain communication, to mobilize human resources, and to procure supplies among other areas when addressing the nuclear accident that coincided with a massive natural disaster. Then, environmental radiation monitoring was initiated and various kinds of protective measures were implemented; however, radiation exposure resulted among the residents of Fukushima Prefecture and neighboring areas. Radiation exposure was initially caused by radioisotopes of iodine and short-lived radionuclides and subsequently by radiocesium from both external irradiation and internal irradiation through consumption of foods contaminated with these radionuclides. Data and information related to dose assessment, such as in air dose rate and the concentration of radioactive materials in various environmental media after the Fukushima accident, have been reported by various organizations and disclosed by news media and the Internet. The International Symposium held on 14 December 2012 by Kyoto University provided an excellent opportunity for the integration of relevant information. Results of dose assessment for various populations have been also reported by various authors. However, no quantified and conclusive results of dose assessment have been reported by the responsible organization so far. The results are still in the process of being finalized for official presentation to the public. In the present comments, therefore, I start by describing the implication of dose assessment in general, then I will report some results of dose assessment in the Fukushima accident. Finally, I touch on a key point of the present accident, radiation exposure of children, which seems to me extremely important for current radiation protection."

In contrast to for-profit markets, where profit is made through product sales, nonprofit markets give grants to start-ups so that they target beneficiaries, that is, those at the bottom of the pyramid who cannot otherwise afford to pay for the companyâs product or service. As one technology entrepreneur explained: [For grants] you need to hit as many poor people in the slums as possible. That might be different from what angel [investors] say.

The log-on messages at 18:25 and 00:19 contain BFO measurements but the equipment was not in steady state. The values of the BFO measurements were deemed to be unreliable at these times and cannot be used. The key pieces of information available to us to estimate the MH370 flight path are the final radar detection at 18:22:12 and the timing and frequency metadata associated with the infrequent SATCOM messaging that subsequently occurred up until 00:19. Table 2.1 summarises the available measurement data. The messages at 18:25 and 00:19 occurred during transient phases of operation for the SATCOM equipment so the BFO values reported for these times cannot be used. In the next two chapters we describe the Bayesian approach, and then how the satellite communication system works and how the timing and frequency metadata can be related to aircraft location, allowing us to build a likelihood function for our Bayesian analysis.

Conversely, modern children spend most of their time in artiï¬cially controlled environments (ACE; indoors), interacting with screen-based computer devices (SBCDs), stimulating mostly the visual and audiâ tory senses and instilling sedentary behavior [27, 36]. The Digital Age was accompanied by a strong decline in physical activity (PA) in modern children. This decline sparked multiple physical and mental health issues [25]. Furthermore, it seems that whole-body interaction [30] in natural environments [13] still beneï¬ts childrenâs cognitive function (e.g., conceptual knowledge, attention and memory functions) compared to sedentary interaction indoors. The following section describes the physical and mental health issues linked to the use of SBCDs in ACE and real-world settings (including why cognitive development/performâ ance are not being optimized). Our approach is described in Sect. 2 - a solution based on the employment of Biosymtic devices. Conclusions are then presented in Sect. 3. Â© The Author(s) 2017 L. Gamberini et al.

171,294,0.199,Global Business Strategy : Multinational Corporations Venturing into Emerging Markets,"â¢ Policy-driven (responses to local regulations, R&D incentives, and participation in local standardization activities) â¢ Production-driven (technical support for local production facilities) â¢ Cost-driven (utilization of cheap local personnel) â¢ Innovation-driven (acquisition of local ideas for new products, strengthening of global product development structures through optimal division of labor) The countries and regions that are targets for overseas R&D need to be considered in conjunction with the above R&D activities, alongside institutional factors such as preferential policies for foreign R&D firms or intellectual property frameworks of the country and economic factors such as the level of local R&D personnel and costs. Furthermore, we introduced the concept of reverse innovation, in which innovations from emerging nations are rolled out to global markets. Because of the vastly different business environments between emerging nations and a global companyâs home nation, global companies often cannot respond by just improving products originally made for the home nation for local markets. In these cases, it is necessary to develop products with a completely new mindset using a team focused on the unique qualities of the local subsidiary. Commitments from the top management for these projects, and resources and organizations to bridge the gap between both countries are necessary to incorporate local innovations into corporate-wide activities. Finally, we must comment on topics not raised in this chapter with regard to R&D internationalization. First, we need to address the question of how reporting lines in overseas facilities should be structured. As shown in this chapter, it is easier to discuss âresearchâ and âdevelopmentâ separately. âResearchâ in overseas facilities is often a part of home countryâs corporate research groups or R&D centers, whereas âdevelopmentâ is often performed within the division of each product line. However, there are recent movements to strengthen the connections between âresearchâ and âdevelopment.â For example, many divisions outsource certain projects to corporate research groups, and researchers that conducted basic research in the firmâs research center are transplanted to development groups to manage projects for specific products and services. In these cases, the reporting lines of research centers and operating divisions in overseas research organizations can become entangled, creating the risk of decreased efficiency. In these instances, companies must consider on a project-by-project basis whether the technology or region axis is more important and structure reporting accordingly. For example, for projects that have a common technology platform, it is effective to work under the home countryâs research group; for projects that involve regional business development, it is effective to work under the regional headquarter. Of course, both sides must share information, but matrix organizations with multiple reporting lines often do not work well. In addition, as a practical matter for overseas R&D management, the management of technical information is important. The importance of this issue differs greatly between research and development groups. Research groups often conduct"

There are two different ways of doing the analysis properly in R: ANOVA with multiple error terms (aov) or linear mixed-effects models (lmer). The problem is that the bits of the same liver are pseudoreplicates because they are spatially correlated (they come from the same rat); they are not independent, as required if they are to be true replicates. Likewise, the two preparations from each liver bit are very highly correlated (the livers were macerated before the preparations were taken, so they are essentially the same sample (certainly not independent replicates of the experimental treatments). Here is the correct analysis using aov with multiple error terms. In the Error term we start with the largest scale (treatment), then rats within treatments, then liver bits within rats within treatments.

14,149,0.198,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"Growing up NorwegianâState, Class and Childhood: the Hegemonic Childhood Regime In the Norwegian welfare discourse, the future sustainability of the welfare state is increasingly regarded as dependant on the well-being of the family and the cognitive and emotional capacity of children (Esping-Andersen 2002). Childrenâs lives have changed rather drastically the last ï¬fty years due to several factors including a strong increase in familiesâ purchasing power, intended political changes in gender relations, and the last thirty yearsâ influx of immigrants from all parts of the world. Scholars have described Norwegian childhood as increasingly modelled on middle class life courses and norms (Stefansen 2011; Gullestad 1996; Leira 2004). Norwegian childhood is managed through institutions such as primary health care, kindergartens, schools, sports clubs, parent education, TV programmes, and housing politics among others. These institutions beneï¬t the middle class and are supported by middle class values and ambitions. Social researchers see childrenâs role in the family now foremost as emotional, conï¬rming the intimacy of family bonds (Aries 1996; Gullestad 1996; Stefansen 2011). Gender equality politics advocate both parents as wage-earners and as child carers, guiding their children from being totally dependent objects towards a life more and more independent from parents and family where they become active subjects and agents in their own right able to search for their âtrue selfâ (KjÃ¸rholt 2008; Nilsen 2008).

We tested convergence properties of CA Krylov subspace methods based on the monomial basis vectors (P-CACG, P-MBCG) and the Chebyshev basis vectors (P-CBCG). In the comparison between the P-CACG and P-MBCG methods, which are based on three term recurrences and two term recurrences, the latter showed slightly improved convergence. However, the convergence of both solvers were limited for s âª 10. On the other hand, the convergence of the P-CBCG method was extended to s â¼ 40, and the robustness of CA Krylov solvers was dramatically improved. Strong scaling tests of the P-CG, P-CACG (s = 3), and P-CBCG (s = 12) solvers were performed using 500, 1,000, and 2,000 processors on ICEX and KNL. On ICEX, the computational costs were dominated by the computation part, and all three solvers showed good strong scaling. As the communication part is minor, the P-CG solver was fastest on ICEX. On the other hand, on KNL, the computation part was significantly accelerated, and the remaining communication part, in particular, All reduce became a severe bottleneck. By reducing the cost of All reduce, the best performance was achieved by the P-CBCG solver, and the P-CBCG solver is 1.38Ã and 1.17Ã faster than the P-CG and P-CACG solvers at 2,000 processors, respectively. As the P-CBCG method satisfies both high computational performance and excellent robustness, it is promising algorithm for extreme scale simulations on future exascale machines with limited network and memory bandwidths.

137,496,0.197,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"of family obligations. Therefore leave uptake was often combined with part-time work as a long-term solution for being involved fathersâa decision which however entailed non-negligible career consequences. Finally, the study uncovers implications of fathersâ leave uptake on the societal level. Fathers on leave alone can be viewed as agents of social change. On playgrounds and in supermarkets, they play a part in âundoing genderâ and transgressing gendered norms of parenthood (Deutsch 2007). Within companies, with their leave uptake and their part-time work, respondents make fatherhood more visible in organizational life and challenge the meaning of masculinity (Burnett et al. 2012; Hojgaard 1997). The leave experience can even take an activist dimension; with the aim to advance gender equality and the social recognition of fatherhood. This dimension is probably linked to the Swiss context, as men are currently not recognized as caregivers by the state. However, similar cases were found in Quebec, where menâs leave entitlements are more developed (Tremblay 2014). Altogether, fathersâ small-scale transgressive actions can be seen as challenging the institutional level of the gender structure, as conceptualized by Risman (1998, 2004, 2011). To conclude, this explorative qualitative study on men taking leave alone sheds light on the different types of leave situations that exist in the Swiss context. It shows that in the absence of statutory leave policies for fathers, leave uptake has a high price, which only few are willing and able to pay. The study gives insights in the leave experiences of these pioneer fathers, highlighting the positive experience it represents as well as its challenges. It also analyzes the implications of leave uptake for fatherhood and gender equality, revealing a mixed picture among respondents. While it is clear that leave uptake was not equally transformative for all interviewees, findings suggest it also has a societal impact. Men on leave alone in Switzerland can be viewed as agents of social change contributing to the redefinition of the cultural meaning of fatherhood.

Methane gas hydrate can occur as three different crystalline structures, and all have been observed in nature (Figure 5.59) (Brooks et al. 1984; Sassen and MacDonald 1994; Sassen et al. 2000). Gas hydrates have been recovered at many sites on the continental slope and abyss in the Gulf of Mexico over the past three decades (Figure 5.60) (Boswell et al. 2012). The first documented physical retrieval of gas hydrate in the shallow subsurface of the Gulf of Mexico was in a Deep-Sea Drilling Project core from the Orca Basin in 1983 when small crystals were determined to be biogenic methane hydrates (DSDP96 in Figure 5.60) (Pflaum et al. 1986). As noted above, in 1984 the first retrieval of near-surface thermogenic gas hydrate in nature was reported in the deepwater region of the Gulf of Mexico (GC 185, Figure 5.60) (Brooks et al. 1984). Thermogenic gas hydrate was recovered from the upper few meters of bottom sediments associated with oil-stained cores in a water depth of 530 m (1,739 ft) close to the limit of gas-hydrate stability. Gas hydrate occurred sporadically associated with sediment seismic wipe-out zones within an area of at least several hundred square kilometers (100 km2 Â¼ 38.6 mi2). In 1994, the first recovery of structure H gas hydrate in nature was reported in the deepwater region of the Gulf of Mexico (Sassen and MacDonald 1994). In the following years, gas hydrates were shown to be associated with vents, carbonate hard grounds, and shallow fault systems at the margins of salt structures, and hydrate gases were correlated with deeper-reservoired gases (Brooks et al. 1986; Sassen et al. 1999a, b; Milkov and Sassen 2000, 2001; Milkov et al. 2000).

There were two other new, and very important, very helpful, international committees as partners in the detector building story â a Technical Review Committee (the Gilchriese Committee), and the International Finance Committee, the IFC. The Technical Review Committee worked closely with the Detector collaboration, met twice per year through the construction period, and provided advice to both the Spokesperson and the laboratory. The committee worked in sub-committees on speciï¬c aspects of the detector construction, or as requested by either the Spokesperson or the Research Director. In practice, the collaboration used this committee in its preparation for the formal technical reviews by DOE â the Lehman Reviews. The IFC met twice per year to review progress of the construction, discuss with the lab management and the Spokesperson progress and concerns, and to set homework for lab and collaboration. Members of the group were very used to working together from many years doing just this same exercise at CERN, trusted each other and the agencies they represented, and took a strong, stewarding responsibility for their new charge â the ï¬edgling North Americanhosted BABAR experiment. They met by phone in between regular face-to-face sessions when serious, timeurgent problems came up, and were very eï¬ective in ï¬nding solutions to the unexpected problems when they arose. The IFC were able to ensure that BABAR could draw together a critical mass of manpower and institutional support from each of the regions working on the experiment, to ensure success on the central areas of the experiment construction. They, as a group, appreciated that SLAC and the US would carry the largest share of the expenses for building and operating the experiment, but participated in solving all of the many problems that arose as âour joint problemâ. Largely because of their long history on other experiments at CERN, and the mutual trust they had built up, they were a very important component in guiding and enabling an extraordinary experiment.

260,131,0.196,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"While LMBV grew slightly faster at 30 Â°C than 25 Â°C, it did not replicate past one day in cell culture when held at 35 Â°C, probably because largemouth bass typically inhabit aquatic systems that do not exceed 30 Â°C (Eaton and Scheller 1996; Grant et al. 2003). Thus, there is strong evidence that ranavirus replication is highly temperature- and host-dependent (Speare and Smith 1992; Grant et al. 2003; Rojas et al. 2005; Ariel et al. 2009b). To the extent that replication in vitro represents replication rates in vivo, we would expect that the rates of viral replication and host mortality would generally increase with temperature. Results from several studies are consistent with this hypothesis. In experimental water bath challenges of adult redfin perch, all of the fish held at water temperatures of 12â21 Â°C died, while those at 6â10 Â°C either did not become infected or quickly cleared the infection (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995). Experimental challenges of European stocks of redfin perch and rainbow trout with EHNV also found that mortality increased with temperature (from 15 to 20 Â°C), and significant mortality was not observed at 10 Â°C (Ariel and Jensen 2009). Similarly, Bayley et al. (2013) reported >96 % mortality of the common frog tadpoles exposed to ranaviruses (FV3 [Frog virus 3] or REV [Rana esculenta virus]) at 20 Â°C but <32 % when exposed to ranaviruses at 15 Â°C. A contrasting pattern was observed in a study conducted with larval tiger salamanders and ATV (Rojas et al. 2005). Larvae exposed to ATV and reared at 10 or 18 Â°C experienced >80 % mortality, while larvae reared at 26 Â°C experienced <38 % mortality. Viral titers were higher in salamanders that died at 10 Â°C than 18 Â°C, suggesting that colder temperature may have suppressed immune responses to ATV. There is also evidence in turtles that temperature influences the outcome of infection. Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) infected with FV3 experienced 100 % mortality at 22 Â°C but 50 % mortality at 28 Â°C (Allender et al. 2013b). Additionally, time to death was shorter and viral loads greater in turtles at 22 Â°C compared to those at 28 Â°C. Allender et al. (2013b) hypothesized that cell-mediated or humoral immune responses could be enabling turtles to clear infections at higher temperatures. Instead of focusing on the kinetics of viral replication and host immune responses, temperature could be a stressor in and of itself. Bayley et al. (2013) found greater mortality in R. temporaria tadpoles held at 20 Â°C than at 15 Â°C when exposed to FV3, PPIV (Pike perch iridovirus), and REV, but mortality was also greater at 20 Â°C in the unexposed control animals, suggesting that the higher temperature was generally stressful. Several fish challenges have shown increased mortality at temperatures near the fishesâ thermal limits (Whittington and Reddacliff 1995; Grant et al. 2003). Ariel and Jensen (2009) noted that mortality in rainbow trout exposed to EHNV was highest at 20 Â°C, which is beyond the natural temperature range for this species and likely stressful or immunosuppressive. The redfin perch in their study, however, experienced the greatest mortality at intermediate temperaturesâtwice as much at 15 Â°C than 20 Â°C, and very little at 10 Â°Câso temperature-induced stress appears not to be important in this species. Perhaps viral replication was favored at 15 Â°C more than the hostâs immune system, whereas the immune system was dominant at 20 Â°C (Ariel and Jensen 2009). Similarly, Echaubard et al. (2014) found that the rate of mortality in experimental epidemics with northern leopard frog and wood"
