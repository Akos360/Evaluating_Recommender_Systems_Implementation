Large numbers of leatherback sea turtles are captured each year in the Gulf as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. Hawksbills are the rarest of the five species of sea turtle that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and their current abundance is only a fraction of historical levels because millions were killed for tortoiseshell (jewelry, combs, brushes, buttons, etc.) during the past 100 years. Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal. In summary, because sea turtles are difficult to study and since some species have been studied more than others, there are significant gaps in the data available by species, as well as by life stage. However, despite the data gaps and limitations associated with selected data sets"
337,24,0.42,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"science during environmental crises through two case studies â the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Sandy. Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known"

Everyone has their own examplesâICMIâs Klein Project is a multilingual collection of contemporary mathematics written for teachers. It would be nice if the pleasure that we get from mathematics imbued the whole of mathematics education, but we know it does not. Why not? How do we manage to take the pleasure out of mathematics? This question underlies all that follows. Let me now return to Ubiratan DâAmbrosio. It is an honour to be following up Ubiratan DâAmbrosioâs thinking, so let me briefly, and with a broad brush-stroke, go over what he was on about. He questioned inequity within mathematics education in a very fundamental way, and gave us some models for working towards creating a fairer world through a mathematics education that really paid attention to social and cultural issues. Many, many people have worked very strongly in this area, and I do not intend to give a summary of the comprehensive work that has been done. In more recent years, Ubiratan DâAmbrosio started to talk about mathematics as a dorsal spine. I want to highlight this metaphor because it is a very nice way of thinking about what has happened. He sees mathematics as the dorsal spine of civilization, the basis of science and technology (DâAmbrosio, 2007, 2015). The trouble is that you may have a spine and skeleton on which an animal may be built, but that animal sometimes turns into a monster rather than a beautiful creature. This has happened within mathematics, and, I would argue, within mathematics education. DâAmbrosio suggests that our essential goals are responsible creativity and ethical citizenship. What he did was highlight the role of mathematics and mathematics education in achieving both of those goals. In other words, he was pointing us to the wider reasons for our work as mathematicians and mathematics educators. But how? How do we do this? What is it I am supposed to do to engender responsible creativity and ethical citizenship? When I walk up the steps and go into my ofï¬ce, what actions will I take? I can presumably do some things in the way I behave, but how do I help to engender appropriate actions in the students that I teach? How are we to build a beautiful creature and not a monster. I think that DâAmbrosioâs essential message is that we should reinstate cultural processes within mathematics education in order to build beautiful creatures. I wish to think about what other things we might do. To develop a basis for making possible actions more explicit I would like to invoke ecological systems theory, which was developed in the context of child development by Urie Bronfenbrenner in 1979, a couple of years after DâAmbrosio introduced the ethnomathematical approach. The two theories have some overlapping principles (Bronfenbrenner, 1992)."

Mortalities from speeding watercraft have been the highest overall source of mortality, but there is some indication that with greater education and enforcement, these are on the wane. Cold stress due to periodic shutdown of power plants used as refuges by manatees has also decreased in recent years, due to concerted human action.

71,1409,0.391,Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides: Volume 1 ISDR-ICL Sendai Partnerships 2015-2025 (Volume 1.0),"Terraces, traditionally sustained by dry stonewalls, occupy about thirty percent of the territory of Liguria. If constantly maintained, they effectively contribute to slow down the natural slope erosion. When no longer managed, terraces may increase geomorphological risk along the slopes and, consequently, at the bottom of the valley (Brandolini et al. 2012). Bad weather such as flash rain worsen the background hazard causing severe damages and devastation across Italy and weight over the economy of a country that has to faces a large variety of disasters. Italy faces emergency but efforts on prevention are not enough to deal with the problem. Emergency often announced with âstate of alertâ, and results in schools closure to try minimize the number of people on the roads during heavy rain. In addition to damage to infrastructure and housing, bad weather also affects agriculture. According to Coldiretti (Italyâs largest agricultural association) heavy rain, overflown rivers and landslides will cost millions of euros to the agricultural sector due to land and crop damage. Farmland overflown with water, vegetables production and plants cultivation located near rivers registered the worst images. The terraced landscape is very common in the Ligurian region, covering about of the 30% of the territory. Agricultural terraces are sustained by dry stonewalls and reduce the slow down the natural slope erosion, but if no regularly maintained, can worst the risk of landslides and âdetritus flowâ. Since 1970 recurring floods affect Genoa where the Bisagno Stream catchment flows across the eastern part of city center. The most recent and tragic was in October 2014 (Faccini et al. 2016). The 5 Terre peculiarity of little towns cling to sheer hills along a narrow, rugged strip of land between the Maritime Alps, the Apennine Mountains and the Ligurian Sea is results into a heavy geo-hydrological risk. The fragile land conditions turn into instability during unusual meteorological conditions that causes heavy flooding. This happened in October 2011 when the river rushed violently down dislocating and destroying several towns, redeï¬ning the natural architecture of the affected the Vara and Magra Valleys near La Spezia (Piangiamore et al. 2015) (Figs. 2 and 3)."

193,145,0.366,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"The fact that Ukrainian migrants can transfer the money earned abroad personally without having to bear additional transfer costs is an advantage of temporary, especially circular, migration (Grotte 2012). However, qualitative studies on the remitting behaviour of Ukrainian migrants report negative examples of Ukrainian migrants being robbed on the way back to or upon arrival in Ukraine (Grotte 2012; Kindler 2011). A study conducted in Italy (Weber 2004) indicates that difficulty in re-negotiating social status when back in Ukraine may constitute a constraint on return, and rather a motivation to remain abroad longer than initially intended, going home only for short periods of time. This shows that the âstatus tensionsâ experienced by temporary migrants, as well as by their children, are strongly linked to their statuses in their countries of origin, which can impact not only temporal patterns of mobility but also the well-being of both migrants and their families. This also demonstrates that lowprestige work in the destination country does deprive migrants of their social status, partially challenging the claim put forward, for example, by the dual labour market theory of Piore (1979) that such deprivation should be lower or non-existent in the case of temporary migrants. This is due to the fact that the Ukrainian migrants studied had experienced tensions about their social position in the country of origin. The risk of deskilling or de-qualification is high for temporary Ukrainian migrants (see Triandafyllidou 2011; Caglar et al. 2011; Iglicka et al. 2011). The temporary migration of Ukrainian citizens is often related to temporary jobs that do not require high skills and belong to the so-called secondary sector of the labour market. Consequently, studies in a number of countries have found loss of skills among educated Ukrainian migrants performing low-skilled jobs (Antoniewski and KoryÅ 2002; Shakhno and Pool 2005; Fedyuk 2012). For example, a study based on two national surveys of foreigners in the Czech Republic provides evidence of a significant waste of human capital among Ukrainians (Leontiyeva 2014; see also Chap. 8). A crucial finding of this study is that migrants âwith permanent residence permits turned out to be twice as likely to have skilled jobs compared to those with temporary residence permits and were half as likely to end up on the bottom rungs of the labour marketâ (Leontiyeva 2014:74). This suggests that the temporal dimension of migration, related to legal status on the Czech labour market, intersects with the risk of deskilling among migrants, which tends to be higher for temporary migrants. Irregular stay means higher risks and consequently higher mobility costs between Ukraine and the country of migration (see Chap. 4). However, paradoxically, efforts to gain legal status, even temporary, or to take part in seasonal migrant worker programmes, may lead to negative financial and other consequences for migrants."
390,578,0.363,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"ur lives are full of repetition. We count the days through the natural rhythms of the rotation of the earth, the revolution of the moon around the earth, and of the earth around the sun. Each day is different, but our lives are often structured by standard routines that are similar from day to day. In a sense, repetition is also the essence of computing. Nobody needs a computer to add two numbers together. (Letâs hope not, anyway!) But adding a thousand or a million numbers together? Thatâs a job for a computer. This relationship of computing and repetition was obvious early on. In Ada Lovelaceâs famous 1843 discussion of Charles Babbageâs Analytical Engine, she wrote: Both for brevity and for distinctness, a recurring group is called a cycle. A cycle of operations, then, must be understood to signify any set of operations which is repeated more than once. It is equally a cycle, whether it be repeated twice only, or an indefinite number of times; for it is the fact of a repetition occurring at all that constitutes it such. In many cases of analysis there is a recurring group of one or more cycles; that is, a cycle of a cycle, or a cycle of cycles."

222,232,0.351,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The number of historical flood events from 1954 to 2014, categorised by extent, are shown in Table 8.1 (BWDB 2015). Extreme, dry and average flood years are defined by the national area flooded. Twenty-five per cent of all flood events occurred during extreme flood years and caused significant damage. Two typical examples of fluvial floods, one for an average flood condition (year 2000) and one for an extreme flood condition (year 1998), are shown in Fig. 8.2. The location of the discharge measurement stations are the entry points of the rivers into Bangladesh from India. The Brahmaputra water level starts rising from the early monsoon (JuneâJuly) and reaches its first peak in the third week of July. It then falls and rises again and, in an average flood year, attains its second peak in the first week of August. The Ganges has a single peak of flood level occurring in the second week of September. For the Upper Meghna, the first flood peak occurs in the second or third week of May, and, in an average flood year, a second peak occurs close to the second peak of the Brahmaputra. The effect of flow from the Upper Meghna on overall flooding is small as its discharge only represents ten per cent of the combined discharges of Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers (Islam et al. 2010). The different timing of the flood peaks of the major rivers are mainly due to variations in rainfall in the upper catchments and the travel time to reach the discharge measurement points considered. Synchronisation of the peaks across the three rivers is rare, but has occurred: the floods of 1988 and 1998 (see Fig. 8.2) being examples (Islam and Chowdhury 2002). During peak synchronisation, the second peak of the Brahmaputra is delayed or may occur as a third peak coinciding with the single peak of the Ganges. This triggers significant fluvial flooding in Bangladesh."
311,792,0.35,The Physics of the B Factories,"Their choice avoids unphysical singularities which are generated at q 2 = t+ by the outer function in a truncated BGL parameterization. Further, Bourrely, Caprini, and Lellouch (2009) optimize the parameter t0 such that the semileptonic domain is mapped onto a symmetric interval in z. With the choice t0 = (mB + mÏ )( mB â mÏ )2 , the value of |z| < 0.279. Although the BCL parameterization has a simpler functional form, the constraint on the series is more complicated than Eq. (17.1.50) in that it is no longer diagonal in the series index k. We use the BCL parameterization to obtain |Vub | in Section 17.1.4.3. A diï¬erent approach suggested by Flynn and Nieves (2007a,b) uses the OmneÌs parameterization, allowing one to express the form-factor shape in terms of the elastic BÏ scattering phase shift and the value of f+ (q 2 ) at a few subtraction points below the BÏ production threshold. Lattice QCD form-factor calculations State-of-the-art LQCD computations now regularly include the eï¬ects of three light dynamical quarks. Often calculations are done in the isospin limit with two lighter degenerate quarks and one heavier quark with a mass close to the physical strange quark; these are referred to as â2+1â ï¬avor simulations. In practice, limited computational resources prohibit calculations with simulated values of the u- and d-quark as light as those in the real world. LQCD calculations must also be done at ï¬xed, nonzero values of the lattice spacing. Hence one generates data with a sequence of light-quark masses (down to â¼ mstrange /10 for current B â Ï calculations) and a sequence of lattice spacings (down to a â¼ 0.09 fm for current B â Ï calculations) and extrapolates the remainder of the way to the physical masses and zero lattice spacing. Because these limits are interrelated, it is now standard to use model-independent functional forms derived in Chiral Perturbation Theory (ÏPT) for the speciï¬c lattice quark formulation being used (i.e. including discretization corrections) to guide the extrapolation (see, e.g., Aubin and Bernard, 2007, for the case of B â Ï).

TNF-Î± is an important molecule in mechanical loading force-induced osteoclast formation in the periodontal ligament during orthodontic tooth movement. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between TNF-Î±-induced osteoclast formation and the cytokines expressed during mechanical loading. Th1 cytokines inhibited osteoclast and odontoclast formation during mechanical loading in the periodontal ligament. There is a possibility that local injection of Th1 cytokines might be a useful tool to enhance the anchorage site and control the rate of tooth movement during orthodontic treatment, as well as prevent relapse after orthodontic treatment. Moreover, local injection of Th1 cytokines might be a useful tool in reducing root resorption, particularly for highrisk teeth.

In Denmark, the public sector reached a maximum in 2010 with 549,000 full-time employees, and in Sweden it peaked in 2007 with 974,000 employees.3 Although the public-sector shares still may seem large in comparative perspective, they are decreasing in real numbers primarily as a result of for-proï¬t growth. This adds a new feature to the âsocial democratic modelâ, previously characterized by high public welfare spending and a small nonproï¬t sector. The public sector was preferred as a service provider to ensure unitary standards and equal access for all (Anheier and Salamon 2006; Salamon and Anheier 1998). For-proï¬t sector growth also sets the Scandinavian countries apart from the corporatist and liberal countries, which have much larger nonproï¬t sectors (Salamon et al. 2004). To sum up, in Sweden, the public-sector employment has decreased in real numbers, and a decline has recently started in Denmark too. In Norway, with no need for austerity measures, all three sectors still grow in real numbers, although the public sectorâs share decreases slightly. In all three Scandinavian countries, the for-proï¬t providers are increasing their shares of the welfare employment faster than the nonproï¬ts. The gap between the sectors is growing fastest in Sweden, where the nonproï¬ts remain very small while the for-proï¬t share has doubled. This has resulted in a dramatic shift from the public sector to the for-proï¬t sector"

158,1,0.321,Microfinance 3.0 : Reconciling Sustainability With Social Outreach and Responsible Delivery,"Fifteen years ago, microfinance was looked upon as one of the most promising concept to lift poor people out of poverty. Microfinance was perceived to be âgood per seâ. Many institutions proved successful both in development and in financial terms. Today, after an impressive pushing of the âfinancial frontierâ, financial inclusion seems to have a mixed record: While it is true that many people in developing countries still lack access to finance, we have also witnessed the opposite âtoo much/easy accessâ led to overindebted clients, unable to serve their several microcredits offered by (too) many institutions. In some markets, this implied a move into pure consumer lending, partly replacing the traditional lending to micro-entrepreneurs. âGoodâ responsible microfinance institutions were not able to continue to operate in these âcontaminated marketsâ. In this context, the question (re-)emerged: isnât it, after all, unrealistic to believe that pursuing a development mission can go hand in hand with financial success, particularly in the context of commercial microfinance? I do not share this view. In fact, I believe the two goals are intertwined in the sense that without financial viability, clients cannot be served in a sustainable way, and that institutions which do not understand their clients with their financial needs will hardly be financially successful. However, this does not happen automatically: on the contrary, it takes a lot of efforts to achieve both objectives: a high degree of professionalism and a strong commitment to a responsible service delivery. It also takes responsible regulators and more efforts to promote financial literacy of clients. This book is part of a publication series initiated by KfW on selected topics in the field of financial systems development, one of the core competencies of KfW. This edition addresses the ethics of financial systems development which have been under scrutiny in âdevelopedâ markets as well as in developing countries. As âbankingâ seems to have become a questionable activity, we will take a special look at the institutions that provide microfinance services. âMicrofinance 3.0â intends to provide a new âframeworkâ for the future of microfinance which builds upon past success stories as well as upon lessons learnt from bad practices and errors. It contains nine contributions, written by different microfinance experts, distinguished practitioners as well as observers and analysts of microfinance for more than a decade. Some of these contributions were presented at the KfW Financial Sector Symposium in late 2012 in Berlin, where the future landscape of microfinance was discussed. These contributions touch upon some of the âingredients of âmicrofinance 3.0â: the values needed to provide financial services responsibly, the appropriate busi-"

Winter season natural gas usage has skyrocketed. Taking Beijing as an example, its heating season (NovemberâMarch each year) accounts for approximately 76% of annual gas usage, with winter and summer peak and trough having a ratio of 12.5:1.

This was a period of innovation in mental health care across many developing countries, in which the WHO then sought out their guiding role. Following initial discussions on the organisation of mental health care, many of the psychiatrists who participated in regional and international conferences continued to seek out advocacy roles. In 1975, a more politically inclined Association of Psychiatrists in Africa changed its name to the Association of African Psychiatrists, reflecting both the increased number of indigenous-born psychiatrists on the continent as well as a desire for Observer status in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The notion of African psychiatrists having a unique perspective on the problems of mental illness in Africa was also reflected in the title of the Associationâs new African Journal of Psychiatry, of which Muhangi was Assistant Editor-in-Chief.74 In the longer term, however, African psychiatrists have contributed disproportionately little to research and policy within the field of international mental health. The Association of African Psychiatrists, along with its journal, collapsed in 1981 just as structural adjustment policies were starting to cripple health systems and universities, resulting in little time, funding and training for experiments or research. Reductions in travel allowances, combined with ongoing difficulties of staffing, have made it more difficult for psychiatrists to participate in conferences beyond national borders, and barriers to research and publication have resulted in relatively little research being published in international journals. While some psychiatrists continued to consult for the WHO, most did not, focusing on keeping psychiatry going within their own countries, often in difficult economic and political circumstances. Since the mid-1990s, most professional activity among psychiatrists has been limited to a regional sphere of influence. The Uganda Psychiatric Association has met for regular conferences since its formation in 1996. Psychiatrists in East Africa have met at annual scientific conferences since 1999, and a new and expanded African Association of Psychiatrists and Allied Professionals was formed in the early 2000s, starting with a meeting in Nairobi. Such activity, particularly since the early 2000s, suggests an important body of knowledge and experience that should play a central role in determining international, now global mental health policy, but which has nevertheless seen relatively little circulation outside of the continent.75"

By the end of the eighteenth century, however, ordinary people throughout Europe were far more likely to want to see suicide as the result of mental illness and to try to circumvent traditional, religious or legal requirements that suicides be denied normal burial.34 However, attitudes towards taking oneâs own life show considerable variation even in the eighteenth century and were affected by the circumstances of the suicide. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, suicide was considered a crime under both secular and canon law. Those who committed suicide in order to escape the justice of the State were double criminals. Since the means of death had been taken from the State, other forms of punishment were placed upon the suicide, foremost among which were post-mortem punishment of the body and forfeiture of the Estate. As Houston notes, forfeiture was âa token of blame and of âapologyââ, but the punishment of the body was both more shameful and more punitive.35 MacDonald and Murphyâs history of suicide records that the normal punishment for suicides until 1823 was forfeiture and profane burial. The 1823 Act ended the custom of profane burial for suicides, but it is noteworthy that profane burial was never a universal and legally enshrined rule: the 1823 act only put a stop to a local customary practice which had already fallen out of use in many parts of the country, as a more sympathetic attitude to suicides gained ground. In fact, Houston contends that profane burial in the form of highway burial with a stake through the body was predominantly a southeast English custom and that widely variable practices are described in provincial newspaper and legal accounts of the disposal of the suicideâs body. Houston notes, for example, that in 50 years of the Cumberland Pacquet only 3 of 18 suicides reported in the northern counties of England were linked to unusual burials: one staked at a crossroads, one on Lancaster Moor and one buried at Low Water mark. All three are from 1790â1791 and might 34 MacDonald and Murphy, Sleepless Souls. See also the essays in Jeffrey Watt (ed.)

We need to investigate methodologies for the accountability, because in the envisioned edge/fog computing environment, users can flexibly share their spare resources to host applications. The hybrid resource continuum from edge/fog to Cloud calls for studying dynamic pricing mechanisms, similar to the spot instance pricing from Amazon EC2 service2 . The ability of monitoring the elasticity of a system/application deployed in a large-scale, dispersed and multi-provider hybrid environment requires investigation. How to quantify and measure the elasticity of a complex distributed system? As regards elasticity, we can quantify its performance by considering the number of missing or superfluous adaptations over time, the durations in sub-optimal states, and the amount of over-/under-provisioned resources [35]. However, how to measure such quantities in a dispersed, large-scale environment with multiple providers turns out to be challenging. Similarly to Cloud computing, we need to identify (or develop) efficient business models that support and encourage the diffusion of trusted computing resources and the elasticity requirements for such business models. One of the most important challenge arises from the lack of central controlling authorities in the edge/fog computing environment, which makes it difficult to assert whether a device is hosting an application component. Security aspects are of key importance, because nowadays the value of data is very high and an infrastructure that does not guarantee stringent security properties will be hardly adopted. Similarly for the accountability issue, the decentralization of the emerging environment requires to deal with the lack of a central security authority. Sophisticated yet lightweight security mechanisms and policies should be introduced, so to create a disseminated trustworthy environment."

In spite of getting electoral support from these groups, many of the governments have later disqualiï¬ed or consciously attempted to co-opt some of them (Zibechi, 2010; Bowen, 2011), while new elites emerge.

31,47,0.294,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Towards a Typology of Harms For reasons of analytical clarity it is worth distinguishing between different orders of harm. â¢ First order intrinsic harms, which causally affect living persons and not dead bodies. The dead body, by virtue of being a corpse is beyond experiencing intrinsic harm of any order. â¢ First and Second order symbolic harms are either harms to the interests of those who once existed (first order symbolic harms to antemortem persons), or they are biographical harms that occur after death and to a posthumous reputation (second order symbolic harms). The FeinbergâPitcher thesis considers the first, but not the second. First order symbolic harms accrue to the transcendent interests of ante-mortem persons. Second order symbolic harms are harrmful post-mortem re-figurations of what once living persons interests were thought to be. They can be thought of as harms to memory and biography. Posthumous harms, moreoverâ are not free-floating, they accrue to a living subject bearer, normally in the form of a relative or friend who is concerned that the memory of their dead is not misrepresented. The living are witness to the fidelity of memory and its rightful conservation. They are surrogate interest bearers for the transcendant interests of those now dead. â¢ Second order intrinsic harms are intrinsic harms to significant others who are related to or care about the deceased and experience the hurt of how they are disremembered. They tend to be psychological harms and rely in a narrative investment about how someone ought to be remembered. Being disremembered causes psychological distress in those that invest truth in a certain memorial narrative. Most commonly, it may be experienced by survivors who hear others âspeaking illâ of their dead relatives or friends. More dramatically it may be experienced by a relative as a deliberate and intentional attempt to dishonour the dead and even to refigure their memory as particularly notorious. Usually disremembering the dead is expressed through the spoken or written word when this is not what they deserved. Second order intrinsic harms can be experienced by others as harm to the corpse itself. While it is not possible to harm a mouldering corpse in itself, the corpse has a symbolic unity for the living that needs to be respected, in particular by those who grieve âtheirâ"

In the ï¬rst two project years, three different managers were in charge with different attitudes towards the project and its implementation. In certain periods, the project was overshadowed by the companyâs business issues, and its objectives were put to the background. While the company owner together with Mr. Supportive drove the project, some managers perceived the project rather being vague than closely related to the concrete business model of the company. This resulted in some discrepancies in management. The management installed during the evaluation decided to foster the project implementation, but simultaneously to focus on factory operation, as it pursued cost cutting and similar measures as part of its crisis management. Furthermore, the owner moved to the background, as his daughter became part of the new management team. 4.4.3.4 Takeaways from the Case Company A and the regional IT consultancy project partner analyzed the project implementation and identiï¬ed a list of experiences and events that have had impact on the project results. Undoubtedly, the project has created the unique opportunity for both partners to develop innovative solutions, and the project implementation will be deï¬nitely useful for different types of production companies. Selected lessons learnt are presented subsequently. Continuously discuss the project progress with relevant stakeholders In the course of project implementation, Company A has experienced signiï¬cant changes on the management and worker level. For instance, due to the required increase of production efï¬ciency, a crisis manager was hired. New managers seemed not always to be committed to the project objectives. Therefore, they did not support the project implementation adequately. It is advisable to discuss continuously the project course with the management and more precisely present the project impact on the current as well as on future production. The same applies to workers. In the case where the workers who were actively involved in the solution design leave the company and the workers who were not part of the design process evaluate the solution, incoherent results are very likely.

In practice, a single transmitter and receiver pair can operate with a bandwidth of 10â20 GHz for transmission distances of some tens of kilometers. Optical amplifiers, which most commonly operate at wavelengths near 1550 nm, can be used to increase the range of transmission. In the modulation process, the power of the carrier is varied in proportion to the voltage of the signal. Because of this, the effect of small unwanted components in fiber transmission systems is greatly reduced. Consider, for example, a small component of the optical signal resulting from a reflection within the fiber. If the optical power of the reflected component is x dB less than that of the main component, then after demodulation at the photodetector, the signal power contributed by the reflected component is 2x dB less than that from the main optical component. This also applies to small unwanted effects resulting from finite isolation of couplers, isolators, and other elements. Variations in the frequency response resulting from standing waves in microwave transmission lines are significantly less in optical fiber than in cable. A feature that must be taken into account in applications of optical fiber is the dispersion in velocity, D, usually specified in ps.nm # km/!1 . The difference in the time of propagation for two optical wavelengths that differ by ""$ traveling a distance ` in the fiber is D""$`. Figure 7.3 shows the dispersion for two types of fiber. Curve 1 is for a type of fiber widely used in early applications, and curve 2 represents a design in which the zero-dispersion wavelength is shifted to coincide approximately with the minimum-attenuation wavelength of 1550 nm. This optimization of the performance at 1550 nm is achieved by designing the fiber so that the dispersion of the cylindrical waveguide formed by the core of the fiber cancels the intrinsic dispersion of the glass at that wavelength. Consider a spectral component, at frequency !m , of a broadband signal that is modulated onto an optical carrier. Amplitude modulation of the signal results in sidebands spaced Ë!m in frequency with respect to the carrier. Because of the velocity dispersion, the two sidebands and the carrier each propagate down the fiber with slightly different velocities and thus exhibit relative offsets in time at the receiving end. Such time offsets result in attenuation of the amplitude of the high-frequency components of analog signals and in broadening of the pulses used to represent digital data. Thus, for both analog and digital transmission, dispersion Fig. 7.3 Dispersion D in single-mode optical fiber of two different designs, as a function of the optical wavelength."
117,170,0.282,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"This example shows Leandra doing will-work. She wants to shower Ms Koch.16 In order to do this, she needs Ms Koch to want to shower, or at least to not refuse it. Leandraâs initial use of the generic âyouâ indicates that entering the room cheerfully is a more general way of approaching residents. But she then adjusts to the person herself and to the severity of the residentâs condition, as is evidenced in Ms Kochâs example. In other words, generalisations are not useful here. To get Ms Koch to want to shower, Leandra attempts to sculpt her mood. Although sometimes ânothing worksâ and wanting remains not amenable to Leandra to work upon it, sometimes it does work: in those situations, Leandraâs smile causes Ms Koch to âalso become cheerfulâ, to âmagnify the emotionâ and to relax. This, in turn, results in her allowing Leandra âto do moreâ, including giving her a shower. In another example of this way of doing will-work, Joani often brought three cups of hot chocolate to Ms Veenstra along with her medicine. We drank the chocolate by her bedside together. Meanwhile, we talked about the weather or what we had done yesterday, or about the joint breakfast awaiting her downstairs. By doing this, Joani hoped to get Ms Veenstra into the mood for getting out of bed, and it often worked. In those cases, what Ms Veenstra wanted was aligned with Joaniâs desire for her to have breakfast, and for her to be with others. Sculpting moods and emotions is one way to align wanting. Two important conclusions can be drawn from this. Firstly, the story affirms that moods and emotions cannot be separated from wanting.17 Secondly, it shows will-work as a relational practice: Ms Koch and Leandra are"

The utilitarian point of view is also reflected in the increased focus on skills and employability in the EC. In many countries, this debate is progressively becoming interlinked with the debate on quality and quality assurance (e.g. the Danish committee on quality and relevance of higher education). While there is clearly a link between quality of education and employability, there is also a great danger in establishing a simplistic and linear connection between the two. There is a real danger that the essential âbildungâ and the civic development aspects of higher education is overlooked if a purely utilitarian approach is adopted. If a simple and linear correlation is introduced, the process of diversiï¬cation of higher education, providing access to education to students from all backgrounds throughout a studentâs life is often disregarded. If the goals of permeability, diversiï¬cation and flexibility are ignored, then quality assurance can create conformity rather than innovation, and the overriding aim of creating a Europe of Knowledge for an increasingly diverse student population might be lost."
337,299,0.278,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"addressing interactions among individuals. The explicit attention for interactions between agents makes it possible for this type of model to simulate emergent properties of systems. These are properties at the macro scale that are not predictable from observing the micro units in isolation. If the decision rules of the agents are set such that they sufficiently look like human decision making they can simulate behavior at the meso-level of social organization, i.e. the behavior of heterogeneous groups of actors. Multi-agent-based models of land change are particularly well suited to representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions (Bousquet and Le Page 2004; Parker et al. 2003). Multi-agent systems are able to formalize decision-forming behavior of individual stakeholders, either based on theory (Happe et al. 2006), or based on observations and statistical analysis (Bousquet et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2007; Valbuena et al. 2010a). In the initial years of application of agent-based models to land change, most multi-agent models focused on either hypothetical or simplified representations of the real world to explore interactions between agents and between agents and the environment. Especially the parameterization of agent behavior in models for real case-studies turned out to be very complex. However, more recently a larger number of applications of agent-based models to real case studies worldwide have been published, showing the potential of the approach to explore the land change dynamics in local to regional level case studies (Le et al. 2012; Robinson et al. 2012; Valbuena et al. 2010b). At larger spatial scales, ranging from the region to the global level the principles of agent-based modeling have not yet been applied in simulation models, leaving most models at that level with highly simplified representations of human-environment interactions (Rounsevell and Arneth 2011). The possibilities for either upscaling or outscaling agent-based models have been described by Rounsevell and colleagues (Rounsevell et al. 2012), but have not yet been applied in operational models."

There are two versions of RSL: a weak one that is sound with respect to the C/C++11 memory model, which features out-of-thin-air reads, and a stronger one that is sound with respect to a variant of the C/C++11 memory that forbids load buffering. The weak version of RSL forbids relaxed writes completely, and does not constrain the value returned by a relaxed read. The stronger version provides singlelocation invariants for relaxed accesses, but its soundness proof relies strongly on a strengthened version of C/C++11 without po âª rf cycles (where po is program order, and rf is the reads-from relation), which forbids load buffering. When it comes to reasoning about coherence properties, even the strong version of RSL is surprisingly weak: it cannot be used to verify any of the coherence examples in this paper. In fact, RSL can be shown sound with respect to much weaker coherence axioms than what C/C++11 relaxed accesses provide.

341,37,0.274,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"that project as regards the four main components of groundwater governance: actors, national legal frameworks, policies and information and knowledge. In addition, the authors address the issue of governance of transboundary groundwater resources and the relevant existing international legal frameworks. In conclusion, through a Global Vision for 2030, this chapter presents a way forwards to govern groundwater and a framework for action to achieve good governance, formulated by the Groundwater Governance Project jointly implemented by UNESCO, FAO, World Bank and IAH. To achieve the goals of the Shared Vision 2030, a Framework for Action has been developed. It describes the main steps to be taken, provides guidance on planning and prioritising actions and is an urgent call for action to all who can make a difference: national and local governments, international organisations, the private sector, civil society, media, educational institutions and professional organisations â but also well owners, groundwater users and concerned citizens everywhere. The main steps elaborated in the Framework for Action are understanding the context, creating a basis for governance, building effective institutions, making essential linkages, redirecting finances and establishing a process of planning and management. The Shared Global Vision for Groundwater Governance 2030 and the Global Framework for Action to achieve the vision on Groundwater Governance call for strengthening groundwater governance. This call for action urges countries, districts, communities, companies, organisations and individuals to safeguard the groundwater resource that is essential to meet their common future objectives and Sustainable Development Goals. This Framework for Action is designed to set in place the groundwater governance arrangements that will achieve this vision. Doug Merrey explores the likely trends and outcomes in water governance with a particular focus on cooperation and conflict over the management of water resources in two regions: South Asia and Southern Africa. With its extremely largescale shared river basins inhabited by nearly a billion mostly poor people, South Asia has struggled to find ways to co-manage water resources to benefit everyone equitably in a context where there is much potential benefit to be achieved. Southern Africa is considered an example of relative success in developing ways to cooperate â but implementation is incredibly complex in systems more water scarce than South Asia, though not as large. They examine the prospects for developing governance arrangements in the two regions through three âlensesâ which they characterise as âbeyond disciplinesâ, âbeyond scalesâ and âbeyond âinstitutionalâ hardware to âhumanâ softwareâ. Even those who have advocated for the role of institutions above, individuals have conceded, as noted for South Asia, that the behaviour of individuals within organisations determines the outcomes. More research needs to be conducted on the role of the individual in actively addressing complex waterrelated challenges, in redefining how multiple sectors cooperate around these issues and ultimately influencing socio-economic development at the regional level. At present, governance structures, organised nationally and transnationally on a basin scale in both regions, presume that âstakeholdersâ can adequately represent themselves in formal settings where allocation, use and management decisions are"

260,266,0.272,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"It is evident from the studies described here that anti-ranaviral immunity is multifaceted, complex, and likely species- and developmental stage-specific. Also evident are the many gaps in our understanding of the immune response to these pathogens as well as possible defects in the hostâs ability to mount effective responses that contain and eliminate these infections. It is particularly worrisome that Ranavirus and other genera within the family Iridoviridae have devised numerous, highly efficient strategies for evading, and even utilizing host immune components, to achieve persistence, facilitate dissemination and expand host range. Clearly, ranaviruses encode a large number of putative gene products, which represent both potential virulence factors as well as promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. While it is easy to dismiss lower vertebrate immune systems as functionally analogous to those of mammals, there is a growing literature suggesting otherwise. It is through the fundamental understanding of the physiological and ecological pressures governing these unique immune systems that we may begin to comprehend ranavirus infection strategies and the immune systems that may, or may not have adequately co-evolved to stop them. The investigation of ranavirus infection and immune subversion strategies should be approached not only by taking into account well-defined mammalian pathogens, but also by considering the possibility that ranaviruses may represent unique viral agents. In contrast to the majority of homeothermic vertebrate pathogens, ranaviruses are extraordinary in their ability to overcome cell and host tropism barriers, while their mechanisms of pathogenicity appear to be (at least partially) much less dependent on viral loads. Indeed, the immune systems of ectothermic hosts have evolved as the result of, and are subject to, different physiological and pathogenic pressures than those that have shaped the mammalian immune system. It stands to reason that ranavirus pathogens have co-evolved with these unique immune systems, thus we must garner greater insights into both to fully understand either.

Jinghe County lies within the Ebinur Lake catchment, and the two study villages are both within the county and within 50 km of the lakeâs shore. Given the low precipitation at the catchment floor of only 60â80 mm per year, the snowmeltfed lake and associated wetlands play an important role in sustaining the regional ecology. Researchers surveyed herder households in two villages, here referred to as Village A and Village B, to document household income and herder opinions on sedentarizationâs effect on grassland health and livelihoods. Prior to sedentarization, all households had annually moved livestock through four seasonal pastures and had similar standards of living, though households in Village A owned more livestock (406 Â± 142) than those in Village B (308 Â± 142).

The energy densities considered are of the order of 0.5â1.5 GeV/fm3 and the relevant temperatures are in the 200 MeV range. The great interest of reaching such conditions originates from recent developments in Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD, which make it very plausible that, while color confinement should prevail under standard circumstances, deconfinement should occur at sufficiently high density and (or) sufficiently high temperature. Under such conditions a new phase of matter, a quark-gluon plasma, is likely to exist. This phase should be viewed as due to a coalescence, or perhaps a percolation, of hadrons into larger entities and not as an actual separation of free quarks! . . . âOver an extended volume where the required density or temperature conditions would prevail, one expects that the properties of the physical vacuum would be modified. While the normal vacuum excludes the gluon field, the color-equivalent of the dielectric constant being zero (or practically zero), one would get a new vacuum state where quarks and gluons could propagate while interacting perturbatively. âThe equivalent of the dielectric constant would now be unity. The required conditions may be reached at high enough densities, hadrons being squeezed into one another, or at high enough temperature, the calculation of the partition function no longer favoring confining configurations whereby a color flux tube of fixed cross section extends between two color sources. The temperature at which the phase transition is expected to occur depends on the density, or on the quark chemical potential. One may thus separate two phases, a hadron phase and a quark gluon plasma, on a density-temperature diagram.. . . âThe presence of a phase transition could long be expected from phenomenological models with an exponentially increasing hadron spectrum. The limiting Hagedorn temperature, obtained as the specific heat of the hadron gas diverges, can"
176,131,0.268,Russia'S Turn To The East : Domestic Policymaking and Regional Cooperation,"In the years leading up to the conflict over Ukraine, oil prices were high, Western countries open to cooperation and foreign companies eager to invest in Russiaâespecially in the petroleum sector. Many Russian companies, including state-controlled oil and gas corporations, took on high levels of debt, based on the assumption that oil prices would remain high. After Crimea, Russia faced not only international sanctions but also a collapse in the price of oil. The combination of the lower oil price and sanctions left Russia economically and politically vulnerable, and potentially dependent on its biggest non-Western trading partner: China. After the introduction of Western sanctions, several major developments took place in Sino-Russian energy cooperation. In May 2014, the two countries reached a deal on the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline, with an estimated value of USD 400 billion (Overland et al. 2015, p.42). During the same year, imports of oil from Russia to China increased by 36 per cent, reaching 30 million tons (Cunningham 2015b). Oil exports from Russia even displaced other suppliers: in 2014, Chinese oil imports from Saudi Arabia fell by 8 per cent and from Venezuela by 11 per cent (Cunningham 2015a; see Fig. 6.1 for further details). This development was one important motivation behind Saudi Arabiaâs unexpected decision to raise oil production and lower the price of oil in 2014, despite the negative impact on Saudi revenues and on intra-OPEC solidarity. These developments create the impression that China was discreetly providing the financial backing for Russiaâs annexation of Crimea. While"

121,467,0.267,Becoming Citizens in a Changing World : IEA International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 International Report,"Civic and citizenship activities in classrooms and teacher preparation Chapter 2 of this report described the general approaches that the ICCS 2016 schools were taking to deliver civic and citizenship education in their classrooms. The chapter also reported principalsâ and teachersâ perceptions of the most important aims of this area of school education, and documented the types of pre-service and in-service training that teachers in the ICCS countries experience. In this section of the current chapter, we look at the activities carried out within participating schoolsâ classrooms during civic and citizenship education lessons from two perspectivesâstudentsâ and teachersâ. We also consider teachersâ responses to a question about their level of preparedness for teaching topics related to civic and citizenship education. The question in the ICCS 2016 student questionnaire on civic topics taught in school required students to indicate the extent to which they had learned about each of the following at their school: (a) âhow citizens can vote in local or national election;â (b) âhow laws are introduced and changed in <country of test>;â (c) âhow to protect the environment (e.g. through energy-saving or recycling);â (d) âhow to contribute to solving problems in the <local community>;â (e) âhow citizen rights are protected in <country of test>;â and (f) âpolitical issues and events in other countries.â We used these items to derive an IRT-based scale called civic learning at school. It had an average reliability across countries (Cronbachâs alpha = 0.80). The higher scale scores indicate higher levels of reported learning of civic issues at school. (For a description of this scale, see the item map in Figure 6.4, Appendix D.) On average across the participating countries, the highest percentages of students who said they had learned about the listed topics to a moderate or large extent were for how to protect the environment (81%), how citizens can vote in local and national elections (64%), and how citizen rights are protected in <country of test> (61%). The lowest percentages were for political issues and events in other countries (52%) and how to contribute to solving problems in the <local FRPPXQLW\!  6LJQLÄFDQWGLIIHUHQFHVHPHUJHGDFURVVWKHFRXQWULHVIRUDOOVL[WRSLFV VHH7DEOH 6.16), suggesting that students in different countries experience different degrees of emphasis on the civic-related topics they study at school. Table 6.16 also shows the national average scale scores for studentsâ learning of civic issues at school. Countries with the highest national average scale scores (three or more points above the ICCS 2016 average) were Chinese Taipei, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Peru. Those with the lowest national averages were Belgium (Flemish), Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands.

We also registered in most participating countries higher scale scores for students who anticipated completing a university degree. Here, the difference was two points on average across the participating countries. Students at or above Level B of civic knowledge scored higher than students below this level, with an ICCS average difference of three points."

The basic assumption herein is that the social web and Web 2.0 technologies allow scientists, on the one hand, to open up the research process and, on the other, to prepare the product of their research for interested non-experts (see Table 2). Accordingly, we recognize two different streams within the public school: The first is concerned with the accessibility of the research process (the production), the second with the comprehensibility of the research result (the product). Both streams involve the relationship between scientists and the public and define openness as a form of devotion to a wider audience. In the following section we will elaborate more on both streams in reference to relevant literature."

There is a 25.7 percent point difference in phone ownership between men and women in WHP compared with a 10.8 percent point difference in ENBP. Clearly, the relative social and economic status of women in the two provinces is reflected in phone ownership rates. These gender differences by provinces are also apparent in how the mobile phone is used and how frequently men and women make and receive calls and SMS messages. In matrilineal ENBP, women make and receive more calls than men, whereas in patrilineal WHP the reverse is the case and again the disparity between the genders is starker than in ENBP (Table 4). Similarly, in ENBP, women send more SMS messages than men and receive about the same number as men, while men from WHP send and receive more texts than women (Table 4). In summary, it seems that mobile phone technology is not yet contributing to a signiï¬cant erosion of the gender divide in WHP society. However, it is likely that mobile phone technology is empowering women by widening their social networks beyond their immediate communities by allowing them to maintain contact with relatives and friends living elsewhere. This is especially important for women in patrilineal societies when they move to the villages of their husbands and have limited contact with their natal relatives living elsewhere. It is also likely that the technology empowers women market sellers economically through, for example, enabling them to contact relatives in town to determine prices at local markets before committing to transporting garden produce to market. These beneï¬ts, of course, pertain more to women in accessible locations not far from urban markets who can respond quickly to such opportunities. Overall, however, when ENBP and WHP are compared it appears that the uptake and use of mobile phone technology reflects existing patterns of gender inequality. Women in matrilineal ENBP have much higher status in their society and this is reflected in their higher rate of mobile phone adoption and use relative to men, whereas in patrilineal WHP with an entrenched high level of gender inequity, men are clearly beneï¬ting far more from the new technology than women."

That failure still lies behind todayâs problems. When Japan was a developing country, the central government took the initiative in developing industries, which resulted in improved living standards of the people. Now Japan is one of the most advanced economies in the world, and the Japanese society is fully matured. Japan is now a âproblem-saddled advanced country.â We still do not see what Japan should become in the future nor which industries might help revitalize the economy and best position the country for a promising future. Today, advanced countries like Japan must proceed and plan for the future without a model example. We have no other choice than to clarify the issues, establish goals to solve them, and build an advanced society worthy of being called a role model for the world. This should be the right way for Japan to reconstruct itself. I believe that Japan has sufficient cutting-edge technology and cultural imagination to enable it to achieve its goals. New demand and a new economy will be created through seeking solutions to the complex problems that all advanced nations face in the twenty-first century.

Faced with radical herd losses, thousands of Turkana households have moved to Lake Turkanaâs western shoreline for ï¬shing and/or herding. This populationâlargely uncountedâis extremely vulnerable to loss of accessible Lake Turkana water, ï¬sheries resources, and lakeside grazing. The Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural plantations along the Omo would cause major shoreline retreat and eliminate the Omo Riverâs annual flood âpulseâ of fresh-water and nutrients into the lake. Major loss of ï¬sh reproductive habitat and ï¬sh stocks as well as potable water, along with desiccation of lakeside environments essential to livestock and people would result. As conditions worsen, a general movement of ï¬shing and ï¬shing/pastoral villages southward toward Fergusonâs Gulfâitself drying outâand around towns, in search of relief aid or survival opportunities, is likely. With no practical means of continued livelihood, hundreds of thousands of Turkana ï¬shers and pastoralists would face region wide hunger and conditions for disease epidemics. Cross-border conflict between these Turkana and their northern neighbors would sharply escalate, especially in the face of regional arms trafï¬cking. Northern and central Turkana protests and pleas for help have so far been ignored by the Kenyan government which continues to militarize the region."

Educational qualiï¬cations were grouped into three categories: low, mid, and high education, where low level of education is deï¬ned as pre-primary or primary level of education, and high refers to upper secondary level of education or above. For marital status, we distinguished between people who were âmarried or cohabitingâ, âdivorced, separated, or never marriedâ, or âwidowedâ. We decided to group the never married with those who are separated or divorced because the number of them with children is very low and it is possible that they used to live with a cohabiting partner. Preliminary analyses were also carried out considering marital history indicators such as the total number of marriages, binary indicators of previous widowhood and divorce, as well as the age at or the length of the latest marital disruption. All these indicators were not signiï¬cant; therefore, we present results on the marital status at the time of the interview only. Three geographical areas were considered (North, Centre, and South) based on the statistical partition proposed by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (www.istat.it). Wealth was measured using a dichotomised indicator of whether the respondent owned his or her house or not (regardless of whether they were mortgage-free). Similarly, economic resources were measured using a dichotomised indicator of whether the respondent perceived that their household was able to make ends meet with great difï¬culty or not. Employment history was measured by distinguishing between respondents who have/had ever done any paid work and those who never worked. As an additional control variable for the Italian familialistic context, we introduced in the model a variable measuring whether parents had weekly contact with their children. Our hypothesis was to test if family closeness buffers the association found between indicators of fertility histories and subjective health. No measures of previous health conditions were asked in the ISF, whereas SHARE collected several indicators of participantsâ recall of health in childhood (deï¬ned as by when respondents were born up to and including when they were 15 years old). In particular, we considered an indicator of early life poor health if respondents missed school for more than one month, whether they recall being conï¬ned to bed or home for more than one month, or whether they were in hospital for a month or more because of a health condition during childhood. Moreover, SHARE asks questions about the respondentsâ socio-economic conditions during childhood, and we considered two proxies of these conditions using information on whether the respondents were living with both natural parents at the age of 10, and whether they had enough books to ï¬ll one shelf or one or more bookcases in the household."

Realising that his crimes have been rumbled, Bernie hires a mobster to kill the two young men at a party he will host at his exclusive Long Island beach-house. However, instead the mobster has Bernie killed for having an affair with his wife. Excited about their weekend of partying at Bernieâs house, Larry and Richard arrive to find Bernie dead in his chair. Thus begins a black comedic narrative in which Bernieâs corpse retains its liveliness in many biological and social ways. Fearing that they will be suspected of Bernieâs murder, Larry and Richard delay informing the police. As Bernieâs house starts to fill up with partygoers they see that nobody realises that their quiet host, sitting on the couch in a pair of sunglasses, is actually dead. Rather, Bernieâs friends greet and kiss him, massage him, haggle with him, and treat him as a living person. Larry and Richard therefore decide to âpostponeâ Bernieâs death so that they might have a fun weekend. They respond to Bernieâs social liveliness by acting as his guardian, explaining to the others that he is drunk. Without ever being noticed, they carry him, move his limbs about, and speak for him when the need arises. It is quite remarkable how many social interactions the corpse has in the movie. Over the course of the weekend Bernie smokes, waves, and goes waterskiing; he is âmurderedâ a further two times by the mobster assassin (who comes to question his own sanity when Bernie wonât die); and even has sex with his mistress who visits the beach-house to find out why he had not been in touch. This prompts the immortal line: âThis guy gets laid more dead than I do alive!â. Even more remarkable is the fact that, despite the sweltering weather on Long Island, Bernieâs body does not decompose nor show any signs of rigor mortis. Weekend at Bernieâs demonstrates how forms of life and liveliness can continue beyond biological death if the person is still a part of social life. In this fantasy of death denial, the âwhenâ of Bernieâs death is not recognised by his friends and is pushed into a distant temporal horizon by the two young men so that they can enjoy themselves in his company. In an even more macabre turn of events, Bernieâs corpse is reanimatedâreally this timeâthrough voodoo magic in the sequel, Weekend at Bernieâs II (1993). In other words, corpses have power and social lives through their own actions/reactions and the actions/reactions or assumptions of living people."

This is necessary for robotic aircraft and other robotic vehicles. Airbags use an accelerometer that detects the rapid deceleration in the front-back direction that occurs when a car crashes. This causes an explosive expansion of the airbag. One can conceive of more applications for these components in cars. An accelerometer in the up-down direction can detect if the car has fallen into a pothole.

36,355,0.256,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"9.1 Introduction In late winter of 2007, biologists at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation encountered a macabre scene during their annual winter surveys of hibernating bats in caves and mines in northern New York State: heaps of dead bats piled on cave floors (Fig. 9.1) (Veilleux 2008). Bats were also seen flying out in the middle of winter onto the snowy landscape and the number of citizen reports of dead bats found in backyards was much higher than normal. A white fuzzy growth was observed on muzzles and wings of the few remaining live bats, which led to the name white-nose syndrome (WNS) (Veilleux 2008; Reeder and Turner 2008; Turner and Reeder 2009). WNS is now recognized as one of the most devastating wildlife epidemics in recorded history and has caused the death of millions of bats in eastern North America. The research and management response to WNS has been rapid and we know much more about WNS than when those first dead bats were observed in New York, although there is still a great deal about this wildlife disease that is yet to be resolved. The first evidence of WNS in North America is dated to a photograph taken by a caver at Howeâs Cave in 2006 (Turner and Reeder 2009). Howeâs Cave is a popular tourist attraction that receives hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, many of whom visit from other parts of the world. The white fuzzy growth visible on bats is caused by a pathogenic fungus, which was described as Geomyces destructans (Gargas et al. 2009; Blehert et al. 2009), but was recently re-named Pseudogymnoascus destructans after closer evaluation of its taxonomic allies (Minnis and Lindner 2013). The fungus infects the skin tissues, including the wings and tail membranes, and causes bats to arouse too frequently from torpor"

If blue energy is a key aspect of blue growth, which is in turn a key aspect of the EUâs Integrated Maritime Policy, why is it not given the same importance across all the EUâs policies and strategies? Thus, for example, in the Energy Union Package contained in the Commissionâs 2015 Communication concerning a Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, there is no specific section devoted to blue energy: in fact, it does not even deserve a mention,58 the principal focus being the diversification of supply as far as suppliers and transport routes are concerned in order to guarantee energy security. The most innovative vision of the future to appear in the document would appear to relate more to exploring the full potential of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rather than to renewable energies.59 In a similar vein, the 2015 concept paper Project in Support to the Development of Blue Economy and Integrated Maritime Policy in the Black Sea, referred to earlier, in reality revolves around promoting tourism.60 Much the same can be said of the most recent revision of the Black Sea Synergy, carried out in 2015 through the afore-mentioned Joint Staff Working Document, which also makes no mention whatsoever of blue energy and deals only with hydrocarbon deposits or recent and future gas pipeline projects.61 In light of all the above, the EU could do worse in the future than to turn the spotlight on renewable energies in the various sea basins, of which the Black Sea is one, and thus by extension on blue energy, in order to improve consistency between all its different actions and instruments. Another challenge that the EU can undoubtedly do much to help overcome is that of spatial planning, in order to plan when and where human activities take place at sea. Maritime spatial planning reduces conflicts, encourages investment, increases coordination not only between administrations in each country but also between countries and protects the environment by helping with the early identification of impact and opportunities for multiple use of space.62 After the adoption of the Directive on maritime spatial planning, Member States are obliged to establish"

Based on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) banking statistics and information on borrowers from US MMF holdings, it is revealed that in the run-up to the GFC, MMFs in the US were the base of the shadow banking system, recycling wholesale funding to US borrowers via the balance sheet capacity of banks, especially European banks. The amount owed by banks to US prime MMFsâbased on the top 10 prime MMFsârepresented $755 billion of the approximate $1.66 trillion total in prime MMF assets, classified by nationality of the borrowing bank (Fig. 2.2). US prime MMFs nearly bailed out completely from the European Union (EU) periphery as of the second half of 2011, as a snapshot of the dollar amounts by nationality of borrowing banks on 30 June 2011 makes clear (Fig. 2.3). How gross flows net out is shown in Fig. 2.4, which plots US gross capital flows by category. Positive quantities (and bars) indicate gross capital inflows (the increase in claims of foreigners on the US), while negative quantities indicate gross capital outflows (the increase in claims of US residents on foreigners). The gray-shaded bars indicate the increase in claims of official creditors on the US. This includes the increase in claims of the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) and other current account surplus economies. While official flows are large, private sector gross flows are larger still. The negative bars before 2008 indicate large outflows of capital from the US (principally through banks), which then re-enter the economy through purchases of nonTreasury securities. We can gain additional insights on the nature of the gross capital flows through the banking system by following interbank claims of foreign banks operating in the US."

255,233,0.253,Railway Ecology,"Conclusions Our results provide a ï¬rst picture of the avian response to the presence and operation of HSR trains. Although the observed trends are not particularly prominent and are diluted by seasonal and inter-annual variability, they are consistent with the notion that train circulation could be responsible for a decrease in bird abundance in the traversed area. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the presence of the HSR has led to a process of ruderalization characterized by the increased numbers of species taking advantage of the railway. Some bird species representative of open and agricultural areas were found to avoid the HSR, whereas species that use man-made structures were found to be attracted to it. In fact, we documented the active use of these new elements, mainly the embankments and the catenary, by birds. In addition, birds alter their flight patterns near the railway, including showing some avoidance of it. However, birds risk train collision because such avoidance is not complete. Moreover, the species that are most exposed to train collisions are those that respond favorably to the railway and use its associated"

214,390,0.251,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Different strategies can be used to better quantify the different types of uncertainty in climate model projections. One of the best, which can be used for quantifying all three types of uncertainty, is to run ensembles, or multiple simulations. These simulations are typically done to gauge one kind of uncertainty, but they can be appropriately mixed and matched to understand all three types of uncertainty. The use of ensembles is now also common in weather forecasting. Weather forecasting suffers from model uncertainty and especially initial condition uncertainty, but usually not scenario uncertainty as we have described it. However, sometimes external events such as ï¬re smoke can signiï¬cantly affect the weather. In weather forecasting, ensembles of a forecast model are typically run in parallel: multiple model runs at the same time. Then the spread of results of these parallel runs is analyzed. The simulations usually differ from each other by perturbing the initial conditions (slight variations in temperature, for example) and/or by altering the parameters in the model. Sometimes forecasters consult different models, creating another sort of ensemble. Altering initial conditions tests the initial condition"

This impaired the conclusion that the pitch of unresolved complex tones is based only on fine structure information. Second, when thinking about pitch perception of unresolved complex tones in terms of interaction between envelope and fine structure, it appears that the limitation of phase locking is probably much less critical than when thinking in terms of fine structure only. In fact, it seems clear that there is no need to encode every phases of the signal to encode the most intense phases located nearby an envelope maximum. This explains that the simulation can extract a periodicity related to pitch when the carrier frequency is over 10 kHz (Fig. 3)."

Since science can work on improving knowledge of phenomena, technology can provide modern tool to reduce the impact of disasters, children and adults education is the flywheel to provide the change. We present here two cases selected among the wide range of educational activities that we have tested and to which more than 2,000 students and adults have participated within a period of 12 years. They include learn-by-playing, hands-on, emotional-learning activities, open questions seminars, learning paths, curiosity-driven approaches, special venues and science outreach. Keywords"

The role of the facilitator is therefore markedly different in each case, either attending to the kind of thing being said (e.g., is it an evaluation or is it a description of detail?), with less attention on the content (Coles); or attending to the content of what is said (e.g., does it display awareness of the complexity of teaching and learning?), with less attention to issues around whether it is offered judgmentally or not (Chesnais and Horoks). It was clear from the Workshop that both ways of working have affordances and constraints. What has been powerful is sharing the detail of what we do as this has emerged for us as the only way of beginning to understand how each of us interprets the words we use to describe what we do."
10,104,0.248,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"et al. 2012; Bressers et al. 2013, 2015). The structural context influences the process not only through its direct contents, but also through its extent and coherence (Knoepfel et al. 2001, 2003; Bressers and Kuks 2004). The extent refers to the completeness of the regime. The coherence is the degree to which the various elements of the regime are strengthening rather than weakening each other. Regimes with an insufï¬cient extent are by deï¬nition weak as guardians of sustainable use of water resources, while some relevant parts of the domain go unregulated. Most of the time, growing complexity is an answer to real needs and developments. As a matter of fact, societies in modern times have generally grown into a situation of increased complexity. Increased populations, borders, overlaps, activities, rivalries, etc. are a fact of our current living environments. A growing complexity in governance can be viewed as a logical adaptation to that development (Gerrits 2008; Teisman et al. 2009). Many external change agents, such as technological developments, add new scales, new actors, new problem perceptions, new instruments, and new responsibilities to the existing ones. The essence of extent is not the number of involved scales, actors, perceptions, instruments and resources as such, but rather the degree to which these are complete in reflecting what is relevant for the policy or project. In that sense it should not be mistaken for another way of making a descriptive inventory like with the descriptive questions. By coherence we mean the following: When more than one layer of government is dealing with the same natural resource (as is often the case), then coherence means inter alia that the activities of these layers of government are recognised as mutually dependent and influencing each otherâsâ effects. Likewise if more than one scale is relevant the interaction effects between those scales should be considered. When more than one actor (stakeholder) is involved in the policy, coherence means that there is a substantial degree of interaction in the policy network, and preferably productive interaction providing coordination capacity. When more than one use or user is causing the problem of unsustainable resource use for example, coherence means that the various resulting objectives are analysed in one framework so that deliberate choices can be made if and when goals and/or uses are conflicting. When the actors involved have problem perceptions that start from different angles, coherence means that they are capable of integrating these to such an extent that a common ground for productive deliberation on ambitions is created. The same holds for instrumental strategies that are used to attain the different objectives, as well as for the different instruments in a mix to attain one of these objectives. Coherence of the organisation of implementation means that responsibilities and resources of various persons or organisations that are to contribute to the application of the policy are co-ordinated, or these actors themselves are co-ordinated. In the implementation process, the additional fragmentation that is typical for complex but non coherent regimes will tend to lead to more discord between the actors (goals), more uncertainty (cognitions), and more stalemates (power) and, thereby, can hamper implementation. In the implementation process, coherence of the structural context (the regime) will tend to lead to less discord (due to more âwin-winââsolution creativity), less (subjective) uncertainty (due to more exchange of information and less distrust) and less stalemates (due to less possibilities for"

86,121,0.243,Nuclear Back-End and Transmutation Technology For Waste Disposal : Beyond The Fukushima Accident,"The accelerator is the driver of MYRRHA because it provides the high-energy protons that are used in the spallation target to create neutrons, which in turn feed the core. In the current design of MYRRHA, the machine must be able to provide a proton beam with energy of 600 MeV and an average beam current of 3.2 mA. The beam is delivered to the core in continuous wave (CW) mode. Once per second, the beam is shut off for 200 Î¼s so that accurate on-line measurements and monitoring of the subcriticality of the reactor can take place. The beam is delivered to the core from above through a beam window. Accelerator availability is a crucial issue for the operation of the ADS. A high availability is expressed by a long mean time between failure (MTBF), which is commonly obtained by a combination of overdesign and redundancy. In addition to these two strategies, fault tolerance must be implemented to obtain the required MTBF. Fault tolerance will allow the accelerator to recover the beam within a beam trip duration tolerance after failure of a single component. In the MYRRHA case, the beam trip duration tolerance is 3 s. Within an operational period of MYRRHA, the number of allowed beam trips exceeding 3 s must remain under 10. Shorter beam trips are allowed without limitations. The combination of redundancy and fault tolerance should allow obtaining a MTBF value in excess of 250 h."
356,362,0.243,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Lessons Learned Given the length of the iTEC project (4 years), it was inevitable that priorities changed, both as a result of internal and external drivers. Furthermore, the design of the project with five overlapping cycles of development, piloting and evaluation created challenges. For example, before Cycle 1 had been evaluated, Cycle 2 was at its midpoint and Cycle 3 had already begun. While formative data were shared with relevant stakeholders in iTEC, the extent to which the evaluation findings were able to input into the development of the project was more limited than might otherwise have been the case. Future large-scale pilots should take this into account and ensure that feedback can be informative and useful. As with most evaluations, resource constraints were an issue. As the project developed, the number of themes and issues which needed to be covered in the evaluation extended, meaning additional tasks had to be added which had not been anticipated at the start of the project. Whilst adopting a responsive, flexible approach, it was not possible to evaluate all aspects of this complex project thoroughly. Whilst impossible to predict changes over time it would be helpful to prempt where possible and identify which aspects should be prioritised. Regular reviews of the aims and scope of the evaluation would be beneficial. A further tension was the need to evaluate both project processes and outcomes. Again, resource constraints meant at certain points, strategic decisions needed to be made about where resources would best be focused and this could be built into a review process from the outset."
119,328,0.241,Contemporary Issues in Human Rights Law : Europe and Asia,"pillars of economy, political-security and socio-cultural of ASEAN.â62 The deputy Secretary-General for ASEAN socio-cultural community, Alicia R. Bala, pointed out that âthe role of ASEAN Secretariat is critical in making gender mainstreaming as a standard practice in ASEANâs policies and programmes across the three pillars.â She then added that âbefore we are able to effectively stimulate gender mainstreaming strategy in ASEAN, we ï¬rst need to understand clearly the concept of gender equality and how gender mainstreaming strategy can be applied in our work.â63 With regard to speciï¬c initiatives and legal instruments adopted to promote womenâs rights, ASEAN established in 2010 the Commission on the promotion and protection of women and childrenâs rights (ACWC). The nature of the Commission is intergovernmental, being composed of two representatives from each ASEAN country. According to its terms of reference, its mandate is to promote âthe implementation of international instruments, ASEAN instruments and other instruments related to the rights of women and childrenâ (para. 5.1), and âto develop policies, programs and innovative strategies to promote and protect the rights of women and children to complement the building of the ASEAN Communityâ (para. 5.2). Despite acknowledging the importance of a cooperative approach to enhance women and childrenâs rights, the act recognises âthe primary responsibility to promote and protect the fundamental freedoms and rights of women and children rests with each Member Stateâ (para. 3.5). This clause seems to protect the position of countries, such as Brunei, that allow forms of discrimination against women based either on religion or on culture. The Commission presents an annual report to the ASEAN Ministers meeting on social welfare and development. The Commission has played a central role in promoting effective implementation of common issues in the CEDAW and in the 1989 Convention on the rights of the child, however it presents some weaknesses. The ï¬rst one concerns its composition: independent experts would better guarantee the promotion of womenâs rights, since there would be no influence on their activity by national governments. The second limit regards its mandate, which does not include either the elaboration of reports on each ASEAN or the analysis of individual complaints. Effective implementation of international provisions requires the possibility for individuals to obtain compensation for alleged violations of their rights.64 Whether the national system is weak in that respect, a regional independent mechanism could help in pursuing the promotion of human rights. The ACWC drafted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and Violence against Children in ASEAN, which was then adopted by the"

According to âVideo Game Revenue Forecast: 2017-22â, it is expected that the global market of video games will grow up to $174 billion by 2022 [1]. Traditionally, computer games are downloaded from the Internet and installed on a PC or other end user device allowing players to run the corresponding game. With game sizes running into multiple gigabytes, the installation process may take the order of hours, with perhaps additional time required to install patches of new game versions. Furthermore, when players wish to play newly released games, they may require a higher speciï¬ed hardware conï¬guration to enable all the visual effects, and so they have to upgrade their computers to meet the particular speciï¬cation. Both of these factors can result in frustration and may result in gamers give up the game [2]. Â© The Author(s) 2018 I. Ganchev et al.

73,801,0.24,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The strategy adopted for the Nahr Beirut Rive project aimed to formulate a process that starting from the peri-urban is integrated into the urban structure connecting the existing open spaces, in a game of interaction between small and larger scale, and setting the conditions for the implementation of green infrastructure (Figs. 29.4 and 29.5). Only 3 % of Beirutâs surface area is allocated for parks, a percentage that is far below the World Health Organizationâs recommendations. This 3 % includes playgrounds and urban forests and represents 0.8 m2 per resident. In order to reduce marginalised pockets and social disparity and in order to pave the way for new immigrants to integrate more easily, we used the park as a ï¬exible relational device between natural and artiï¬cial materials, processes, parts of the city and parts of the campaign. We divided the peri-urban area into three sections: the Narh Beirut river banks, the residential neighborhood of Haddat and the industrial/airport area of Hay al Selloum and we chose the river land as an area of intervention. The river has become an appetising object of attraction for future development, gentriï¬cation, and delocalisation of exiting activities and inhabitants and, we felt, necessary to our contribution in terms of research project. In 1968 the Nahr Beirut River was converted from a perennial river to a concrete canal and eventually mutated into an open sewer. The highway built on its right bank completed this conversion into an infrastructural conduit of sewage and transport (Frem 2009)."

However, the gap between agile and non-agile firms and farms will be exacerbated. Finally, public research will be needed to support development and dissemination of technologies to adapt to, mitigate and slow migrating weather impacts. One possible outcome is migration of crop production associated with specific weather. For example, production of certain dry wine varieties requires specific weather patterns. Increased heat may increase sugar content and may harm the ability to maintain wine quality. One solution may be to relocate production of grapes to another region (e.g. from California to Oregon). The production of wine also involves processing and shipping of grapes by wineries. Wineries have invested a lot in infrastructure and have recognized brand names. For instance, some of the reputation of wine is location-specific (e.g. high quality Bordeaux wine is produced only in Bordeaux). Thus, migration of weather may lead to migration of infrastructure and changes in regional and brand reputation, but also provide opportunities for other brands to grow or shift. This will be a special challenge for denomination by locality/terroir, for example of cheeses and wines. Response by growers will vary. Growers in areas with warming weather may adapt their practices on-site to maintain location and quality, while other growers will shift location (such as wine production moving from Napa to Oregon). Further, with a migration of supply location, there may be a decline in terroir branding and a shift to marketing by variety (e.g., Cabernet) rather than by region, and an increasing importance of brand rather than location. This can induce further concentration in formerly location-bound industries as companies with good R&D, branding and scale make alliances with growers in developing countries for contracted production of intermediate inputs based on detailed specifications. Of course to some extent this already occurs in commodity olive oil or wine, such as with Italian producers buying olives and grapes, first processed, from Eastern Europe and North Africa. This is also part of a larger trend where food industry companies source commodities (cheap bulk intermediate inputs) and market differentiated products, such as Smithfield Foods does in Europe by sourcing cheap pork from Eastern Europe and marketing quality branded products in France and Spain. Large organizations that are aware of the differential impact of weather patterns that worsen productivity of certain regions (e.g. southern China), while increasing it in other regions (e.g. northern China), may invest and hold land resources to later build infrastructure for new agricultural production. Such behavior requires the ability to predict spatial differences in the evolution of climate change over time; that ability is still limited. However, as our understanding of patterns of climate change develop, we are likely to see more speculative investments in regions that may benefit from climate change. For instance, the projected water depletion/shortage in the Middle East is leading investors from those countries to buy land swaths in well-watered regions, such as in sub-humid Africa. Given technological change in agricultural production processing and transport, weather migration may prompt more rapid transition to a modernized agricultural system as older facilities are retired. In this case, adaptation to climate change will"

It is closely related to software development lifecycle. More abstract (informal) concepts mature into concrete formal state. From certain point, there is homomorphic mapping between elements of development artifacts (class models, sources) downstream of the lifecycle (e.g. design level class may map 1:1 to implementation class model). However the level of detailed ness and formalization rises as it approaches implementation. Pattern instances can be also transformed (mapped) through the lifecycle. In current practice, patterns that are instantiated at any point of the software lifecycle, pass only implicit pattern instance to subsequent stages of the cycle. Explicit pattern instance if any doesn't pass to later stages. For example patterns are instantiated in the design model of the software and code is generated from participating classes. But code generator, virtually, takes only the implicit pattern information into account -valuable explicit information created with CASE tool is lost and/or incomprehensible for code generator. It would be beneficial to have persistent pattern instance through the software lifecycle (e.g. it could enhance code generation). However standardize carrier of the pattern instance data has to be employed.

The Communication was adopted in 2008, after review. In the document, the Commission identiï¬ed policy areas to address movement towards a water-efï¬cient economy. The 2007 Communication offers a variety of technical and political initiatives to mitigate the impacts of water scarcity and drought (Estrela and Vargas 2012). As part of the policy, the 2007 Communication put forth an initial set of policy options to address the challenges related to water scarcity and drought, with special emphasis on pricing, land use planning and water-saving (Kampragou et al. 2011). The 2007 Communication also sets out a number of policy options addressing to increased drought frequencies as a result of climate change (Quevauviller 2014). The Communication also indicated the need for prioritization of drought risk management plans, the expansion of the European Drought Observatory, and a more rigorous use of the EU Solidarity Fund (Kampragou et al. 2011). The 2007 Communication on Water Scarcity and Droughts also address water pricing policies, advocating for âputting the right price tag on waterâ, âallocating water more efï¬cientlyâ and âfostering water efï¬cient technologies and practicesâ.

359,263,0.236,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Dynamics of the Brain","Computers A decade or two ago, the idea that an inestimable number of simultaneous non-linear equations could represent a theory of brain organization, if dreamt of by a few, seemed such an unlikely proposition that it merited no more than a passing frisson. There were two fundamental problems: how to make the calculations, and how to amass the data on which to make them. The first problem is largely solved, at least in principle and partly in practice. The most powerful super-computers currently available are at the peta-flop level (http://www.top500.org/list/2013/06/). The IBM roadmap predicts the production of an exascale computer around 2018 (1  1018 flops/s). Extrapolating todayâs Blue Brain Project numbers, exascale is probably the minimum required to simulate the entire brain. This level of performance is just sufficient for the simultaneous computation of the present estimate of the number of equations needed to provide a first holistic version of a brain model, one that instantiates the nonlinear interactions that give rise to the emergent properties of living brains. As to data storage, this is a practical problem that has effectively been solved by cloud computing and distributed storage with appropriate addressing; it is data analysis and aggregation with efficient database queries that are challenges at this scale."

Few approaches have been proposed to solve the SFC composition stage so far. Mehraghdam et al. [7] formulate a context-free language for formalizing chaining requests. They propose a greedy heuristic that tries to minimize the total data rate of the resulting chain by composing first the VNF that reduces the data rate of the flows in each step. Recently, Beck and Botero [1] proposed a scalable recursive heuristic that, at each step, composes a VNF in the service chain and, at the same time, embeds it in the substrate network (SN) trying to rapidly find a feasible solution. Most of the existing NFV-RA approaches deal just with the embedding stage as they consider the VNF-FG as a given input of the problem [5]. For instance, Bari et al. [4] propose exact Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic based approaches trying to minimize the OPEX caused by the SFC embedding. Also, Elias et al. [3] formulate the SFC embedding as a non-linear integer optimization model where the objective function is to minimize the network congestion. The aforementioned review shows that, up to now, little research has been performed in the composition stage of the SFC problem. Current solutions are heuristic-based and no optimal solution for the problem has been proposed so far. An optimal solution results in the best possible composition of the service chain with regard to a predefined objective. In this paper, we propose an optimal approach to solve the problem based on Integer Linear Programming."

241,634,0.234,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"10.3.2.4 Weather Generators Stochastic weather generators are statistical models producing high-resolution local-scale time series of a suite of elements such as temperature and precipitation among others, whose large-scale statistics follow the required criteria (Richardson 1981; Wilks and Wilby 1999; Olsson et al. 2009; Willems and Vrac 2011). Among many applications, they can serve as a computationally effective tool to produce site-speciï¬c data sets at the required time resolution (Semenov et al. 1998). The distribution used is usually different for different climate variables. For temperature, the normal distribution is the most popular (Semenov et al. 1998). More complicated is the generation of precipitation data, and different functions are used. Among the most popular are the Markov chain, the semi-empirical, and the NeymanâScott rectangular pulse (NSRP) weather generator. In the Markov chain generator, precipitation occurrence and totals are produced separately (Sunyer et al. 2012). Two states are possible: wet or dry days. The amount of precipitation on a rainy (wet) day is most often generated using a gamma or exponential distribution (Benestad 2007). In the semi-empirical generator, a few distributions can be deï¬ned, for instance for wet and dry spell lengths and precipitation amount. In the NSRP weather generator, Kilsby et al. (2007) proposed four different steps. A storm origin is described by the Poisson process. Separate rain cells within a storm are separated by time intervals taken from exponential distribution. The duration and intensity of each rain cell are also described by exponential distributions, and their sum gives a rainfall total. Weather generators can be used when the observation records are relatively short. They can also supply many weather ârealisationsâ having the same overall statistics. A wide suite of statistics can be used to ï¬t the model: mean, variance, skewness, autocorrelation, and many others. Weather generators can also serve to produce data for locations where there is information about the statistical distribution and time structure. For places with only short records of high-temporal-resolution data but longer series with data of low resolution, it is possible to use information from the longer records to make inferences about the distributions, and it is in principle possible to produce projections for temporal scales higher than those usually produced by RCMs (6 h). 10.3.2.5 Randomisation Models generally underestimate the local-scale variance. To resolve this, Karl et al. (1990) proposed the use of a scaling factor to ensure that the variance of the projected surface values will match the observed variance. But this could"

Cities became conglomerates of the exchange of goods and public events. The impressive growth of cities over time, especially over the last few decades, shows how much time the local executives had to spend developing the ï¬rst and second infrastructural layers of their regions. In the following videos, one can get an idea of the expansion of such places, which now house many millions of residents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WGPvWPpey8&list=PLzYZm159uzQNc7H 5UCCXHx4c4TKdCeaNt. The combination of an influx of people and the mentality of survival in an era of greed for those who had to deal with the cityâs ï¬nancial reality made cities a hotspot of vulnerability, pollution and all sorts of illegal (and legal) criminality. The need for regulation and control was already visible in the early 19th century, but became even stronger when the consequences developed exponentially. With regulation and control, we see government grow in the responsibility and costs needed to address both infrastructure and behavior at the same time. Level 3 (Smart City) hence became an instrument for government ofï¬cials to further extend their control systems and try to let technology help in planning the cityâs short- and long-term evolution. Cities had become very vulnerable due to their dependence on resources from outside the city itself that were only accessible through the power of the concentration of wholesale and the availability of money. Basic needs such as food, water, building resources, energy supplies, etc., all became economized, while jobs in the city mainly related to the distribution of goods, semi-government (education, police, health care, maintenance, infrastructure, control) and real estate. Increasingly, people were entertained with events and kept docile through social securities. At the same time, in many large cities, sub-communities developed within the chaos of poverty, greed and indifference, forming ghettos and social inequality. Financially, a city needs huge amounts of money to develop, and this money comes from taxes, government services, sales of property, etc. But this is often not enough, and ï¬nancial debt grows exponentially. Speculation develops into inflation, which becomes known as the economy of growth. This growth can then be taxed again, giving the relative impression that the city is getting richer, but at the same time, both the costs of society and moral (and real) poverty rise even faster. In reality, the region gets poorer and poorer, but the story is told differently by political and economic interests. It ï¬nally becomes important for the city that responsibilities be shared. In Eindhoven, after the recognition of vulnerability due to the dependence on large industries that had moved into low wage areas, the idea of the Triple Helix developed. The Triple Helix involves the three pillars of the old money-driven society: government, education and business development. These enter into cooperation in an attempt to optimize local resources, develop innovations together and implement Smart technological solutions to manage the city effectively. The human being is still out of the picture, as real estate, speculation and technology prevail."

118,648,0.23,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"19.7 Regarding Public Communication as a Form of Professionalism Because nuclear engineering is fundamentally based on the integration of the technical with the institutional, and based on interpretation of discussions at the Summer School by the both the third generation and expert lecturers, in terms of professional responsibilities, routine communication with the public by nuclear engineers must be improved. This problem is derived directly from this absence of âface to faceâ interaction of the nuclear engineer with the âclientâ. In terms of general communication issues, some nuclear engineering topics may be reported in the news, but these are usually when accidents, or potential accidents, occur. This is not a condemnation of the media and reporting practices. Most of the daily news is largely negative in terms of subject matter. Nuclear engineering is one of the subjects that suffers probably more than others, due to historical inertia, in that it is perceived mostly negatively normally. When accidents occur, this usually reinforces the negative public opinion. Conveying accurate information regarding nuclear engineering issues is also very difficult even for those trained in the profession, and further underscores the need for the nuclear engineer to realize that part of the professional responsibility involves public communication. As an example, based on first-hand observation, in the weeks following the Fukushima Daiichi accident, news crews from ABC, NBC, and CBS frequently interviewed the faculty Department of Nuclear Engineering at UC-Berkeley for technical communication about the accident and related events [6]. However, even this level of communication flows only in one direction, as the nuclear engineer basically just tells the interviewer the state of the subject at hand. This is needed and it is important to do, but a deeper level of public interaction is required, where both the nuclear engineering professional and the public can see one another as both part of the society. Therefore, without regular and direct interaction, or failing to realize that the profession must include some level of this, is an encroachment on professional responsibilities. This is not to place the âburden of proofâ on the public to motivate themselves to hold a more positive attitude regarding nuclear engineering; indeed, this burden is part of the professional responsibility of the third generation nuclear engineer to develop ways that public interaction can be increased. Meaningful public interaction has been a challenge since the inception of nuclear engineering and drawbacks to this are related to its historical inertia. This has led many times to an âus versus themâ mentality which only fosters antagonism. This has historically shown to be the wrong approach. This can occur when"

Da die meisten Schreibenden auf diesem Portal offensichtlich bereits Ã¼ber mehr Wissen in Bezug auf die Technologie verfÃ¼gen als ânormaleâ Medienrezipienten, kann vermutet werden, dass mit dem Fortschreiten der Ã¶ffentlichen Debatte zum autonomen Fahren (die ja erst im Laufe der letzten zwei Jahre an Fahrt aufgenommen hat) solche Themen an Relevanz gewinnen werden, die nicht nur die Technologie an sich betreffen, sondern auch ihre Einbettung in das System, also stÃ¤rker den Akzeptanzkontext einbeziehen. Insgesamt spannt die Untersuchung den derzeit gÃ¼ltigen âAkzeptanzraumâ zum Thema autonomes Fahren auf. Dieser Akzeptanzraum ergibt sich aus den Themen, die aktuell die Ã¼ber die Medien gefÃ¼hrte Debatte in der Gesellschaft strukturieren und gleichzeitig mit spezifischen Wertungen verbunden sind.

In ï¬ve countries (Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia), subsidies were targeted to either the poor or priority crops and reached a large proportion of farmers. For example, about 65 % of farm households in Malawi beneï¬ted from the subsidy program (Druilhe and Barreiro-HurlÃ© 2012). Likewise, about 95 % of the 2.7 million rural households in Kenya beneï¬ted from the subsidy program that targeted the universally grown maize crop (KNBS 2014). The number of farmers reached in the subsidies that were not targeted is unknown in most countries reported in Table 9.2. However, in cases where the number of farmers reached was known, beneï¬ciaries of the universal subsidies was signiï¬cantly smaller than the case of targeted subsidy programs (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). Investment in input subsidies as share of agricultural budget ranged from 11 % in Burkina Faso to as high as 59 % in Malawi (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). In most cases, government budget covered the entire or largest share of subsidy budget (Druilhe and Barreiro-HurlÃ© 2012) due to the previous donorâs negative perception towards subsidies (Kelly et al. 2011). As shown in Fig. 9.5, the large share of agricultural budget on subsidies has crowded out investment into other essential rural servicesâ such as market infrastructure, extension services, and development of private input markets (Ricker-Gilbert et al. 2013). Jayne and Rashid (2013) also show that the cost of input subsidy is greater than its beneï¬ts and that investment into R&D and rural infrastructure would provide higher returns to agricultural growth and poverty reduction."

169,217,0.228,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"that calculation of preference cannot take into account habitats that are not present in a stream and that occupancy/non-occupancy of low-availability habitat may significantly alter calculated preference. However, so long as care is taken not to undertake surveys on rivers with low physical diversity, calculation of preference provides the best way of removing the complicating problem of differing habitat availability between sites. Univariate preference curves can be derived using a number of ratio formula or preference indices. The simplest is a ratio where preference (P) Â¼ use (U)/availability (A). The preference functions can be delimited to take account of time of day, seasonal, life history, and activity factors. When a physical habitat is described by more than one parameter, a combination of several preference curves has to be made. Several combinatory techniques can be chosen here, for example, to use the minimum value of each preference outcome or to use a mean or sum of all parameters or more elaborated statistical methods (see below). Multidimensional statistical analyses for biological modeling Numerous habitat modeling studies have been undertaken over time in North America and Europe, ï¬rst mainly for salmonids (e.g., Northcote 1984; Shirvell 1989; Wollebaek et al. 2008; Moir and Pasternack 2010) but later for non-salmonids also (e.g., Melcher and Schmutz 2010). Predominantly these studies applied univariate habitat use and preference curves. In order to assess anthropogenic alterations on riverine systems, most attention was focused on morphological habitat attributes. It was recognized that functional processes in riverine environments depend on the interactions of many factors, such as ï¬ow velocity and/or riparian vegetation (Melcher and Schmutz 2010). As a result, a more sophisticated analytical toolset is required to quantify the biological consequences of impacted multi-metric environments and to assess ï¬sh habitat improvements in river activities. Multidimensional analyses are needed to better identify and understand habitat requirements (Melcher et al. 2012). Until now parametric methods such as classical variance, regression, or discriminant function analyses (Ahmadi-Nedushan et al. 2006) have been the main statistical methods used for habitat modeling. Due to their speciï¬c statistical presumptions and requirements, their use is frequently limited in comparison to nonparametric methods (e.g., CHAID tree). Logistic regression is a multiple regression model used in habitat modeling in the way that the probability of occurrence is regressed against a number of potential habitat characteristics. It requires ï¬eld observations of habitat characteristics available and utilized by indicator species. Habitat choice is described by the probability of a speciï¬c choice occurring along a habitat gradient. Using the stepwise procedure, all signiï¬cant parameters to describe the habitat are listed (Melcher et al. 2012). The result can be a map that shows the probability of ï¬sh occurrence for each location, each area, or each computational grid cell. The probability of occurrence can be converted to an HSI (habitat suitability index score). Classiï¬cation trees, often referred to as decision trees, predict the value of a discrete dependent variable with a ï¬nite set of values (called classes) from the values of a set of independent variables (called attributes), which may be either continuous or discrete (Breiman et al. 1984; Quinlan 1986).

70,278,0.227,Optics in Our Time,"as the focal point of the lens. The spherical aberration is schematically illustrated in . Fig. 6.11b . It is interesting to note that spherical aberration was ï¬rst noted by the Arab scientist, Ibn al-Haytham (d1040) in his magisterial work on optics, âKitab al-Manazerâ (see Chap. 7 2). Whilst this defect was known early on during the electron microscopy development, an effective resolution was only realised and proposed in 1997 (see [15] for a full account). Again, the effect of spherical aberration tends to be more obvious in the TEM case which, when corrected, allows one to resolve structures a small fraction of a nanometre. Its correction in the SEM is also equally important but only applicable in the top of the range instruments. This has in great part been due to the use of ï¬eld electron emitters, which has made it easier to reduce its effect in SEMs. . Figure 6.12 shows the effect of correcting spherical aberration in a modern TEM. Spherical aberration is an effect typically found in imaging instruments, such as cameras and telescopes. Its presence compromises the quality of the resulting image with potential catastrophe, as the scientists in charge of the Hubble telescope found [17]. The HST project cost several billion US dollars and took several years to complete. The ï¬rst images collected were of very poor quality, as shown in . Fig. 6.13a . The fault causing such a poor image was identiï¬ed to be due to spherical aberrations of one of the telescopeâs mirrors and a repair mission was launched to ï¬x it. It consisted of a number of astronauts, one of whom was an experienced experimental scientist who was able to walk in space to repair the fault. . Figure 6.13b shows the effect of correcting the spherical aberration on the quality of the images obtained. The SEM, on the other hand, has also seen a great deal of advancement to improve the quality of the obtained images as well as increasing its resolving power. This has largely been not only due to the use of Schottky and cold-ï¬eld electron emitters as electron sources, both having lower energy spread and much higher brightness than its conventional thermionic counterpart, but also due to a range of efï¬cient electron detectors that have recently been developed. As a result most modern SEMs offer high resolution imaging in the range of 1â2 nm. These ï¬eld emission sources have particularly beneï¬ted the use of low voltage imaging where most modern instruments operate down to few 100 eVs and sometimes even less to obtain an image resolution of the order of few nm.

78,283,0.226,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"environment and, what is more, spontaneous orders evolve through such informational complexity. Although, in his seminal book The Sciences of the Artificial (new ed. 1996), Herbert Simon used to warn that complexity is âtoo general a subject to have much content,â he pinpointed cases where this approach to the complexity of the subject matter can particularly be fruitful: âparticularly classes of complex systems possessing strong properties that provide a fulcrum for theorizing and generalizing can serve as the foci of attentionâ (Simon 1996, p. 181). Here, we can start appreciating how the complexity of ICTs-driven societies affects canonical tenets of legal and political thought, in four different ways. Figure 1 helps me illustrate this informational approach to the complexity of current legal systems. First, the idea of the law as a set of rules enforced through the menace of physical sanctions ( e.g., Kelsen 1949) often falls short in coping with the new legal and political challenges of the information revolution: identity thefts, spamming, phishing, viruses, and cyber attacks have increased over the past decade, regardless of harsh national laws like the US anti-spam act from 2003. Furthermore, a number of issues, such as national security, cyber-terrorism, availability of resources and connectivity, are systemic, that is, they concern the whole infrastructure and environment of todayâs ICTs-driven societies and, thus, these issues have to be tackled at international and transnational levels. Unsurprisingly, national law-making activism is short of breath, and this is why constitutional powers of national governments have been joinedâand even replacedâby the network of competences and institutions summarized by the idea of governance. Leaving aside how this profound transformation affects the sovereignty of national states, much as democratic processes and models of political legitimacy, attention should be drawn to how often the modern stateâs monopoly of power and legitimate violence is over in this context. National sovereign states, although still relevant, should be conceived as one of the agents in âthe formation and stewardship of the formal and informal rules that regulate the public realm,â that is, how Hyden, Court and Mease define the notion of governance (in Grindle 2005, p. 14). Second, the scenario of ICTs-driven societies appears increasingly complex since the quantity of information grows and its theoretical compression decreases (Chaitin 2005). To be fair, this trend is not new: some have summed it up with the very process through which pre-modern communities converted into industrial and ICTs-related societies, up to current post-industrial, or ICTs-driven, societies (di Robilant 1973). Others have traced this complexity back to the emergence of"
284,348,0.226,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction This chapter studies the emergence and spread of community consultations in large-scale metal mining projects in Latin America. These consultations are different from the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)-related consultations, or consulta previa, that are fostered by national governments. From Tambogrande (Peru) in June 2002 to Mataquescuintla (Guatemala) in November 2012, 68 consultations/referenda have been conducted in Peru, Argentina, Guatemala, Colombia and Peru. In all cases the result has been a large opposition to mining projects. This process is occurring in a context of growing pressures to extract mineral ores in Latin America and an increasing number of related socioenvironmental conï¬icts (see Chapter 2). The particularity of these consultations is that these are not commissioned by national governments as part of ofï¬cial procedures to consult communities but instead are promoted by environmental justice movements (EJMs), usually with the support of local governments. The emergence and spread of consultations in Latin America remains poorly studied. Studies addressing mining consultations/referenda have focused on the ï¬rst four cases: Tambogrande, Esquel, Sipakapa and Majaz/RÃ­o Blanco (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Subies et al., 2005; Haarstad and Floysand, 2007; De Echave et al., 2009; McGee, 2009; Walter and Martinez-Alier, 2010; Fulmer, 2011; Urkidi, 2011; Bebbington, 2012a); along with the wave of consultations in Guatemala (Holden and Jacobson, 2008; Rasch, 2012; Trentavizi and Cahuec, 2012)."

349,96,0.225,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"Remote Sensing Data Complete wall-to-wall LULC inventories are generally carried out using a combination of remote sensing data and ï¬eld-based sampling. Remotely sensed data come from aerial photography, satellite sensors, and airborne or satellite-based RADAR or LiDAR. Optical sensors are the most commonly used in LULC classiï¬cation as they provide spectral information in the visible and infrared bands at a range of resolutions and costs (Table 3.2). While ï¬ne (<5 m) or medium (10â60 m) resolution imagery are preferable for accurately monitoring LULC in landscapes dominated by smallholder agriculture, cost of acquisition and/or processing may be prohibitive for projects covering large areas. However, methods exist for nesting high-resolution sampling within coarser resolution wall-to-wall coverage to reduce uncertainty of LULC change analysis across large areas and lower costs (e.g., Achard et al. 2002; Jain et al. 2013). Image processing techniques can be applied to the remotely sensed data to enhance particular land-cover types, or enable more accurate stratiï¬cation and classiï¬cation, such as the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), developing textural variables (e.g., Castillo-Gonzalez 2009) or principle component analysis (PCA). Imagery can also be classiï¬ed into land-cover classes enabling easier manipulation in a GIS. Spatial analysis of remotely sensed data combined with environmental and/or socioeconomic variables can also create additional datasets to further enhance classiï¬cation and stratiï¬cation. Designating ecological or anthropogenic biomes (Ellis and Ramankutty 2008), calculating market accessibility (Chomitz and Gray 1996; Southworth et al. 2004) and identifying landscape mosaics (Messerli et al. 2009) are examples of such user-generated datasets to improve analysis of LULC change and explore drivers of change in smallholder landscapes."
16,444,0.223,"Autonomous Control For a Reliable internet of Services : Methods, Models, Approaches, Techniques, Algorithms, and Tools","OPSR determines how the computing and network resources should be utilized so to execute a DSP application with QoS requirements (e.g., response time, cost, availability). We observe that the application performance depends not only on computing resources, but also on network links that realize the communication among the computing nodes. This is especially true in geo-distributed environment (like Fog computing) and when Big Data have to be efficiently transmitted and processed. The strength of OPSR is the ability to jointly optimize (i.e., in a single stage) the selection of computing nodes and of network paths between each pair of selected computing nodes. We exemplify the problem using Fig. 4. We consider a simple DSP application that filters and forwards important events to a notification service within a limited time interval (i.e., it has QoS requirements on response time). The application comprises a pipeline of three operators: a data source o1 , a filter o2 , and a connector to the external notification service o3 . For the execution, OPSR has to identify computing and network resources from the available infrastructure that, in our example, comprises 4 processing nodes (ri with i â {1, . . . , 4}), 7 network devices (ni with i â {1, . . . , 7}), and 10 network links (li , with i â {1, . . . , 10}â observe that the network is not fully connected). To better show the problem at hand and reduce its complexity, we assume that each computing node ri can host at most one operator and that o1 and o3 have been already placed on r1 and r4 , respectively. Therefore, OPSR has to deploy only the filtering operator o2 selecting between two possible choices: r2 and r3 . Interestingly, the network control layer can expose different views of the network, so that the upper application layer can select the most suitable network characteristics for running its applications. In our example, we consider that the"
137,36,0.223,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"In recognizing and categorizing these responsibilities, it is also important to consider whether they have shifted across time between women and men, and how and why change has occurred or not. While all three responsibilities are, as Tronto (2013) argues, ânestedâ into one another, I will pull them apart for analytical purposes. With regard to emotional responsibilities, ample studies from diverse groups of fathers in a number of countries have found that men can and do take on this responsibility of attentiveness and responsiveness to children (e.g., Biblarz and Stacey 2010; Chesley 2011; Coltrane 1996; Doucet 2006; Doucet and Merla 2007; Goldberg 2012; Kaufman 2013; Marsiglio and Roy 2012; Rehel 2014; Wall 2014). Stay-at-home fathers and fathers on parental leave demonstrate how time at home alone with children is a critical pathway for shifting emotional responsibilities. As revealed in the chapters in this book, it is the hands-on practices of care that can lead to confident and competent caregivers. North American research has pointed to how fathersâ involvement in community responsibilities have also shifted over time, with men becoming more involved and accepted as primary caregivers in schools, community organizations, parenting programs, and the sites where adults and children cluster, and they have increasingly been accepted as the parent to take on responsibilities for connecting home, school, and community activities (Doucet 2006, 2013; see also Kaufman 2013; Marsiglio and Roy 2012; Ranson 2013). In spite of these changes, I would argue that, even in stay-at-home-father families, women still take on much of the organizing, networking, and managing of childrenâs activities and lives (Doucet 2006, 2015; see also Lareau 2011). Part of this slow movement of change in community responsibilities relates, in turn, to how, in many countries, the community landscapes of parenting, especially with infants and pre-school children, are still female-dominated, by mothers and female caregivers. Across the past decade, my research has pointed to continuing challenges for men, where they can feel like misfits in what one father called âestrogen-filled worldsâ (Doucet 2006, 2013). In fact, with few exceptions, most of the stay-athome fathers I have interviewed have narrated at least one uncomfortable experience in community settings with children, especially in parentâinfant playgroups. One Canadian stay-at-home father, Bruno, told me in 2003, âItâs like a high school dance all over again: girls on one side, boys on the other.â Ten years later, Geoff, a laid-off factory worker and now stay-at-home father and part-time school bus driver, said, âI never felt like I belonged thereâ¦ I totally felt out of place. I felt like I was intruding on their sort of little world, and that I wasnât part of it.â In spite of these narrations of discomfort, it is also important to add that the âdad-in-the-playgroupâ narrative has shifted over the past decade. In some North American communities, more and more fathers in urban settings are joining these groups, either as members of female-dominated groups or as participants in fathering groups (Solomon 2014; Doucet 2013). Fathers in community spaces help to shift assumptions, and this is"

353,56,0.223,"Disability, Health and Human Development","Because of the broad set of potential factors influencing wellbeing in the human development model, policy responses to improve wellbeing may have several entry points: health deprivations (preventing health conditions and impairments, improving health in general), resources (enhancing access to goods and services), and structural factors (e.g., change of attitude or physical environment). This comes in contrast to the individual and social models, which is illustrated with the example of policy responses to the disability poverty association. In the disability and poverty discourse, where disability typically refers to impairment and poverty refers to low income or consumption, it is often noted that disability and poverty go hand in hand and their relationship is very often portrayed as a vicious circle, especially in the LMIC context. It has become part of the reasoned wisdom. âIt is a two-way relationshipâdisability adds to the risk of poverty and conditions of poverty increase the risk of disabilityâ (Elwan 1999, p. i). âThe result of the cycle of poverty and disability is that people with disabilities are usually among the poorest of the poorâ (DFID 2000, p. 2). This vicious circle has been proposed and is widely accepted as the explanation for why persons with impairments are more likely to be materially poorer than the rest of the population. In the context of Fig. 2.1, this vicious circle focuses on the reinforcing links between impairments (Box D) and one functioning (low income or consumption) (Box E). The policy prescription is to break the cycle for poverty to be reduced among persons with impairments. Which disability model is adopted to think about these disabilityâpoverty linkages largely predetermines the course of action to break the circle. The medical model predisposes the analyst to identify ways out of the circle through preventive care and the provision of assistive technology, medical care, and rehabilitation services to persons with impairments. The social model is set to point toward changes in the environment as ways out of the circle though the removal of barriers to economic participation in the environment, for instance by changing attitudes toward disability in the community, so that persons with impairments can find jobs. Interactional models such as the ICF or the human development model may point toward a mix of medical and social interventions and go beyond the false dichotomy of having to invest in prevention or inclusion interventions. The human development model can offer further insights. The conversion function explained above is of course very relevant here. It points toward the insufficiency of using income or assets to assess poverty."

319,84,0.222,"X-Ray Contrast Media : Overview, Use and Pharmaceutical Aspects","Interaction with medications To date, only a few interactions of CM for urography, angiography and CT with medications have been described in association with clinical use. Such interactions are extremely improble since these CM bind hardly at all to plasma proteins, cause no inhibition of enzymes, are not themselves subject to metabolism, and are not absorbed enterally. In cancer patients treated with interleukin-2, more side-effects have been observed after administration of ionic and nonionic contrast media. These side-effects include fever, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, and diarrhea [66]. On the other hand, butylscopolamine appears to have no influence on contrast medium tolerance [67]. Due to the risk of lactate acidosis it was originally recommended that treatment with biguanides (Glucophage, Metformin) should be withdrawn two days before administration of intravascular X-ray contrast media to avoid accumulation of the exclusively renally excreted Metformin should the contrast medium induce renal failure [68]. This risk would also be eliminated if biguanide therapy were withdrawn from after contrast medium administration until an effect on kidney function can be ruled out [69]. A variety of pharmaceutical substances were tested for their influence on acute tolerance of CM in animal experiments. Even here, interactions possibly of clinical relevance were rarely observed [70, 71]. In cardioangiography, there is a theoretical concern that the cardiodepressive effect of ionic CM caused by calcium binding will be intensified by calcium blockers (verapamil) [72]."

326,187,0.221,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","of an imperative to avoid collisions that follows from deontological frameworks such as Asimovâs laws coupled with a relative weighing of costs for mobility and traffic laws provides a reasonable starting point. Moving forward, Asimovâs laws raise another point worth considering. The Second Law requiring the robot to obey human commands cannot override the First Law. Thus the need to protect human life outweighs the priority given to human commands. All autonomous vehicles with which the authors are familiar have an emergency stop switch or âbig red buttonâ that returns control to the driver when desired. The existence of such a switch implies that human authority ultimately overrules the autonomous system since the driver can take control at any time. Placing the ultimate authority with the driver clearly conflicts with the priority given to obeying human commands in Asimovâs laws. This raises an interesting question: Is it ethical for an autonomous vehicle to return control to the human driver if the vehicle predicts that a collision with the potential for damage or injury is imminent? The situation is further complicated by the limitations of machine perception. The human and the vehicle will no doubt perceive the situation differently. The vehicle has the advantage of 360 degree sensing and likely a greater ability to perceive objects in the dark. The human has the advantage of being able to harness the power of the brain and experience to perceive and interpret the situation. In the event of a conflict between these two views in a dilemma situation, can the human take control at will? Is a human being â who has perhaps been attending to other tasks in the car besides driving â capable of gaining situational awareness quickly enough to make this decision and then apply the proper throttle, brake or steering commands to guide the car safely? The question of human override is essentially a deontological consideration; the ultimate authority must either lie with the machine or with the human. The choice is not obvious and both approaches, for instance, have been applied to automation and fly-by-wire systems in commercial aircraft. The ultimate answer for automated vehicles probably depends upon whether society comes to view these machines as simply more capable cars or robots with their own sense of agency and responsibility. If we expect the cars to bear the responsibility for their actions and make ethical decisions, we may need to be prepared to cede more control to them. Gaining the trust required to do that will no doubt require a certain transparency to their programmed priorities and a belief that the decisions made in critical situations are reasonable, ethical and acceptable to society."

231,1364,0.22,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Tourism is one of the most highly climate-sensitive economic sectors. Most of its main sub-sectors, including sun-and-beach tourism and nature-based tourism, play a major role in the North Sea region and are especially weatherâund climate-dependent. On top of that, most tourist activities in the North Sea region occur in the coastal zones which are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Climate acts as both a âpushâ and âpullâ factor in tourism. Climate-driven changes in tourism demand are hard to determine because the tourist decision-making process is also influenced by factors other than climate. Nevertheless, summer tourism in the North Sea region is expected to beneï¬t from rising temperatures (air and water), decreasing precipitation and longer seasons. Destinations can reduce the negative impacts of climate change on tourism by adapting to the changes. The tourist industry also contributes to climate change. Not only is the tourist industry affected by climate change, it also contributes to climate change itself. Therefore, mitigating the climate effects of tourism is largely the responsibility of politicians, the tourism industry and tourism supply. Despite some negative impacts, the overall consequences of climate change for tourism in the North Sea region are expected to be positive."

From these investigations, a systematic set of principles for managing the relationship between man and the environment was developed. In particular, principles of holism, symbiosis, circulation and self-reliance were emphasized (Wong and Bradshaw 2008). In successive phases, appropriate native species were selected, relevant communities from the pioneer to senior phase were built, and each phase of the food cycle was connected, to enable the forest or water system to become a self-maintaining, recycling, living ecosystem. Numerous restoration projects and studies have shown that near-natural restoration could provide ample ecological benefits and enhance environmental quality with minimal human maintenance and a small initial"
100,234,0.219,Migration in The Southern Balkans : From Ottoman Territory To Globalized Nation States,"light of this crisis, andâneedless to repeatâstigmatization by the host societies, the des-identification, that is, the effort to differentiate oneself from the rest of the (stigmatized) group, has been a highly practised option at least among immigrants in Greece. The absence of any physiognomic markers that would render their difference from the dominant society visible, together with their identity management, seems to have suggested the âsocial inconspicuousnessâ of the Albanian immigrants in Greece. Probably every Greek sought to distinguish her or his Albanian neighbours; but, outside this local scale of personal relations and close vicinity, the Albanians were collectively visible in very few cases. For Thessaloniki, the field of my study, the Albanians were distinctively perceptible as a different group only in the piazzas for job-seeking. Compared to their numeric weight in the cityâs population, however, this visibility can be considered negligible. As I have tried to demonstrate in this chapter, the Albaniansâ âsocial inconspicuousnessâ is reflected in the way in which their physical setting is contained within the Greek city. The remarkable absence of ethnic infrastructure and the dispersion of Albanian households throughout the city suggest the âspatial invisibilityâ of the most important immigrant population of Thessaloniki. As maintained in this chapter, despite their great numbers, Albanians do not reveal any visible trace of their ethnicity in the urban space. As such, apart from being socially inconspicuous, Albanians are also spatially âinvisibleâ. It is important to note, however, that both outside forces and the preferences of the migrant group may lead to residential dispersion. This latter is not a sign of weakening of the groupâs identity. Besides, it would be wrong to interpret the counter-practice of clustering as a refusal to integrate, while understanding the residential dispersion as an enthusiastic volition to inclusion. In its way, each option expresses a form of response appropriate to the circumstances created by the migration situation and from the specific resources available to each group of migrants in order to deal with the situation (Barou 2003, p. 263). In this respect, Albanian migrantsâ relative invisibility in Greece, and more particularly in Thessaloniki, reflects a specific adaptation strategy among other optionsâa strategy which is not, anyway, an option for all Albanians in Greece. Moreover, apart from representing the Albanian immigrantsâ adaptation to the conditions encountered in Greece, these strategies respond too to the process of adaptation of Albanians to the post-communist eraâmeaning the realities that emerged after the discovery of the outside world, namely Albaniaâs position in this latter and the questionings that have arisen on what it may mean to be Albanian. These strategies also make use of the cultural legacies of a more distant past. As such, I argue that the practices of inconspicuousness respond to a complex situation that draws on both the Greek context of reception and the Albanian background.

In several countries, initiatives are afoot to build a legal foundation to help broadening the road to a world of openly accessible scientific results. Just to name a few: â¢ In Great Britain, the minister for universities and science, David Willetts, strongly supports a shift to free access to academic research. The British government actually plans to Open Access to all publicly funded research by 2014 (cf. Willetts 2012). â¢ In the United States, an initiative called Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA) is on the way, requiring ââfree online public accessââ.5 â¢ In Germany, the Alliance of German Science Organizations is a strong supporter of an initiative for a change in German Copyright law which is supposed to secure a basic right for authors to publish their findings in accordance to the idea of providing scientists free access to information.6 Since the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI 2002)7 was inaugurated, a number of declarations of different bodies have paved the way. Indeed, the list of signatories of the ââBerlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanitiesââ8 read like a gazetteer of scientific institutions and organizations worldwide. Due to a series of follow-up conferences, the number of supporters of the Berlin Declaration is still growing.

141,133,0.217,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"Description Hierarchy. A multi-level hierarchy that describes a set of related entities at different levels of abstraction is called a multi-level description hierarchy. A description hierarchy can be much simpler than the related structure hierarchy provided the structure hierarchy is highly redundant. If a complex structure is completely un-redundant, then it is its own simplest description [32] (p. 221). We distinguish two types of descriptions, state descriptions and process descriptions. State descriptions describe the state of the world at the instant of observation. Process descriptions explain how a new state of the world unfolds as time progresses that is how the state transitions happen. A description of behavior is a process description. The classiï¬cation of entities in a description hierarchy is usually based on cognitive models of the observer and thus may be dependent on the subjective view of the observer. Moreover, depending on the purpose, different levels of description of the same physical structure can be introduced by the observer. For example, the thermodynamic description of the behavior of a gas is at a higher level of description than the statistical description of the same physical material and the choice among them may depend on the purpose of the description. If the redundancy of a structure is removed from its description hierarchy, then a signiï¬cant simpliï¬cation of the description can be realized (e.g., [32] p. 220). In case the elements of a hierarchy are constructs, i.e. non-material entities that are the product of the human mind, the assignment of the constructs to hierarchical levels always results in a description hierarchy, the organization of which is determined by the purpose of the observer. In many, but not in all cases, the description hierarchy of a structure follows the structure hierarchy. Control Hierarchy. In a control hierarchy the macro-level provides some constraints on the structure or behavior of the parts at the micro-level thus establishing a causal link from the macro level to the micro-level. Constraints restrict the behavior of things beyond the natural laws, which the things must always obey. In many, but not all cases, the control hierarchy follows the structure hierarchy. Ahl [1] (p. 107) provides the following example: The concept army denotes a structure hierarchy that consists of the soldiers of all ranks and contains them all. In contrast, a general at the top of an army (a military hierarchy) controls the soldiers, but does not contain them. In some cases, as the example of the military hierarchy above shows, the control constraints originate from outside, i.e. above the macro-level. In other cases, the control constraints have their origin in the whole, i.e. the collective behavior of the parts of the micro-level. It is this latter case that is relevant for the analysis of emergence. Many equivalent examples can be found in Distributed Computing when we have centralized or decentralized control and management. Since behavior (function plus time) is a concept that depends on the progression of time, there is a temporal dimension in control hierarchies that deal with behavior."
282,16,0.217,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"The Political Declaration of the WSSD in Johannesburg, which was so instrumental in promoting the concept of partnership by including it as an official, âtype IIâ, outcome of the summit, contains no more than the following: We recognize that sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As social partners, we will continue to work for stable partnerships with all major groups, respecting the independent, important roles of each of them. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002a, Â§ 26) The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation that was adopted along with the political declaration is slightly more detailed in that it specifies the involvement of âmajor groupsâ in partnerships. At the same time, it constricts the definition to include only cooperative arrangements focusing on policy implementation (rather than policy definition, for example) in the area of sustainable development. [T]he implementation should involve all relevant actors through partnerships, especially between Governments of the North and South, on the one hand, and between Governments and major groups, on the other, to achieve the widely shared goals of sustainable development. As reflected in the Monterrey Consensus, such partnerships are key to pursuing sustainable development in a globalizing world. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002b, Â§ 3) This definition of partnerships and the subsequent work of the UN are, however, based on a more detailed description of criteria for partnerships. The criteria were developed in the run-up to WSSD and endorsed in the decision of the eleventh meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Like the definition proposed here, they recognise partnerships as voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiatives. But they only focus on initiatives designed to contribute to the implementation of internationally agreed development goals and include a range of normative criteria, such as that partnerships should pursue an integrated approach to sustainable development, display a sectoral and geographical balance and be designed in a transparent and accountable manner.5 The WSSDâs focus on cooperation in order to achieve a public policy goal is echoed in the political science literature, for example, in BÃ¶rzel and Risse, who focus on partnerships that transcend national borders: Transnational PPPs [public-private partnerships] would then be institutionalized cooperative relationships between public actors (both governments"

98,161,0.216,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","For each of the roles played by TSOs, it is possible to infer a set of expected impacts at the individual, organizational, community and societal levels. Some of these impacts are likely to be distinctive (idiosyncratic) to TSOs, whereas other impacts can be common to those of other types of social actors. For example, if there were no TSE organizations with paid employment in social services funded by the governmentâsuch as institutions for elderly careâthere probably would be public and for-profit providers performing those services. This is not to say that the social impacts of for-profit or government organizations providing the same services would be identical to those resulting from third sector provision, as TSOs, because of their distinctive features, innovate services in numerous fields, serve a more needy clientele, deliver services at a more human scale, stay in the game when government funding declines and so on. Hence, it is possible to differentiate the âmainstreamâ contributions of these organizationsâthat is, what TSOs have in common with governmental and for-profit organizationsâfrom their distinctive contributionsâthat is, the functional features that are more characteristic, if not exclusive, to these organizations. Based on reviews of previous research, these functions and roles can be translated into five domains of impact (Simsa et al. 2014; Enjolras 2015a, b): â¢ Well-being and quality of life â¢ Innovation â¢ Civic engagement, empowerment, advocacy and community building â¢ Economic impacts â¢ Human resources impacts In the following section we will present some evidence of TSI based on analyses and reviews of research conducted by this project (on the basis of available data) related to the impact domains outlined above: civic engagement and advocacy; wellbeing and quality of life; human resources; and social innovation. However, as already stated, there are methodological problems related to previous research on impacts, and we address as far as possible these issues in our subsequent analysis."

We can show that v1 â â, which contradicts the fact that it lives on a (W âª â)-disjoint path. We can now prove the assertions A1 , A2 , A3 and A4 at the end of main. A1 is a direct consequence of I6 since at the end L = â. A1 implies that each vertex u has at most one observable in W : obs[u] if u â obs. A W -weakly deciding vertex would have two observables, thus WDG (W ) = â. A3 is a direct consequence of I5 . A4 can be deduced from A2 and Lemma 3 applied to A3 . This proves that at the end W = V â² âª WDG (V â² ). To prove the other post-condition, we must prove that if there are two nodes u, v such that obs[u] = v, then v â obsG (u, W ). By I4 , there is a path from u to v. Let w be the first element in W on this path. W âpath W âpath Then u ââââââ w. By A1 , obs[u] = w. Thus, w = v and u ââââââ v. This proves the second post-condition."
