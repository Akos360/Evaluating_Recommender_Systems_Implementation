70,1001,1.0,Optics in Our Time,"Although we have learned a lot we still lack the full picture. In particular, there is still no unique answer to the long-standing question: âWhat is a photon?â In the present essay we of course do not answer this deep question either but illuminate one important aspect of the photon that on ï¬rst sight looks very strange that is the wave-particle dualism. Indeed, according to the quantum theory of radiation the photon is a wave and a particle at the same time and their respective distinct features manifest themselves in countless phenomena. The double-slit experiment with individual photons is one of them. The ultimate goal of our article is to discuss a rather special double-slit experiment based on two entangled photons which seems to show simultaneously the wave and the particle nature of light. Such a behavior which is strictly forbidden by quantum theory and, in particular, by the principle of complementarity makes the photon even stranger. However, a closer look at the details of the light generation reveals that there is no violation of quantum mechanics, and in the words of G. Stein: â. . .suddenly it doesnât look strange at all.â"

Large numbers of leatherback sea turtles are captured each year in the Gulf as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. Hawksbills are the rarest of the five species of sea turtle that occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and their current abundance is only a fraction of historical levels because millions were killed for tortoiseshell (jewelry, combs, brushes, buttons, etc.) during the past 100 years. Significant threats to hawksbills include destruction of nesting habitat, their dependence on coral reefs (one of the worldâs most endangered ecosystems) for food and shelter, and the continued trade in hawksbill products. Impacts from bycatch in Gulf fisheries to hawksbill sea turtles are minimal. In summary, because sea turtles are difficult to study and since some species have been studied more than others, there are significant gaps in the data available by species, as well as by life stage. However, despite the data gaps and limitations associated with selected data sets"
337,24,0.257,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"science during environmental crises through two case studies â the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Sandy. Machlis et al. suggest that a research agenda which includes integration efforts needs to be developed for understanding and improving science during crisis. Friedrichs (Chap. 4) makes the case for modified Malthusian theories to ground the study of resource management through science integration. He contends that the main impediment to integration both between various social scientific disciplines and between the social and the physical sciences is a refusal of social scientists to appreciate how deeply the societal sphere is embedded in wider biophysical and social-ecological systems. The chapter begins with a classical Malthusian framework and gradually adds complexity to it, showing how its logical structure is reproduced by simple neo-Malthusian theories that have been developed to account for contemporary global challenges. He demonstrates the potential of more sophisticated neo-Malthusian models and modified Malthusian theories contributing to better science integration. Finucane et al. (Chap. 5) present a conceptual framework for analyzing socialecological models of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically they examine whether risks, and perceptions of risk, associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations in the context of Vietnam. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, they draw upon multiple social science theories and methods. Finucane et al. conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as emerging infectious disease and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Thus, they argue that integrated approaches are the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem. Esptein et al. (Chap. 6) use the social-ecological systems (SES) framework to study power. They explore the long-standing divide among social scientists regarding power and its effects on the sustainability of social-ecological systems. They argue that there has been little constructive interaction between power-centered and institution-centered approaches. The authors use the SES framework as a tool to confront interdisciplinary puzzles that bridges the gap between social and ecological research. The chapter outlines a systematic approach for integrating diverse conceptualizations of power with the SES framework and then applies this approach to study the relationship between power and social-ecological outcomes. The analysis suggests that the SES framework is a promising tool for social science integration, but also that important questions remain concerning the validity of classifications, measurement, and statistical tests. Manfredo et al. (Chap. 7) conclude Part II by making the case that increased integration of the human individual into dynamic, multi-level models is essential to understanding agency, innovation, and adaptation in social-ecological systems. They use the social-ecological systems framework introduced in the previous chapter as a starting point to examine how conservation science with a focus on the human individual â particularly the tradition of social science research known"
264,64,0.248,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"arriving on surf beaches come from more than one storm, and if we add two similar sine functions we get a curve with three peaks. Everyone has their own examplesâICMIâs Klein Project is a multilingual collection of contemporary mathematics written for teachers. It would be nice if the pleasure that we get from mathematics imbued the whole of mathematics education, but we know it does not. Why not? How do we manage to take the pleasure out of mathematics? This question underlies all that follows. Let me now return to Ubiratan DâAmbrosio. It is an honour to be following up Ubiratan DâAmbrosioâs thinking, so let me briefly, and with a broad brush-stroke, go over what he was on about. He questioned inequity within mathematics education in a very fundamental way, and gave us some models for working towards creating a fairer world through a mathematics education that really paid attention to social and cultural issues. Many, many people have worked very strongly in this area, and I do not intend to give a summary of the comprehensive work that has been done. In more recent years, Ubiratan DâAmbrosio started to talk about mathematics as a dorsal spine. I want to highlight this metaphor because it is a very nice way of thinking about what has happened. He sees mathematics as the dorsal spine of civilization, the basis of science and technology (DâAmbrosio, 2007, 2015). The trouble is that you may have a spine and skeleton on which an animal may be built, but that animal sometimes turns into a monster rather than a beautiful creature. This has happened within mathematics, and, I would argue, within mathematics education. DâAmbrosio suggests that our essential goals are responsible creativity and ethical citizenship. What he did was highlight the role of mathematics and mathematics education in achieving both of those goals. In other words, he was pointing us to the wider reasons for our work as mathematicians and mathematics educators. But how? How do we do this? What is it I am supposed to do to engender responsible creativity and ethical citizenship? When I walk up the steps and go into my ofï¬ce, what actions will I take? I can presumably do some things in the way I behave, but how do I help to engender appropriate actions in the students that I teach? How are we to build a beautiful creature and not a monster. I think that DâAmbrosioâs essential message is that we should reinstate cultural processes within mathematics education in order to build beautiful creatures. I wish to think about what other things we might do. To develop a basis for making possible actions more explicit I would like to invoke ecological systems theory, which was developed in the context of child development by Urie Bronfenbrenner in 1979, a couple of years after DâAmbrosio introduced the ethnomathematical approach. The two theories have some overlapping principles (Bronfenbrenner, 1992)."

Mortalities from speeding watercraft have been the highest overall source of mortality, but there is some indication that with greater education and enforcement, these are on the wane. Cold stress due to periodic shutdown of power plants used as refuges by manatees has also decreased in recent years, due to concerted human action. Many carcasses are too decomposed for accurate assessments of cause of death, and human causes are probably larger than indicated in Figure 13.61 and Table 13.26."

71,1409,0.224,Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides: Volume 1 ISDR-ICL Sendai Partnerships 2015-2025 (Volume 1.0),"Terraces, traditionally sustained by dry stonewalls, occupy about thirty percent of the territory of Liguria. If constantly maintained, they effectively contribute to slow down the natural slope erosion. When no longer managed, terraces may increase geomorphological risk along the slopes and, consequently, at the bottom of the valley (Brandolini et al. 2012). Bad weather such as flash rain worsen the background hazard causing severe damages and devastation across Italy and weight over the economy of a country that has to faces a large variety of disasters. Italy faces emergency but efforts on prevention are not enough to deal with the problem. Emergency often announced with âstate of alertâ, and results in schools closure to try minimize the number of people on the roads during heavy rain. In addition to damage to infrastructure and housing, bad weather also affects agriculture. According to Coldiretti (Italyâs largest agricultural association) heavy rain, overflown rivers and landslides will cost millions of euros to the agricultural sector due to land and crop damage. Farmland overflown with water, vegetables production and plants cultivation located near rivers registered the worst images. The terraced landscape is very common in the Ligurian region, covering about of the 30% of the territory. Agricultural terraces are sustained by dry stonewalls and reduce the slow down the natural slope erosion, but if no regularly maintained, can worst the risk of landslides and âdetritus flowâ. Since 1970 recurring floods affect Genoa where the Bisagno Stream catchment flows across the eastern part of city center. The most recent and tragic was in October 2014 (Faccini et al. 2016). The 5 Terre peculiarity of little towns cling to sheer hills along a narrow, rugged strip of land between the Maritime Alps, the Apennine Mountains and the Ligurian Sea is results into a heavy geo-hydrological risk. The fragile land conditions turn into instability during unusual meteorological conditions that causes heavy flooding. This happened in October 2011 when the river rushed violently down dislocating and destroying several towns, redeï¬ning the natural architecture of the affected the Vara and Magra Valleys near La Spezia (Piangiamore et al. 2015) (Figs. 2 and 3)."

The method is based on a glasshouse hydroponics test in which salt is added to the nutrient hydroponic solution in which the seedlings are grown. A list of equipment is provided including hydroponic hardware and stock solutions. Advice is given on seed storage prior to use and pregermination treatments that promote even germination of test samples. Salt treatments commence after seedling establishment in hydroponics, at the 2â3 leaf stage. Information on responses of standard genotypes (tolerant, intermediate and sensitive) is given to which test seedlings are compared. Visual symptoms of salinity stress include reduced leaf area, whitish appearance of lower leaves, leaf tip death, leaf rolling and seedling death. Scoring is carried out according to the standard evaluation system developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Recommended test salt concentrations are given along with a method to recover selected seedlings and examples of use."

193,145,0.215,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"The fact that Ukrainian migrants can transfer the money earned abroad personally without having to bear additional transfer costs is an advantage of temporary, especially circular, migration (Grotte 2012). However, qualitative studies on the remitting behaviour of Ukrainian migrants report negative examples of Ukrainian migrants being robbed on the way back to or upon arrival in Ukraine (Grotte 2012; Kindler 2011). A study conducted in Italy (Weber 2004) indicates that difficulty in re-negotiating social status when back in Ukraine may constitute a constraint on return, and rather a motivation to remain abroad longer than initially intended, going home only for short periods of time. This shows that the âstatus tensionsâ experienced by temporary migrants, as well as by their children, are strongly linked to their statuses in their countries of origin, which can impact not only temporal patterns of mobility but also the well-being of both migrants and their families. This also demonstrates that lowprestige work in the destination country does deprive migrants of their social status, partially challenging the claim put forward, for example, by the dual labour market theory of Piore (1979) that such deprivation should be lower or non-existent in the case of temporary migrants. This is due to the fact that the Ukrainian migrants studied had experienced tensions about their social position in the country of origin. The risk of deskilling or de-qualification is high for temporary Ukrainian migrants (see Triandafyllidou 2011; Caglar et al. 2011; Iglicka et al. 2011). The temporary migration of Ukrainian citizens is often related to temporary jobs that do not require high skills and belong to the so-called secondary sector of the labour market. Consequently, studies in a number of countries have found loss of skills among educated Ukrainian migrants performing low-skilled jobs (Antoniewski and KoryÅ 2002; Shakhno and Pool 2005; Fedyuk 2012). For example, a study based on two national surveys of foreigners in the Czech Republic provides evidence of a significant waste of human capital among Ukrainians (Leontiyeva 2014; see also Chap. 8). A crucial finding of this study is that migrants âwith permanent residence permits turned out to be twice as likely to have skilled jobs compared to those with temporary residence permits and were half as likely to end up on the bottom rungs of the labour marketâ (Leontiyeva 2014:74). This suggests that the temporal dimension of migration, related to legal status on the Czech labour market, intersects with the risk of deskilling among migrants, which tends to be higher for temporary migrants. Irregular stay means higher risks and consequently higher mobility costs between Ukraine and the country of migration (see Chap. 4). However, paradoxically, efforts to gain legal status, even temporary, or to take part in seasonal migrant worker programmes, may lead to negative financial and other consequences for migrants."
390,578,0.211,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"ur lives are full of repetition. We count the days through the natural rhythms of the rotation of the earth, the revolution of the moon around the earth, and of the earth around the sun. Each day is different, but our lives are often structured by standard routines that are similar from day to day. In a sense, repetition is also the essence of computing. Nobody needs a computer to add two numbers together. (Letâs hope not, anyway!) But adding a thousand or a million numbers together? Thatâs a job for a computer. This relationship of computing and repetition was obvious early on. In Ada Lovelaceâs famous 1843 discussion of Charles Babbageâs Analytical Engine, she wrote: Both for brevity and for distinctness, a recurring group is called a cycle. A cycle of operations, then, must be understood to signify any set of operations which is repeated more than once. It is equally a cycle, whether it be repeated twice only, or an indefinite number of times; for it is the fact of a repetition occurring at all that constitutes it such. In many cases of analysis there is a recurring group of one or more cycles; that is, a cycle of a cycle, or a cycle of cycles."

222,232,0.208,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The number of historical flood events from 1954 to 2014, categorised by extent, are shown in Table 8.1 (BWDB 2015). Extreme, dry and average flood years are defined by the national area flooded. Twenty-five per cent of all flood events occurred during extreme flood years and caused significant damage. Two typical examples of fluvial floods, one for an average flood condition (year 2000) and one for an extreme flood condition (year 1998), are shown in Fig. 8.2. The location of the discharge measurement stations are the entry points of the rivers into Bangladesh from India. The Brahmaputra water level starts rising from the early monsoon (JuneâJuly) and reaches its first peak in the third week of July. It then falls and rises again and, in an average flood year, attains its second peak in the first week of August. The Ganges has a single peak of flood level occurring in the second week of September. For the Upper Meghna, the first flood peak occurs in the second or third week of May, and, in an average flood year, a second peak occurs close to the second peak of the Brahmaputra. The effect of flow from the Upper Meghna on overall flooding is small as its discharge only represents ten per cent of the combined discharges of Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers (Islam et al. 2010). The different timing of the flood peaks of the major rivers are mainly due to variations in rainfall in the upper catchments and the travel time to reach the discharge measurement points considered. Synchronisation of the peaks across the three rivers is rare, but has occurred: the floods of 1988 and 1998 (see Fig. 8.2) being examples (Islam and Chowdhury 2002). During peak synchronisation, the second peak of the Brahmaputra is delayed or may occur as a third peak coinciding with the single peak of the Ganges. This triggers significant fluvial flooding in Bangladesh."
311,792,0.208,The Physics of the B Factories,"Their choice avoids unphysical singularities which are generated at q 2 = t+ by the outer function in a truncated BGL parameterization. Further, Bourrely, Caprini, and Lellouch (2009) optimize the parameter t0 such that the semileptonic domain is mapped onto a symmetric interval in z. With the choice t0 = (mB + mÏ )( mB â mÏ )2 , the value of |z| < 0.279. Although the BCL parameterization has a simpler functional form, the constraint on the series is more complicated than Eq. (17.1.50) in that it is no longer diagonal in the series index k. We use the BCL parameterization to obtain |Vub | in Section 17.1.4.3. A diï¬erent approach suggested by Flynn and Nieves (2007a,b) uses the OmneÌs parameterization, allowing one to express the form-factor shape in terms of the elastic BÏ scattering phase shift and the value of f+ (q 2 ) at a few subtraction points below the BÏ production threshold. Lattice QCD form-factor calculations State-of-the-art LQCD computations now regularly include the eï¬ects of three light dynamical quarks. Often calculations are done in the isospin limit with two lighter degenerate quarks and one heavier quark with a mass close to the physical strange quark; these are referred to as â2+1â ï¬avor simulations. In practice, limited computational resources prohibit calculations with simulated values of the u- and d-quark as light as those in the real world. LQCD calculations must also be done at ï¬xed, nonzero values of the lattice spacing. Hence one generates data with a sequence of light-quark masses (down to â¼ mstrange /10 for current B â Ï calculations) and a sequence of lattice spacings (down to a â¼ 0.09 fm for current B â Ï calculations) and extrapolates the remainder of the way to the physical masses and zero lattice spacing. Because these limits are interrelated, it is now standard to use model-independent functional forms derived in Chiral Perturbation Theory (ÏPT) for the speciï¬c lattice quark formulation being used (i.e. including discretization corrections) to guide the extrapolation (see, e.g., Aubin and Bernard, 2007, for the case of B â Ï).

TNF-Î± is an important molecule in mechanical loading force-induced osteoclast formation in the periodontal ligament during orthodontic tooth movement. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between TNF-Î±-induced osteoclast formation and the cytokines expressed during mechanical loading. Th1 cytokines inhibited osteoclast and odontoclast formation during mechanical loading in the periodontal ligament. There is a possibility that local injection of Th1 cytokines might be a useful tool to enhance the anchorage site and control the rate of tooth movement during orthodontic treatment, as well as prevent relapse after orthodontic treatment. Moreover, local injection of Th1 cytokines might be a useful tool in reducing root resorption, particularly for highrisk teeth. However, further studies are required to fully understand the relationship between mechanical loading-induced osteoclast formation and the effect of cytokines.

This is a change rate that in the long term has the potential of transforming the welfare model in Sweden. In Norway, there has also been an increase in for-proï¬t welfare from 61,000 full-time employees in 2006 to 84,500 in 2012. In Denmark, which has the smallest share of 7.1%, there has been a real growth from 38,000 to 44,000 full-time employees. At the moment, the public-sector employment share is almost the same in all three Scandinavian countries, between 78 and 79% of the welfare employment. However, it is decreasing rapidly in Sweden withâ 3.6% points in a 5-year average andâ1.5% points in Norway, but it is increasing by 0.5% points in Denmark. In Norway, the public sector is still growing in real numbers, from 429,000 full-time employees in 2006 to 500,000 in 2013. In Denmark, the public sector reached a maximum in 2010 with 549,000 full-time employees, and in Sweden it peaked in 2007 with 974,000 employees.3 Although the public-sector shares still may seem large in comparative perspective, they are decreasing in real numbers primarily as a result of for-proï¬t growth. This adds a new feature to the âsocial democratic modelâ, previously characterized by high public welfare spending and a small nonproï¬t sector. The public sector was preferred as a service provider to ensure unitary standards and equal access for all (Anheier and Salamon 2006; Salamon and Anheier 1998). For-proï¬t sector growth also sets the Scandinavian countries apart from the corporatist and liberal countries, which have much larger nonproï¬t sectors (Salamon et al. 2004). To sum up, in Sweden, the public-sector employment has decreased in real numbers, and a decline has recently started in Denmark too. In Norway, with no need for austerity measures, all three sectors still grow in real numbers, although the public sectorâs share decreases slightly. In all three Scandinavian countries, the for-proï¬t providers are increasing their shares of the welfare employment faster than the nonproï¬ts. The gap between the sectors is growing fastest in Sweden, where the nonproï¬ts remain very small while the for-proï¬t share has doubled. This has resulted in a dramatic shift from the public sector to the for-proï¬t sector"

158,1,0.196,Microfinance 3.0 : Reconciling Sustainability With Social Outreach and Responsible Delivery,"Fifteen years ago, microfinance was looked upon as one of the most promising concept to lift poor people out of poverty. Microfinance was perceived to be âgood per seâ. Many institutions proved successful both in development and in financial terms. Today, after an impressive pushing of the âfinancial frontierâ, financial inclusion seems to have a mixed record: While it is true that many people in developing countries still lack access to finance, we have also witnessed the opposite âtoo much/easy accessâ led to overindebted clients, unable to serve their several microcredits offered by (too) many institutions. In some markets, this implied a move into pure consumer lending, partly replacing the traditional lending to micro-entrepreneurs. âGoodâ responsible microfinance institutions were not able to continue to operate in these âcontaminated marketsâ. In this context, the question (re-)emerged: isnât it, after all, unrealistic to believe that pursuing a development mission can go hand in hand with financial success, particularly in the context of commercial microfinance? I do not share this view. In fact, I believe the two goals are intertwined in the sense that without financial viability, clients cannot be served in a sustainable way, and that institutions which do not understand their clients with their financial needs will hardly be financially successful. However, this does not happen automatically: on the contrary, it takes a lot of efforts to achieve both objectives: a high degree of professionalism and a strong commitment to a responsible service delivery. It also takes responsible regulators and more efforts to promote financial literacy of clients. This book is part of a publication series initiated by KfW on selected topics in the field of financial systems development, one of the core competencies of KfW. This edition addresses the ethics of financial systems development which have been under scrutiny in âdevelopedâ markets as well as in developing countries. As âbankingâ seems to have become a questionable activity, we will take a special look at the institutions that provide microfinance services. âMicrofinance 3.0â intends to provide a new âframeworkâ for the future of microfinance which builds upon past success stories as well as upon lessons learnt from bad practices and errors. It contains nine contributions, written by different microfinance experts, distinguished practitioners as well as observers and analysts of microfinance for more than a decade. Some of these contributions were presented at the KfW Financial Sector Symposium in late 2012 in Berlin, where the future landscape of microfinance was discussed. These contributions touch upon some of the âingredients of âmicrofinance 3.0â: the values needed to provide financial services responsibly, the appropriate busi-"

This was a period of innovation in mental health care across many developing countries, in which the WHO then sought out their guiding role. Following initial discussions on the organisation of mental health care, many of the psychiatrists who participated in regional and international conferences continued to seek out advocacy roles. In 1975, a more politically inclined Association of Psychiatrists in Africa changed its name to the Association of African Psychiatrists, reflecting both the increased number of indigenous-born psychiatrists on the continent as well as a desire for Observer status in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The notion of African psychiatrists having a unique perspective on the problems of mental illness in Africa was also reflected in the title of the Associationâs new African Journal of Psychiatry, of which Muhangi was Assistant Editor-in-Chief.74 In the longer term, however, African psychiatrists have contributed disproportionately little to research and policy within the field of international mental health. The Association of African Psychiatrists, along with its journal, collapsed in 1981 just as structural adjustment policies were starting to cripple health systems and universities, resulting in little time, funding and training for experiments or research. Reductions in travel allowances, combined with ongoing difficulties of staffing, have made it more difficult for psychiatrists to participate in conferences beyond national borders, and barriers to research and publication have resulted in relatively little research being published in international journals. While some psychiatrists continued to consult for the WHO, most did not, focusing on keeping psychiatry going within their own countries, often in difficult economic and political circumstances. Since the mid-1990s, most professional activity among psychiatrists has been limited to a regional sphere of influence. The Uganda Psychiatric Association has met for regular conferences since its formation in 1996. Psychiatrists in East Africa have met at annual scientific conferences since 1999, and a new and expanded African Association of Psychiatrists and Allied Professionals was formed in the early 2000s, starting with a meeting in Nairobi. Such activity, particularly since the early 2000s, suggests an important body of knowledge and experience that should play a central role in determining international, now global mental health policy, but which has nevertheless seen relatively little circulation outside of the continent.75"

By the end of the eighteenth century, however, ordinary people throughout Europe were far more likely to want to see suicide as the result of mental illness and to try to circumvent traditional, religious or legal requirements that suicides be denied normal burial.34 However, attitudes towards taking oneâs own life show considerable variation even in the eighteenth century and were affected by the circumstances of the suicide. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, suicide was considered a crime under both secular and canon law. Those who committed suicide in order to escape the justice of the State were double criminals. Since the means of death had been taken from the State, other forms of punishment were placed upon the suicide, foremost among which were post-mortem punishment of the body and forfeiture of the Estate. As Houston notes, forfeiture was âa token of blame and of âapologyââ, but the punishment of the body was both more shameful and more punitive.35 MacDonald and Murphyâs history of suicide records that the normal punishment for suicides until 1823 was forfeiture and profane burial. The 1823 Act ended the custom of profane burial for suicides, but it is noteworthy that profane burial was never a universal and legally enshrined rule: the 1823 act only put a stop to a local customary practice which had already fallen out of use in many parts of the country, as a more sympathetic attitude to suicides gained ground. In fact, Houston contends that profane burial in the form of highway burial with a stake through the body was predominantly a southeast English custom and that widely variable practices are described in provincial newspaper and legal accounts of the disposal of the suicideâs body. Houston notes, for example, that in 50 years of the Cumberland Pacquet only 3 of 18 suicides reported in the northern counties of England were linked to unusual burials: one staked at a crossroads, one on Lancaster Moor and one buried at Low Water mark. All three are from 1790â1791 and might 34 MacDonald and Murphy, Sleepless Souls. See also the essays in Jeffrey Watt (ed.)

We need to investigate methodologies for the accountability, because in the envisioned edge/fog computing environment, users can flexibly share their spare resources to host applications. The hybrid resource continuum from edge/fog to Cloud calls for studying dynamic pricing mechanisms, similar to the spot instance pricing from Amazon EC2 service2 . The ability of monitoring the elasticity of a system/application deployed in a large-scale, dispersed and multi-provider hybrid environment requires investigation. How to quantify and measure the elasticity of a complex distributed system? As regards elasticity, we can quantify its performance by considering the number of missing or superfluous adaptations over time, the durations in sub-optimal states, and the amount of over-/under-provisioned resources [35]. However, how to measure such quantities in a dispersed, large-scale environment with multiple providers turns out to be challenging. Similarly to Cloud computing, we need to identify (or develop) efficient business models that support and encourage the diffusion of trusted computing resources and the elasticity requirements for such business models. One of the most important challenge arises from the lack of central controlling authorities in the edge/fog computing environment, which makes it difficult to assert whether a device is hosting an application component. Security aspects are of key importance, because nowadays the value of data is very high and an infrastructure that does not guarantee stringent security properties will be hardly adopted. Similarly for the accountability issue, the decentralization of the emerging environment requires to deal with the lack of a central security authority. Sophisticated yet lightweight security mechanisms and policies should be introduced, so to create a disseminated trustworthy environment."

31,47,0.179,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Towards a Typology of Harms For reasons of analytical clarity it is worth distinguishing between different orders of harm. â¢ First order intrinsic harms, which causally affect living persons and not dead bodies. The dead body, by virtue of being a corpse is beyond experiencing intrinsic harm of any order. â¢ First and Second order symbolic harms are either harms to the interests of those who once existed (first order symbolic harms to antemortem persons), or they are biographical harms that occur after death and to a posthumous reputation (second order symbolic harms). The FeinbergâPitcher thesis considers the first, but not the second. First order symbolic harms accrue to the transcendent interests of ante-mortem persons. Second order symbolic harms are harrmful post-mortem re-figurations of what once living persons interests were thought to be. They can be thought of as harms to memory and biography. Posthumous harms, moreoverâ are not free-floating, they accrue to a living subject bearer, normally in the form of a relative or friend who is concerned that the memory of their dead is not misrepresented. The living are witness to the fidelity of memory and its rightful conservation. They are surrogate interest bearers for the transcendant interests of those now dead. â¢ Second order intrinsic harms are intrinsic harms to significant others who are related to or care about the deceased and experience the hurt of how they are disremembered. They tend to be psychological harms and rely in a narrative investment about how someone ought to be remembered. Being disremembered causes psychological distress in those that invest truth in a certain memorial narrative. Most commonly, it may be experienced by survivors who hear others âspeaking illâ of their dead relatives or friends. More dramatically it may be experienced by a relative as a deliberate and intentional attempt to dishonour the dead and even to refigure their memory as particularly notorious. Usually disremembering the dead is expressed through the spoken or written word when this is not what they deserved. Second order intrinsic harms can be experienced by others as harm to the corpse itself. While it is not possible to harm a mouldering corpse in itself, the corpse has a symbolic unity for the living that needs to be respected, in particular by those who grieve âtheirâ"

In the ï¬rst two project years, three different managers were in charge with different attitudes towards the project and its implementation. In certain periods, the project was overshadowed by the companyâs business issues, and its objectives were put to the background. While the company owner together with Mr. Supportive drove the project, some managers perceived the project rather being vague than closely related to the concrete business model of the company. This resulted in some discrepancies in management. The management installed during the evaluation decided to foster the project implementation, but simultaneously to focus on factory operation, as it pursued cost cutting and similar measures as part of its crisis management. Furthermore, the owner moved to the background, as his daughter became part of the new management team. 4.4.3.4 Takeaways from the Case Company A and the regional IT consultancy project partner analyzed the project implementation and identiï¬ed a list of experiences and events that have had impact on the project results. Undoubtedly, the project has created the unique opportunity for both partners to develop innovative solutions, and the project implementation will be deï¬nitely useful for different types of production companies. Selected lessons learnt are presented subsequently. Continuously discuss the project progress with relevant stakeholders In the course of project implementation, Company A has experienced signiï¬cant changes on the management and worker level. For instance, due to the required increase of production efï¬ciency, a crisis manager was hired. New managers seemed not always to be committed to the project objectives. Therefore, they did not support the project implementation adequately. It is advisable to discuss continuously the project course with the management and more precisely present the project impact on the current as well as on future production. The same applies to workers. In the case where the workers who were actively involved in the solution design leave the company and the workers who were not part of the design process evaluate the solution, incoherent results are very likely.

In practice, a single transmitter and receiver pair can operate with a bandwidth of 10â20 GHz for transmission distances of some tens of kilometers. Optical amplifiers, which most commonly operate at wavelengths near 1550 nm, can be used to increase the range of transmission. In the modulation process, the power of the carrier is varied in proportion to the voltage of the signal. Because of this, the effect of small unwanted components in fiber transmission systems is greatly reduced. Consider, for example, a small component of the optical signal resulting from a reflection within the fiber. If the optical power of the reflected component is x dB less than that of the main component, then after demodulation at the photodetector, the signal power contributed by the reflected component is 2x dB less than that from the main optical component. This also applies to small unwanted effects resulting from finite isolation of couplers, isolators, and other elements. Variations in the frequency response resulting from standing waves in microwave transmission lines are significantly less in optical fiber than in cable. A feature that must be taken into account in applications of optical fiber is the dispersion in velocity, D, usually specified in ps.nm # km/!1 . The difference in the time of propagation for two optical wavelengths that differ by ""$ traveling a distance ` in the fiber is D""$`. Figure 7.3 shows the dispersion for two types of fiber. Curve 1 is for a type of fiber widely used in early applications, and curve 2 represents a design in which the zero-dispersion wavelength is shifted to coincide approximately with the minimum-attenuation wavelength of 1550 nm. This optimization of the performance at 1550 nm is achieved by designing the fiber so that the dispersion of the cylindrical waveguide formed by the core of the fiber cancels the intrinsic dispersion of the glass at that wavelength. Consider a spectral component, at frequency !m , of a broadband signal that is modulated onto an optical carrier. Amplitude modulation of the signal results in sidebands spaced Ë!m in frequency with respect to the carrier. Because of the velocity dispersion, the two sidebands and the carrier each propagate down the fiber with slightly different velocities and thus exhibit relative offsets in time at the receiving end. Such time offsets result in attenuation of the amplitude of the high-frequency components of analog signals and in broadening of the pulses used to represent digital data. Thus, for both analog and digital transmission, dispersion Fig. 7.3 Dispersion D in single-mode optical fiber of two different designs, as a function of the optical wavelength."
117,170,0.167,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"This example shows Leandra doing will-work. She wants to shower Ms Koch.16 In order to do this, she needs Ms Koch to want to shower, or at least to not refuse it. Leandraâs initial use of the generic âyouâ indicates that entering the room cheerfully is a more general way of approaching residents. But she then adjusts to the person herself and to the severity of the residentâs condition, as is evidenced in Ms Kochâs example. In other words, generalisations are not useful here. To get Ms Koch to want to shower, Leandra attempts to sculpt her mood. Although sometimes ânothing worksâ and wanting remains not amenable to Leandra to work upon it, sometimes it does work: in those situations, Leandraâs smile causes Ms Koch to âalso become cheerfulâ, to âmagnify the emotionâ and to relax. This, in turn, results in her allowing Leandra âto do moreâ, including giving her a shower. In another example of this way of doing will-work, Joani often brought three cups of hot chocolate to Ms Veenstra along with her medicine. We drank the chocolate by her bedside together. Meanwhile, we talked about the weather or what we had done yesterday, or about the joint breakfast awaiting her downstairs. By doing this, Joani hoped to get Ms Veenstra into the mood for getting out of bed, and it often worked. In those cases, what Ms Veenstra wanted was aligned with Joaniâs desire for her to have breakfast, and for her to be with others. Sculpting moods and emotions is one way to align wanting. Two important conclusions can be drawn from this. Firstly, the story affirms that moods and emotions cannot be separated from wanting.17 Secondly, it shows will-work as a relational practice: Ms Koch and Leandra are"

The utilitarian point of view is also reflected in the increased focus on skills and employability in the EC. In many countries, this debate is progressively becoming interlinked with the debate on quality and quality assurance (e.g. the Danish committee on quality and relevance of higher education). While there is clearly a link between quality of education and employability, there is also a great danger in establishing a simplistic and linear connection between the two. There is a real danger that the essential âbildungâ and the civic development aspects of higher education is overlooked if a purely utilitarian approach is adopted. If a simple and linear correlation is introduced, the process of diversiï¬cation of higher education, providing access to education to students from all backgrounds throughout a studentâs life is often disregarded. If the goals of permeability, diversiï¬cation and flexibility are ignored, then quality assurance can create conformity rather than innovation, and the overriding aim of creating a Europe of Knowledge for an increasingly diverse student population might be lost."

The explicit attention for interactions between agents makes it possible for this type of model to simulate emergent properties of systems. These are properties at the macro scale that are not predictable from observing the micro units in isolation. If the decision rules of the agents are set such that they sufficiently look like human decision making they can simulate behavior at the meso-level of social organization, i.e. the behavior of heterogeneous groups of actors. Multi-agent-based models of land change are particularly well suited to representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions (Bousquet and Le Page 2004; Parker et al. 2003). Multi-agent systems are able to formalize decision-forming behavior of individual stakeholders, either based on theory (Happe et al. 2006), or based on observations and statistical analysis (Bousquet et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2007; Valbuena et al. 2010a). In the initial years of application of agent-based models to land change, most multi-agent models focused on either hypothetical or simplified representations of the real world to explore interactions between agents and between agents and the environment. Especially the parameterization of agent behavior in models for real case-studies turned out to be very complex. However, more recently a larger number of applications of agent-based models to real case studies worldwide have been published, showing the potential of the approach to explore the land change dynamics in local to regional level case studies (Le et al. 2012; Robinson et al. 2012; Valbuena et al. 2010b). At larger spatial scales, ranging from the region to the global level the principles of agent-based modeling have not yet been applied in simulation models, leaving most models at that level with highly simplified representations of human-environment interactions (Rounsevell and Arneth 2011). The possibilities for either upscaling or outscaling agent-based models have been described by Rounsevell and colleagues (Rounsevell et al. 2012), but have not yet been applied in operational models."

The weak version of RSL forbids relaxed writes completely, and does not constrain the value returned by a relaxed read. The stronger version provides singlelocation invariants for relaxed accesses, but its soundness proof relies strongly on a strengthened version of C/C++11 without po âª rf cycles (where po is program order, and rf is the reads-from relation), which forbids load buffering. When it comes to reasoning about coherence properties, even the strong version of RSL is surprisingly weak: it cannot be used to verify any of the coherence examples in this paper. In fact, RSL can be shown sound with respect to much weaker coherence axioms than what C/C++11 relaxed accesses provide. One notable feature of RSL which we do not support is read-modify-write (RMW) instructions (such as compare-and-swap and fetch-and-add). However,"

In addition, the authors address the issue of governance of transboundary groundwater resources and the relevant existing international legal frameworks. In conclusion, through a Global Vision for 2030, this chapter presents a way forwards to govern groundwater and a framework for action to achieve good governance, formulated by the Groundwater Governance Project jointly implemented by UNESCO, FAO, World Bank and IAH. To achieve the goals of the Shared Vision 2030, a Framework for Action has been developed. It describes the main steps to be taken, provides guidance on planning and prioritising actions and is an urgent call for action to all who can make a difference: national and local governments, international organisations, the private sector, civil society, media, educational institutions and professional organisations â but also well owners, groundwater users and concerned citizens everywhere. The main steps elaborated in the Framework for Action are understanding the context, creating a basis for governance, building effective institutions, making essential linkages, redirecting finances and establishing a process of planning and management. The Shared Global Vision for Groundwater Governance 2030 and the Global Framework for Action to achieve the vision on Groundwater Governance call for strengthening groundwater governance. This call for action urges countries, districts, communities, companies, organisations and individuals to safeguard the groundwater resource that is essential to meet their common future objectives and Sustainable Development Goals. This Framework for Action is designed to set in place the groundwater governance arrangements that will achieve this vision. Doug Merrey explores the likely trends and outcomes in water governance with a particular focus on cooperation and conflict over the management of water resources in two regions: South Asia and Southern Africa. With its extremely largescale shared river basins inhabited by nearly a billion mostly poor people, South Asia has struggled to find ways to co-manage water resources to benefit everyone equitably in a context where there is much potential benefit to be achieved. Southern Africa is considered an example of relative success in developing ways to cooperate â but implementation is incredibly complex in systems more water scarce than South Asia, though not as large. They examine the prospects for developing governance arrangements in the two regions through three âlensesâ which they characterise as âbeyond disciplinesâ, âbeyond scalesâ and âbeyond âinstitutionalâ hardware to âhumanâ softwareâ. Even those who have advocated for the role of institutions above, individuals have conceded, as noted for South Asia, that the behaviour of individuals within organisations determines the outcomes. More research needs to be conducted on the role of the individual in actively addressing complex waterrelated challenges, in redefining how multiple sectors cooperate around these issues and ultimately influencing socio-economic development at the regional level. At present, governance structures, organised nationally and transnationally on a basin scale in both regions, presume that âstakeholdersâ can adequately represent themselves in formal settings where allocation, use and management decisions are"

260,266,0.156,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"It is evident from the studies described here that anti-ranaviral immunity is multifaceted, complex, and likely species- and developmental stage-specific. Also evident are the many gaps in our understanding of the immune response to these pathogens as well as possible defects in the hostâs ability to mount effective responses that contain and eliminate these infections. It is particularly worrisome that Ranavirus and other genera within the family Iridoviridae have devised numerous, highly efficient strategies for evading, and even utilizing host immune components, to achieve persistence, facilitate dissemination and expand host range. Clearly, ranaviruses encode a large number of putative gene products, which represent both potential virulence factors as well as promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. While it is easy to dismiss lower vertebrate immune systems as functionally analogous to those of mammals, there is a growing literature suggesting otherwise. It is through the fundamental understanding of the physiological and ecological pressures governing these unique immune systems that we may begin to comprehend ranavirus infection strategies and the immune systems that may, or may not have adequately co-evolved to stop them. The investigation of ranavirus infection and immune subversion strategies should be approached not only by taking into account well-defined mammalian pathogens, but also by considering the possibility that ranaviruses may represent unique viral agents. In contrast to the majority of homeothermic vertebrate pathogens, ranaviruses are extraordinary in their ability to overcome cell and host tropism barriers, while their mechanisms of pathogenicity appear to be (at least partially) much less dependent on viral loads. Indeed, the immune systems of ectothermic hosts have evolved as the result of, and are subject to, different physiological and pathogenic pressures than those that have shaped the mammalian immune system. It stands to reason that ranavirus pathogens have co-evolved with these unique immune systems, thus we must garner greater insights into both to fully understand either.

With growing urbanisation around our metropolitan cities and regional centres, extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones impact directly on agriculture and on the logistical distribution of food. Drought affects human life and health as well as impacting dramatically on the sustainable development of society. It represents a pending danger for vulnerable agricultural systems that depend on the occurrence of rainfall, the security of water supply and the integrity of reservoirs. Developed countries are affected, but the impact is disproportionate within the developing world. Drought, especially when it results in famine, can change the life and economic progression of developing nations and stiï¬e their development for decades. A holistic approach is required to"
8,867,0.153,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","29.2 On Formation of QGP in Heavy Ion Collisions Maurice Jacob begins his presentation at 11:20, 22 June, 1982. âHeavy ion collisions offer the possibility to reach very high densities and very high temperatures over extended domains, many times larger than the size of a single hadron. The energy densities considered are of the order of 0.5â1.5 GeV/fm3 and the relevant temperatures are in the 200 MeV range. The great interest of reaching such conditions originates from recent developments in Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD, which make it very plausible that, while color confinement should prevail under standard circumstances, deconfinement should occur at sufficiently high density and (or) sufficiently high temperature. Under such conditions a new phase of matter, a quark-gluon plasma, is likely to exist. This phase should be viewed as due to a coalescence, or perhaps a percolation, of hadrons into larger entities and not as an actual separation of free quarks! . . . âOver an extended volume where the required density or temperature conditions would prevail, one expects that the properties of the physical vacuum would be modified. While the normal vacuum excludes the gluon field, the color-equivalent of the dielectric constant being zero (or practically zero), one would get a new vacuum state where quarks and gluons could propagate while interacting perturbatively. âThe equivalent of the dielectric constant would now be unity. The required conditions may be reached at high enough densities, hadrons being squeezed into one another, or at high enough temperature, the calculation of the partition function no longer favoring confining configurations whereby a color flux tube of fixed cross section extends between two color sources. The temperature at which the phase transition is expected to occur depends on the density, or on the quark chemical potential. One may thus separate two phases, a hadron phase and a quark gluon plasma, on a density-temperature diagram.. . . âThe presence of a phase transition could long be expected from phenomenological models with an exponentially increasing hadron spectrum. The limiting Hagedorn temperature, obtained as the specific heat of the hadron gas diverges, can"
176,131,0.153,Russia'S Turn To The East : Domestic Policymaking and Regional Cooperation,"In the years leading up to the conflict over Ukraine, oil prices were high, Western countries open to cooperation and foreign companies eager to invest in Russiaâespecially in the petroleum sector. Many Russian companies, including state-controlled oil and gas corporations, took on high levels of debt, based on the assumption that oil prices would remain high. After Crimea, Russia faced not only international sanctions but also a collapse in the price of oil. The combination of the lower oil price and sanctions left Russia economically and politically vulnerable, and potentially dependent on its biggest non-Western trading partner: China. After the introduction of Western sanctions, several major developments took place in Sino-Russian energy cooperation. In May 2014, the two countries reached a deal on the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline, with an estimated value of USD 400 billion (Overland et al. 2015, p.42). During the same year, imports of oil from Russia to China increased by 36 per cent, reaching 30 million tons (Cunningham 2015b). Oil exports from Russia even displaced other suppliers: in 2014, Chinese oil imports from Saudi Arabia fell by 8 per cent and from Venezuela by 11 per cent (Cunningham 2015a; see Fig. 6.1 for further details). This development was one important motivation behind Saudi Arabiaâs unexpected decision to raise oil production and lower the price of oil in 2014, despite the negative impact on Saudi revenues and on intra-OPEC solidarity. These developments create the impression that China was discreetly providing the financial backing for Russiaâs annexation of Crimea. While"

121,467,0.152,Becoming Citizens in a Changing World : IEA International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 International Report,"Civic and citizenship activities in classrooms and teacher preparation Chapter 2 of this report described the general approaches that the ICCS 2016 schools were taking to deliver civic and citizenship education in their classrooms. The chapter also reported principalsâ and teachersâ perceptions of the most important aims of this area of school education, and documented the types of pre-service and in-service training that teachers in the ICCS countries experience. In this section of the current chapter, we look at the activities carried out within participating schoolsâ classrooms during civic and citizenship education lessons from two perspectivesâstudentsâ and teachersâ. We also consider teachersâ responses to a question about their level of preparedness for teaching topics related to civic and citizenship education. The question in the ICCS 2016 student questionnaire on civic topics taught in school required students to indicate the extent to which they had learned about each of the following at their school: (a) âhow citizens can vote in local or national election;â (b) âhow laws are introduced and changed in <country of test>;â (c) âhow to protect the environment (e.g. through energy-saving or recycling);â (d) âhow to contribute to solving problems in the <local community>;â (e) âhow citizen rights are protected in <country of test>;â and (f) âpolitical issues and events in other countries.â We used these items to derive an IRT-based scale called civic learning at school. It had an average reliability across countries (Cronbachâs alpha = 0.80). The higher scale scores indicate higher levels of reported learning of civic issues at school. (For a description of this scale, see the item map in Figure 6.4, Appendix D.) On average across the participating countries, the highest percentages of students who said they had learned about the listed topics to a moderate or large extent were for how to protect the environment (81%), how citizens can vote in local and national elections (64%), and how citizen rights are protected in <country of test> (61%). The lowest percentages were for political issues and events in other countries (52%) and how to contribute to solving problems in the <local FRPPXQLW\!  6LJQLÄFDQWGLIIHUHQFHVHPHUJHGDFURVVWKHFRXQWULHVIRUDOOVL[WRSLFV VHH7DEOH 6.16), suggesting that students in different countries experience different degrees of emphasis on the civic-related topics they study at school. Table 6.16 also shows the national average scale scores for studentsâ learning of civic issues at school. Countries with the highest national average scale scores (three or more points above the ICCS 2016 average) were Chinese Taipei, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Peru. Those with the lowest national averages were Belgium (Flemish), Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands.

We also registered in most participating countries higher scale scores for students who anticipated completing a university degree. Here, the difference was two points on average across the participating countries. Students at or above Level B of civic knowledge scored higher than students below this level, with an ICCS average difference of three points."

As this species covers fairly the same niche as the European lobster and is also a high value seafood product on the market, it is another promising candidate that should be examined. Passive ï¬shery on brown crab is very common along Northern European coasts and also in several offshore areas of the German Bight and reduces the ecological pressure on the endangered lobster population. Clear positive effects on the potential of OWFs to function as refuge for ï¬sh and marine animals were observed for crustacean species such as brown crab (Cancer pagurus) due to increased opportunities for shelter and food availability (StelzenmÃ¼ller et al. 2016)."

The basic assumption herein is that the social web and Web 2.0 technologies allow scientists, on the one hand, to open up the research process and, on the other, to prepare the product of their research for interested non-experts (see Table 2). Accordingly, we recognize two different streams within the public school: The first is concerned with the accessibility of the research process (the production), the second with the comprehensibility of the research result (the product). Both streams involve the relationship between scientists and the public and define openness as a form of devotion to a wider audience. In the following section we will elaborate more on both streams in reference to relevant literature."

There is a 25.7 percent point difference in phone ownership between men and women in WHP compared with a 10.8 percent point difference in ENBP. Clearly, the relative social and economic status of women in the two provinces is reflected in phone ownership rates. These gender differences by provinces are also apparent in how the mobile phone is used and how frequently men and women make and receive calls and SMS messages. In matrilineal ENBP, women make and receive more calls than men, whereas in patrilineal WHP the reverse is the case and again the disparity between the genders is starker than in ENBP (Table 4). Similarly, in ENBP, women send more SMS messages than men and receive about the same number as men, while men from WHP send and receive more texts than women (Table 4). In summary, it seems that mobile phone technology is not yet contributing to a signiï¬cant erosion of the gender divide in WHP society. However, it is likely that mobile phone technology is empowering women by widening their social networks beyond their immediate communities by allowing them to maintain contact with relatives and friends living elsewhere. This is especially important for women in patrilineal societies when they move to the villages of their husbands and have limited contact with their natal relatives living elsewhere. It is also likely that the technology empowers women market sellers economically through, for example, enabling them to contact relatives in town to determine prices at local markets before committing to transporting garden produce to market. These beneï¬ts, of course, pertain more to women in accessible locations not far from urban markets who can respond quickly to such opportunities. Overall, however, when ENBP and WHP are compared it appears that the uptake and use of mobile phone technology reflects existing patterns of gender inequality. Women in matrilineal ENBP have much higher status in their society and this is reflected in their higher rate of mobile phone adoption and use relative to men, whereas in patrilineal WHP with an entrenched high level of gender inequity, men are clearly beneï¬ting far more from the new technology than women."

That failure still lies behind todayâs problems. When Japan was a developing country, the central government took the initiative in developing industries, which resulted in improved living standards of the people. Now Japan is one of the most advanced economies in the world, and the Japanese society is fully matured. Japan is now a âproblem-saddled advanced country.â We still do not see what Japan should become in the future nor which industries might help revitalize the economy and best position the country for a promising future.

We have no other choice than to clarify the issues, establish goals to solve them, and build an advanced society worthy of being called a role model for the world. This should be the right way for Japan to reconstruct itself. I believe that Japan has sufficient cutting-edge technology and cultural imagination to enable it to achieve its goals. New demand and a new economy will be created through seeking solutions to the complex problems that all advanced nations face in the twenty-first century.

126,305,0.143,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"The pastoral economy in transboundary Turkana lands has drastically declined in recent decades, largely due to the effects of colonial and post-colonial policies. Faced with radical herd losses, thousands of Turkana households have moved to Lake Turkanaâs western shoreline for ï¬shing and/or herding. This populationâlargely uncountedâis extremely vulnerable to loss of accessible Lake Turkana water, ï¬sheries resources, and lakeside grazing. The Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural plantations along the Omo would cause major shoreline retreat and eliminate the Omo Riverâs annual flood âpulseâ of fresh-water and nutrients into the lake. Major loss of ï¬sh reproductive habitat and ï¬sh stocks as well as potable water, along with desiccation of lakeside environments essential to livestock and people would result. As conditions worsen, a general movement of ï¬shing and ï¬shing/pastoral villages southward toward Fergusonâs Gulfâitself drying outâand around towns, in search of relief aid or survival opportunities, is likely. With no practical means of continued livelihood, hundreds of thousands of Turkana ï¬shers and pastoralists would face region wide hunger and conditions for disease epidemics. Cross-border conflict between these Turkana and their northern neighbors would sharply escalate, especially in the face of regional arms trafï¬cking. Northern and central Turkana protests and pleas for help have so far been ignored by the Kenyan government which continues to militarize the region."

Since the cost function in (12.5) is submodular, it can be minimized efficiently using graph cuts [20] with the implementation of [14]. During the minimization, we process a smaller volume, that is, a cut-out around the zero level of the thresholded voxel map P > Ï , which allows us to save memory and speed up the calculations. A comparison between the resulting segmentation of the spleen with graph cuts, using the initial voxel map, P, and the refined probability map after the random forest step, Pr , is illustrated in Fig. 12.3."

133,398,0.142,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","labour market participation. Age was recoded into three categories (50â64; 65â75, and 75 and older). Educational qualiï¬cations were grouped into three categories: low, mid, and high education, where low level of education is deï¬ned as pre-primary or primary level of education, and high refers to upper secondary level of education or above. For marital status, we distinguished between people who were âmarried or cohabitingâ, âdivorced, separated, or never marriedâ, or âwidowedâ. We decided to group the never married with those who are separated or divorced because the number of them with children is very low and it is possible that they used to live with a cohabiting partner. Preliminary analyses were also carried out considering marital history indicators such as the total number of marriages, binary indicators of previous widowhood and divorce, as well as the age at or the length of the latest marital disruption. All these indicators were not signiï¬cant; therefore, we present results on the marital status at the time of the interview only. Three geographical areas were considered (North, Centre, and South) based on the statistical partition proposed by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (www.istat.it). Wealth was measured using a dichotomised indicator of whether the respondent owned his or her house or not (regardless of whether they were mortgage-free). Similarly, economic resources were measured using a dichotomised indicator of whether the respondent perceived that their household was able to make ends meet with great difï¬culty or not. Employment history was measured by distinguishing between respondents who have/had ever done any paid work and those who never worked. As an additional control variable for the Italian familialistic context, we introduced in the model a variable measuring whether parents had weekly contact with their children. Our hypothesis was to test if family closeness buffers the association found between indicators of fertility histories and subjective health. No measures of previous health conditions were asked in the ISF, whereas SHARE collected several indicators of participantsâ recall of health in childhood (deï¬ned as by when respondents were born up to and including when they were 15 years old). In particular, we considered an indicator of early life poor health if respondents missed school for more than one month, whether they recall being conï¬ned to bed or home for more than one month, or whether they were in hospital for a month or more because of a health condition during childhood. Moreover, SHARE asks questions about the respondentsâ socio-economic conditions during childhood, and we considered two proxies of these conditions using information on whether the respondents were living with both natural parents at the age of 10, and whether they had enough books to ï¬ll one shelf or one or more bookcases in the household."
