391,228,0.951,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"1996; Stubbins et al. 2006a, 2008; Valentine and Zepp 1993; Xie et al. 2005; Zafiriou et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2006; Ziolkowski and Miller 2007; Zuo and Jones 1995). A biotic source of CO originating from macro-algae was also investigated by different groups (Loewus and Delwiche 1963; Troxler and Dokos 1973), but King (2001) concluded that this source is not a significant fraction of the global oceanic source. Recently, laboratory studies of trace gas emissions by various phytoplankton species have shown that CO is also emitted directly by phytoplankton under photosynthetically available radiation (Gros et al. 2009). Cyanobacteria and diatoms were the largest CO emitters and this source could account for up to 20 % of the CO production in seawater. Finally, another source of oceanic CO is the so-called √¢¬Ä¬údark production√¢¬Ä¬ù which has been reported by several groups (Day and Faloona 2009 and references therein) and which is needed to explain non-zero CO values below the euphotic zone (Kettle 2005). The first detailed measurements of CO in the mixed layer of the oceanic water column in the Pacific Ocean showed that it varies seasonally and regionally with daily means between 0.1 and 4.7 nmol L 1 (Bates et al. 1995). CO showed pronounced diurnal cycles with maxima in the afternoon, in agreement with the photochemical nature of the main source in water. Since then, measurements of CO have been performed only over a few additional areas in the open ocean. Stubbins et al. (2006b) determined values between 0.2 and 2.6 nmol L 1 during an Atlantic Meridional cruise (from 35  S to 54  N). Gros et al. (unpublished data) measured values around 1 nmol L 1 in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, with levels rising to 20 nmol L 1 in a phytoplankton bloom near the Argentinian coast. Xie et al. (2009) conducted measurements in the open waters of the South Eastern Beaufort Sea at two different seasons with mean concentrations of 0.45 and 4.7 nmol L 1 in spring and autumn, respectively. In shelf waters, CO concentrations were also found to be variable but with values in the upper range of those measured in the open ocean. Day and Faloona (2009) found values between 2.7 and 17 nmol L 1 for a Californian upwelling system; Xie et al. (2005) measured values around 1 nmol L 1 in the Beaufort Sea and Gulf Stream and 2√¢¬Ä¬ì18 nmol L 1 in the coastal NW Atlantic. Yang et al. (2010, 2011) have recently"

241,772,0.945,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(GCMs) used as surface boundary conditions in RCMs might be biased due to the coarse resolution of GCMs. Such biases would affect model sensitivity and hence the results in climate projections (Meier et al. 2011d). To reduce computational demands, scenario simulations were performed for selected time slices only (e.g. Madsen 2009) which requires the application of the √¢¬Ä¬òdelta√¢¬Ä¬ô or √¢¬Ä¬òdelta change√¢¬Ä¬ô approach (e.g. Meier 2002). Since the √Ø¬¨¬Årst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea basin (BACC Author Team 2008), the number of relevant scenario simulations has increased considerably. In particular, a large number of scenario simulations were carried out during 2009√¢¬Ä¬ì2011 within the ECOSUPPORT project (advanced modelling tool for scenarios of the Baltic Sea ECOsystem to SUPPORT decision making, www. baltex-research.eu/ecosupport). The following items characterise the new simulations compared to the √Ø¬¨¬Årst BACC assessment: √¢¬Ä¬¢ The horizontal resolution of atmosphere and ocean model components increased to typically less than 25 and 3.6 km, respectively (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). √¢¬Ä¬¢ New model versions of GCMs and RCMs were used. √¢¬Ä¬¢ The results and assumptions of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) were used instead of those from the IPCC√¢¬Ä¬ôs Third Assessment Report (IPCC 2001). √¢¬Ä¬¢ Multi-model ensemble modelling was introduced to estimate uncertainties due to biases in the Baltic Sea models (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). √¢¬Ä¬¢ Instead of time slices often combined with the delta approach (e.g. Meier 2006), transient simulations (1960√¢¬Ä¬ì 2100) were performed (e.g. Neumann 2010). √¢¬Ä¬¢ Coupled physical√¢¬Ä¬ìbiogeochemical models were used (Neumann 2010; Meier et al. 2011a, b, c, 2012a, b, c; Eilola et al. 2012; Neumann et al. 2012). This chapter relies on literature concerning climate change scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea between 2007 and (March) 2012. The focus is on projected changes in water temperature, salinity, sea ice, storm surges, and wind waves. Changes in marine biogeochemical variables such as oxygen, nutrients, and phytoplankton (chlorophyll) concentrations are addressed in Chaps. 18 and 19. The graphics included in this chapter (with the exception of Fig. 13.6) show ensemble mean changes projected for 2069√¢¬Ä¬ì2098 relative to a baseline/reference of 1978√¢¬Ä¬ì2007 in transient scenario simulations calculated with three coupled physical√¢¬Ä¬ì biogeochemical models for the Baltic Sea following Meier et al. (2011b, 2012c).

241,955,0.942,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Freshwater biogeochemistry in relatively unperturbed aquatic systems within the Baltic Sea catchment and the background load of the biogenic elements C, N, P and Si is the result of its weathering regime, which characterises total ionic strength, acidity (pH) and alkalinity as well as vegetation cover and vegetation type. Generally, weathering reactions charge rainwater with basic cations and anions including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), orthophosphate and silicic acid when in√Ø¬¨¬Åltrating natural soils (Drever 1997). Nitrogen enters the system through biological N √Ø¬¨¬Åxation, and organic C stems from recently produced biomass (mainly litter and root exudates) (Froberg et al. 2003; Karltun et al. 2005; van Hees et al. 2005; Giesler et al. 2007; Jonsson et al. 2007) and older stored soil organic C (Vonk et al. 2008; Vonk and Gustafsson 2009). However, the bedrock dominated by acid volcanic and plutonic acid rocks as well as the occurrence of coniferous forests and wetlands storing huge amounts of organic C leads to freshwaters in boreal watersheds characterised by low ionic strength, low alkalinity and high concentrations of humic and fulvic acids that form the major pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP). Background loads and concentrations in the cultivated watersheds are dif√Ø¬¨¬Åcult to estimate because humans have influenced these landscapes over many centuries. However, the occurrence of sedimentary bedrock in cultivated watersheds and the higher temperatures that increase weathering reactions lead to a higher ionic strength and higher alkalinity. Relatively natural unperturbed conditions can be found in the well-studied River Kalix√É¬§lven (Ingri et al. 1997; Humborg et al. 2004), in the Simojoki river basin (Lepisto et al. 2008) and in unmanaged headwater catchments (Mattsson et al. 2003; Finer et al. 2004; Kortelainen et al. 2006a). In most other watersheds around the Baltic Sea, freshwater biogeochemistry is affected by following human drivers: atmospheric deposition, forestry and wetland management, eutrophication, and damming and other types of hydrological alteration."

Several attempts to numerically reconstruct the wave climate in the Baltic Sea using a better resolution (down to about 3 nautical miles or about 5 km) have been undertaken for many areas and single locations (Table 9.2). Schmager et al. (2008), Soomere (2008) reviewed the relevant literature until 2007 and described the basic features of the wave climate. Long-term reconstructions of the Baltic Sea wave √Ø¬¨¬Åelds are a complicated task and usually contain high uncertainties (Cie√Ö¬õlikiewicz and Papli√Ö¬Ñska-Swerpel 2008; Kriezi and Broman 2008). The largest source of uncertainty is the wind information. The quality and spatial resolution of the wind data (down to about 10 km, Tuomi et al. 2011) have increased over the past decade. Simulations of long-term change in wave √Ø¬¨¬Åelds are, however, hampered by substantial temporal inhomogeneity (Tuomi et al. 2011), large spatial differences in data quality (R√É¬§√É¬§met et al. 2009; Soomere and R√É¬§√É¬§met 2011), and by the inability of even the most advanced atmospheric models to reproduce air flow accurately in several Baltic Sea sub-basins (Keevallik and Soomere 2010).

When C, N and P in the sediment are no longer signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcantly interacting with the water column, they can be considered as buried. Buried C and N in the sediments of the Baltic Sea are mainly in the form of organic compounds, whereas a substantial part of P occurs as inorganic forms such as associates with Fe-oxyhydroxides and various calcium compounds (Conley et al. 1997; Carman 1998; Aigars and Carman 2001; Mort et al. 2010). Burial of P formed in the marine system removes P from the nutrient cycle, while refractory P transported from land is buried passively (Ruttenberg and Berner 1993; Delaney 1998). In the Baltic, reactive P (i.e. potentially bioavailable that can promote primary productivity, Anderson et al. 2001) is mainly buried in organic form (Mort et al. 2010). It has been hypothesised that N and P are preferentially released during the mineralisation of organic matter and that the remainder that is deposited on the sea floor and buried is enriched in C (e.g. Froelich et al. 1982; Andersen and Jensen 1992; Ingall et al. 1993; Anderson et al. 2001). Hence, atomic ratios of organic C, N and P in sediment, compared to those in plankton (Red√Ø¬¨¬Åeld et al. 1963), have been used to draw conclusions regarding the decomposition or origin of the buried material (e.g. Froelich et al. 1982; Ruttenberg and Go√É¬±i 1997). However, atomic ratios are affected by many biogeochemical processes and properties of the sedimentation environment (e.g. Ingall and Van Cappellen 1990; Ingall and Jahnke 1994; Anderson et al. 2001; Jilbert et al. 2011). C:N:P ratios presented in the literature for the Baltic Sea sediments vary depending on sea area, bottom type and sediment depth (e.g. Carman and Cederwall 2001), the variation being clearly higher in the C:P ratio than that in the C:N ratio. In the Baltic Sea, characteristic conditions that affect sedimentation and burial of C, N and P are, for example,"

An uptake of 1.8  1.0 Pg C year 1 has been obtained by inversion of tropospheric CO2 (Gurney et al. 2004; adjusted by Gruber et al. 2009), while a net ocean sink of 1.9  0.7 Pg C year 1 has been estimated from a surface water CO2 climatology (Takahashi et al. 2009; adjusted by Gruber et al. 2009).

376,252,0.939,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Similar results were observed in open top chamber (OTC) experiments in the shortgrass steppe. Elevated [CO2] stimulated above- and belowground production and increased rhizodeposition almost 100 % (Pendall et al. 2004). Results also suggest that available soil N remained high during the 5-year experiment presumably due to increased soil water promoting more rapid N mineralization (Dijkstra et al. 2008). No differences were observed in gaseous N loss (Mosier et al. 2002). Research on elevated [CO2] in the shortgrass steppe was subsequently expanded to include effects of warming through the PHACE experiment, and [CO2] and warming produced contrasting effects on soil processes. In contrast to earlier studies, elevated [CO2] resulted in a more closed N cycle by promoting microbial immobilization of N, decreasing soil inorganic N availability (Dijkstra et al. 2010; Carrillo et al. 2012). In contrast, warming enhanced inorganic N presumably because of greater rates of decomposition. Similar results have been observed for grasslands in Australia, where elevated [CO2] decreased available soil N, but warming of 2 √Ç¬∞C plus elevated [CO2] prevented this effect (Hovenden et al. 2008). Results from PHACE also suggest that the interacting effects of warming and elevated CO2 may decrease ecosystem C storage (Pendall et al. 2013).

Until now, only a limited number of global surveys have been conducted on the quantity and distribution of microplastics in the oceans (Lusher 2015). Most surveys focused on specific oceanic regions and habitats, such as coastal areas, regional seas, gyres or the poles (Thompson et al. 2004, Collignon et al. 2012; Rios and Moore 2007). Concentrations of microplastics at sea vary from thousands to hundreds of thousands of particles km√¢¬à¬í2 and latest reports suggest that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs oceans from the water column (Lattin et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2011) to sediments even of the deep sea (Moore et al. 2001b; Law et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 2011; Cole et al. 2011; Collignon et al. 2012; Erikssen et al. 2014; Reisser et al. 2013; van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2015). Recently, microplastics were also recorded from Arctic sea ice in densities two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported from highly contaminated surface waters, such as those of the Pacific gyre (Obbard et al. 2014). This has important implications considering the projected acceleration in sea ice melting due to global climate change and concomitant release of microplastics to the Arctic marine ecosystem. Time-series data on the composition and abundance of microplastics are sparse. However, available evidence on long-term trends suggests various patterns in microplastic concentrations. A decade ago, Thompson et al. (2004) demonstrated the broad spatial extent and accumulation of this type of contamination. They found plastic particles in sediments from U.K. beaches and archived among the plankton in samples dating back to the 1960s with a significant increase in abundance over time. More recent evidence indicated that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific subtropical gyre have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades (Goldstein et al. 2013). However, no change in microplastic concentration was observed at the surface of the North Atlantic gyre for a period of 30 years (Law et al. 2010). Less is known about the composition of microplastics in the oceans. Evidence suggests a temporal decrease in the average size of plastic litter (Barnes et al. 2009; Erikssen et al. 2014). Studies based on the stomach contents of shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) in the Bering Sea also indicated a decrease in √¢¬Ä¬òindustrial√¢¬Ä¬ô primary pellets and an increase in √¢¬Ä¬òuser√¢¬Ä¬ô plastic between the 1970s and the late 1990s (Vlietstra and Parga 2002) but constant levels over the last decade (Van Franeker et al. 2011). Similarly, long-term data from The Netherlands since the 1980s show a decrease of industrial plastics and an increase in user plastics, with shipping and fisheries being the main sources (van Franeker 2012)."

A hindcast using geostrophic winds indicates another maximum to the south of Gotland (R√É¬§√É¬§met and Soomere 2010). This may be explained by large interannual and decadal variability in wind patterns over the area that naturally causes extensive variations in both average and extreme wave patterns. A very similar spatial pattern of heights to the one shown in Fig. 9.16 (left panel) is found for extreme waves (threshold of the 1 % or the 99th percentile of signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant wave height for each year) based on geostrophic winds (Soomere and R√É¬§√É¬§met 2011). The empirical distributions of the occurrence of different wave heights at offshore measurement sites (such as Almagrundet, Bogsk√É¬§r, the wave-rider in the northern Baltic Proper and at the Darss Sill) resemble a Rayleigh distribution, with typical values of the shape parameter of 1.5√¢¬Ä¬ì1.8 (Soomere 2008; Soomere et al. 2011). The most frequent wave heights are usually in the range 0.5√¢¬Ä¬ì0.75 m. Signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant wave heights greater than 4 m occur offshore with a probability of about 1 %, that is, during about 60 h per year. Signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant wave heights over 7 m have been measured, on average, about twice per decade in the northern Baltic Proper (Soomere 2008; Tuomi et al. 2011) and so can be considered extreme conditions. The wave climate is, however, highly intermittent and the sea occasionally experiences very high waves. The largest instrumentally measured values of signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant wave heights (Hs) are Hs = 8.2 m in the northern Baltic Proper on 22 December 2004 (Directional Waverider, Tuomi et al. 2011) and Hs = 7.82 m on 13/14 January 1984 at Almagrundet [upward-looking echo sounder; estimated from the 10th highest waves based on Rayleigh distribution; an alternative estimate from the wave spectrum is Hs = 7.28 m (Broman et al. 2006)]. The highest individual instrumentally measured waves were 14 and 12.75 m, respectively. Numerical simulations indicate that Hs may reach 9.5√¢¬Ä¬ì10 m in the northeastern Baltic Proper at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, to the north-west of the Latvian coast and in the south-eastern part of the Gulf of Gdansk (Schmager et al. 2008; Soomere et al. 2008a; Tuomi et al. 2011). The properties of waves in a particular region and storm event depend on the match of the geometry of the sea area and the wind pattern of the storm (Augustin 2005; Soomere et al. 2008a; Schmager et al. 2008). Typical and extreme wave heights are much lower in subbasins of the Baltic Sea. A large proportion of the low waves (Hs < 0.25 m) for most of the coastal visual observation sites (except for Vilsandi) (Zaitseva-P√É¬§rnaste et al. 2009, 2011) resembles an analogous property of simulated distribution in semi-sheltered bays (Soomere 2005). The frequency of occurrence of waves with Hs > 4 m is very low for all subbasins except the Bothnian Sea (Tuomi et al. 2011) and waves with Hs > 2 m may be considered extreme for semi-"

F2apm1 was collected in August 2005. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed using QIIME version 1.7.0 (Caporaso et al. 2010) for clustering into OTUs at a 97 % similarity cut-off and for taxonomic affiliation of the OTUs. Any improper taxonomic affiliations by QIIME were modified manually as judged by the phylogenetic analysis described in previous reports (Kato et al. 2009a, b, 2010). It should be noted that the taxonomy within Archaea has not been standardized yet, and the affiliation for some archaeal groups based on the QIIME-equipped reference database is doubtful: for example, pMC1A4 and the related clones in Marine Benthic Group E (MBGE) was affiliated with Methanobacteriales. Therefore, the taxonomic affiliation of the detected clones was modified manually based on the archaeal phylogenetic tree as shown in Suppl. 24.2, which is provided in SILVA-Ref-NR database release 111 (Quast et al. 2012). A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree for Zetaproteobacteria was constructed by PhyML version 3.0 (Guindon et al. 2010). Coverage for each clone library was calculated using mothur version 1.2.8 (Schloss et al. 2009). Bacterial and archaeal community structures were compared by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) using unweighted UniFrac (Lozupone and Knight 2005) equipped with QIIME. The sequencing process, i.e., DNA extraction, PCR, cloning and sequencing, was almost identical for all samples (Kato et al. 2009a, b, 2010). PCR was performed using a prokaryote-universal PCR primer set, Uni516F and Uni1406R, and an archaea-universal primer set, Arc8F and Uni1406R. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were dominant in the clone library data constructed using the prokaryote-universal PCR primer set (Kato et al. 2009a, b, 2010). Only the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were extracted and used for bacterial community analyses in this study.

Burial is most effective in the deep basins, which accumulate resuspended material from erosion and transportation areas. Carman and Cederwall (2001) estimated the contributions of erosion (19√¢¬Ä¬ì33 %), transportation (38√¢¬Ä¬ì46 %) and accumulation (28√¢¬Ä¬ì41 %) areas to the sea floor of the Baltic Proper, the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga. Figure 18.11 shows the spatial variation in particulate organic C content in the sediments (Leipe et al. 2011). Sedimentation rates of organic matter vary spatially, especially in the archipelagos because of the fractured topography (Winterhalter et al. 1981) and temporally because of the seasonality of plankton growth and senescence (Bianchi et al. 2002). Anoxia which is common in the Baltic Sea can favour burial of organic matter but diminish the burial of P because the formation of Fe-oxyhydroxides that bind PO4 is inhibited (Van Cappellen and Ingall 1994; Ingall et al. 1993; Mort et al. 2010; Jilbert et al. 2011). In the Baltic Sea, Edlund and Carman (2001) reported higher organic C:P ratios for anoxic than for oxic sites and Jilbert et al. (2011) suggested increasing rates of P mineralisation in more reduced conditions. However, it is also conceivable that the shift to higher C:P ratios is caused by a slower organic C mineralisation. In oxic areas, benthic fauna affect burial of C, N and P (Aller 1988; Kristensen 1988; Andersen and Jensen 1991; Andersen and Kristensen 1992; Norkko et al. 2011)."

For example, models generally have problems with sub-grid precipitation, simulating precipitation more often, but in lower amounts, than reality. As precipitation scavenging is a complex and nonlinear process (e.g. Barrie 1992) such issues will cause errors in modelled wet deposition that are dif√Ø¬¨¬Åcult to evaluate. There are also many uncertainties inherent in the deposition monitoring methods themselves (Draaijers and Erisman 1993; Erisman et al. 2005). Large differences between models were found in the global models participating in the COSAM study, in which the wet deposition ef√Ø¬¨¬Åciency varied by a factor of four (Roelofs et al. 2001).

The fluctuation of geochemical composition in hydrothermal mixing zones may have a significant impact on the rate of microbial growth and metabolic activity, biogeochemical reactions, and the dominant microbial population. In particular, reduced compounds such as H2, CH4, HS , and Fe2+ are not only essential energy sources for chemolithotrophs but also factors that control the composition and density of the microbial community. Previous studies have investigated habitat components, for example, the boundary zone (interface) between hydrothermal fluid and ambient seawater, including low-temperature diffusive flow (Holden et al. 1998; Huber et al. 2002, 2003; Perner et al. 2007), chimney structures (Schrenk et al. 2003; Takai et al. 2001), and hydrothermal sediments (Nunoura et al. 2010; Teske et al. 2002; Yanagawa et al. 2013). These studies demonstrated the prevalence of Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and various candidate divisions in the hydrothermal system. Due to fluctuations in the environmental conditions, microbial communities in hydrothermally influenced regions exhibit variability on various spatial and temporal scales, including large-scale intra- and inter-field variability (Flores et al. 2012; Huber et al. 2010; Nunoura and Takai 2009), short-term temporal and spatial variability (Perner et al. 2009, 2013), and spatial variability on a small scale of a few centimeters to meters (Nakagawa et al. 2005; Takai et al. 2004). However, most studies focused on the variability of specific microbial populations in the zone adjacent to hydrothermal vents. To better understand microbial"

Mud volcanoes are large seabed structures (diameters of 1√¢¬Ä¬ì10 kilometers [km]; 0.6√¢¬Ä¬ì6.2 miles [mi]) formed by gas, pore fluid, and mud eruptions with a centrally pointed, flat, or crater-like top (Figure 5.52) (Prior et al. 1989; Milkov et al. 2003). Smaller depressions can form in the seafloor due to gas eruptions (10√¢¬Ä¬ì1,000 m; 32.8√¢¬Ä¬ì3,280.8 ft) called pockmarks (Figures 5.53 and 5.54) (Foucher et al. 2009). Structures below the seafloor can extend kilometers acting as migration pathways for seepage and are called gas chimneys (Foucher et al. 2009). Gas hydrate can form mounds as it expands and accumulates (Fisher et al. 2007; Boetius and Suess 2004). High-energy releases of petroleum can result in the formation of emulsions that mix water and sediments with seeping fluids. This often results in seepage being retained in sea-bottom sediments due to the increased density of the mixture; therefore, not all seafloor seeps result in sea-surface slicks. High seafloor reflectivity or amplitude responses and acoustic wipe-out zones are caused by the influx of gases and liquids to the seabed, seafloor lithification, physical disruption of internal sediment layering, and gas-hydrate formation and decomposition (Roberts and Aharon 1994, Roberts et al. 1990, 1992, 2007, 2010; Gay et al. 2011). Since 1998, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has mapped over 31,000 seafloor acoustic amplitude anomalies in the deepwater northern Gulf of Mexico using 3D time-migrated seismic surveys (Figure 5.55) (Shedd et al. 2012)."

241,676,0.936,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The GCMs were not designed for direct application in impact models. Prudhomme et al. (2002) stated that the quality of their output did not allow for direct use in hydrological impact studies, because the spatial and temporal scales were too coarse. Wilby et al. (1999) recommended the use of downscaling techniques before the GCM output data could be used in impact studies. There are many possibilities for downscaling GCM output: direct use of RCM output (Wood et al. 2004), use of bias-corrected RCM output (Wood et al. 2004; Fowler et al. 2007a), statistical downscaling (Wilby et al. 2000; M√É¬ºller-Wohlfeil et al. 2000), stochastic weather generators (Evans and Schreider 2002) or weather typologies, and/or indices (Pilling and Jones 2002). The skills of different downscaling methods differ considerably between variables and regions. Hydrologic simulation was found to be sensitive to biases in the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation at the monthly level, especially where the seasonal snow pack transfers run-off from one season to the next (Fowler et al. 2007c). Using the example of the Lule River in northern Sweden and two GCMs used to force the same RCM, Graham et al. (2007a) have shown that the choice of driving GCM has a greater impact on results than the choice of GHG emission scenario. The strong impact of the choice of GCM was also emphasised by Widmann et al. (2003), Jasper et al. (2004), Salath√É¬© (2005), and Wilby et al. (2006). Fowler et al. (2007a) stated that at least two variables√¢¬Ä¬î temperature and precipitation√¢¬Ä¬îhad to be downscaled for impact studies in hydrology. In impact models, the physical consistency between variables is very important. To obey this requirement for physical consistency, multi-variate methods should be applied which yield simultaneous correction of relevant variables. This is possible when RCMs are used (Fowler and Kilsby 2007; Fowler et al. 2007a; Graham et al. 2007a, b), but is generally not in statistical downscaling. A multi-site approach should be used when spatial consistency is needed."

Given uncertainty in climate model parameter values, 17 different combinations of parameter values were used to identify ranges in possible temperature and precipitation changes (see Chap. 11, Fig. 11.3). Despite substantial variability between the 17 iterations, all projections indicate a warmer and wetter climate by 2099. From these 17 scenarios, three were selected for application in the models to cover a range of possible change (Q0, Q8 and Q16). Ensemble members were selected to provide a central baseline (Q0), a warmer and drier scenario during the mid-century (Q8), and a much warmer and wetter scenario for both 2050 and 2099 (Q16). Sea-level rise is also a critical issue for Bangladesh. Global sea-level rise scenarios are based directly on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Church et al. 2013). These are not explicitly coupled to the Q0, Q8 and Q16 scenarios, and their application is explained in the relevant chapter (see Chaps. 14 and 16). Land subsidence is taken from observations (Chap. 15), while example cyclones are used to illustrate their possible effects (Chap. 16)."
35,109,0.936,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Recently, Kim et al. (2014a, 2015a) cultivated Gracilaria tikvahiae and Saccharina latissima in open water nutrient bioextraction farms in Long Island Sound (LIS) and the Bronx River Estuary (BRE), and evaluated the nutrient bioextraction performance in urbanized estuaries. They estimated that the biomass yields of G. tikvahiae and S. latissima could be up to 21 and 62 metric tons fresh weight per hectare, respectively. The potential nitrogen removal could exceed 320 kg N ha√¢¬à¬í1 year√¢¬à¬í1 from LIS (280 kg ha√¢¬à¬í1 from Saccharina and 40 kg ha√¢¬à¬í1 from Gracilaria) and 430 kg N ha√¢¬à¬í1 year√¢¬à¬í1 from the BRE site (280 kg ha√¢¬à¬í1 from Saccharina and 150 kg ha√¢¬à¬í1 from Gracilaria). Seaweed is also an important CO2 sink and the duration of net CO2 removal can be extended if the biomass is used in environmentally friendly ways (Chung et al. 2013). Kim et al. (2014a, 2015a) estimated that Gracilaria and Saccharina could sequester up to 300 (LIS) and 727 kg C ha√¢¬à¬í1 (BRE), and 1800 (LIS) and 1350 kg C ha√¢¬à¬í1 (BRE), respectively. Together, over 2000 kg C ha√¢¬à¬í1 could be removed by alternating these two species at the seaweed farm sites. An economic value of nutrient bioextraction was estimated. Considering the most recent nutrient credit values in the USA for these two elements (US $12.37 kg√¢¬à¬í1 N, US $6.00√¢¬Ä¬ìUS $60.00 mt√¢¬à¬í1 C (as CO2), Stephenson and Shabman 2011; CDP 2013; CT DEEP 2014; Tedesco et al. 2014), the potential economic values of C and N removal could exceed $3000 ha√¢¬à¬í1, which could be additional income for seaweed growers beyond the value of seaweed products, if seaweed aquaculture is incorporated in the Connecticut Nitrogen Credit Trading Program and a carbon-pricing scheme (CDP 2013). Considering the global seaweed production and tissue carbon and nitrogen contents for each species, total extractive nitrogen and carbon by seaweed aquaculture can be estimated. Considering a 10:1 DW:FW ratio and average values of nitrogen (Pyropia/Porphyra: 5.5%, Gracilaria: 3.0%, Kappaphycus/Eucheuma: 1.7%, kelp: 2.0% and Sargassum: 4.1%) and carbon (Pyropia/Porphyra: 38%, Gracilaria: 28%, Kappaphycus/Eucheuma: 29%, kelp: 30% and Sargassum: 34%), the total nitrogen and carbon removal by these √Ø¬¨¬Åve major aquaculture groups is approximately 54 million t of nitrogen per year and 700 million t of carbon per year (equivalent to 2600 million t of CO2), respectively (Asare and Harlin 1983; Gerard 1997; Schaffelke and Klumpp 1998; Gevaert et al. 2001; Schaffelke 2001; Chung et al. 2002; Rawson et al. 2002; Sahoo and Ohno 2003; Dean and Hurd 2007; Kim et al. 2007, 2014a, 2015a; Buschmann et al. 2008; Abreu et al. 2009; Robertson-Andersson et al. 2009; Levine and Sahoo 2010; Broch et al. 2013). This is, in fact, a signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant amount of carbon and nitrogen removal. In 2013, global nitrogen discharge to coastal waters and the open ocean via leaching and riverine transport was estimated to be up to 70 billion t (Fowler et al. 2013). During the same period, carbon emissions due to fossil fuel use (and cement production) was 9.9 billion t. Seaweed aquaculture during the same period has removed approximately 0.13% of nitrogen discharge from leaching and riverine transport and 6.6% of carbon emission via fossil fuel use. The extractive sequestration of nutrients by seaweeds provides ecosystem services that need to be recognized and valued appropriately (Chopin 2014). Much has"

According to the validation with observed climate along the historical period, the RCM was bias-corrected for the whole simulated period (Cervigni et al. 2013 √¢¬Ä¬ì Chap. 4 and Appendix B). To take into account the uncertainty on future climate outcomes nine GCMs simulations taking part of the CMIP3 experiment plus those from the CMCC-MED GCM, were used to √¢¬Ä¬úperturb√¢¬Ä¬ù the RCM results along the period 2006√¢¬Ä¬ì2065 and maintain high resolution. The GCMs chosen for the simulations were thus: HadCM3, CGCM_2.3.2, CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, CCSM3, MIROC3.2, GFDL_cm2.1, ECHAM5, FGOALS, and CMCC-MED.

Pronounced seasonality of the brominated compounds has been observed in coastal regions, with elevated concentrations during summer months (Klick 1992; Hughes et al. 2009; Orlikowska and Schulz-Bull 2009). Diurnal variations are also observed with elevated concentrations around midday (Ekdahl et al. 1998; Karlsson et al. 2008). Laboratory studies have shown CHBr3 production from arctic diatom cultures (Moore et al. 1996b). Since then, high field concentrations of brominated trace gases have generally been found to be associated with diatom-rich open waters, especially upwelling systems (e.g. Baker et al. 2000). Indeed, significant correlations with CHBr3 were found for low concentrations of diatom marker pigments in the Mauritanian upwelling. However, CHBr3 concentrations do not continue to increase with high diatom abundances and chlorophyll a values (Quack et al. 2007). Biological sources of CHBr3 also correlated with degradation pigments and the decay of organic matter. Cyanobacteria have been shown to be a bromocarbon source in the Baltic Sea (Karlsson et al. 2008). The parameterisation of CHBr3 concentration with chlorophyll a and mixed layer depth has been tested (Palmer and Reason 2009) and found in some tropical areas to satisfactorily reproduce observed concentrations. In coastal regions macroalgae are thought to be the major marine sources (Manley et al. 1992; Nightingale et al. 1995; Carpenter and Liss 2000) of bromocarbons, while anthropogenic contamination by industrial or municipal effluents may overwhelm the natural sources in some areas (Quack and Wallace 2003). While advection of different water masses generally influences the oceanic distribution, oceanic supersaturations of the compounds can also be caused by the advection of coastal waters enriched in macroalgal releases (Carpenter and Liss 2000; Raimund et al. 2011) and emissions from floating macroalgae (Moore and Tokarczyk 1993).

142,1284,0.935,Subseafloor Biosphere Linked To Hydrothermal Systems : Taiga Concept,"The discovery of high-density animal aggregations in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents of the Galapagos Rift (Corliss et al. 1979; Lonsdale 1977) raised many questions for the mechanism to sustain the ecosystem, especially for the source of primary production. Chemosynthesis of prokaryotes, depending on the inorganic chemical reaction between hydrothermal fluid and seawater, has been recognized major energy source of primary production in the hydrothermal ecosystems (Jannasch and Mottl 1985; Karl et al. 1980). Growth rate of microbial community in hydrothermal system is most useful data to qualify a primary production by chemosynthesis. Potential chemical energy for the chemolithoautotrophic growth has been calculated by chemical thermodynamics based on geochemical data of hydrothermal fluids (Amend and Shock 1998; Jannasch and Mottl 1985; McCollom 2000; McCollom and Shock 1997; Schmidt et al. 2008). The primary production based on chemical energy sustains the huge biomass in megafauna and their rapid growth rate, for examples, 85 cm/year determined by tube length of Riftia pachyptila (Lutz et al. 1994), 10 cm/year growth and long lived of Lamellibrachia sp. (Bergquist et al. 2000), a biomass of the mussel bed exceeded 70 kg/m2 of weight at Logatchev area (Gebruk et al. 2000). The biomass of endosymbiotic bacteria in such invertebrates determined by quinone biomarker suggested sustainable power of chemosynthetic primary production (Yamamoto et al. 2002), despite no data of microbial growth rate directly measured from the symbionts. Investigation of in situ growth of free-living microbial community in ocean habitats is difficult yet due to the nonculturable or slow growing physiology in majority of marine prokaryotes. Several parameters without traditional cultivation methods have been used to estimate microbial growth rate, e.g. microscopic cell density and cell size, adenosine 50 triphosphate (ATP), assimilation rate of isotope labeled substrates (Karl et al. 1980; Kirchman 2001; Malmstrom et al. 2005; Torrton and Dufour 1996), microbial mat formation based on time-series observation (Taylor et al. 1999), frequency of dividing cells (Newell and Christian 1981), macromolecular synthesis (Torrton and Dufour 1996), whole-genome microarray analysis (Holmes et al. 2013). These methods were applied in the hydrothermal environments (Jannasch and Mottl 1985; Karl et al. 1980) as well as general oceanic environments, and the calibration methods to convert growth rate or doubling time from these parameters have been developed (Kirchman 2001; Sherr et al. 1999; Torrton and Dufour 1996; Yokokawa et al. 2004). Another technical issue to determine microbial growth rate in deep-sea hydrothermal vent is an incubation method under"

Gas transport within sea ice is therefore possible as observed by (Gosink et al. 1976) who reported CO2 and SF6 diffusion in sea ice at 7  C. More recently, Loose et al.

However, it must be borne in mind that sea ice covers about 7 % of the Earth surface at its maximal seasonal extent and represents one of the largest biomes on Earth. Even though fluxes through sea ice are modest, integrated over the global sea ice cover can potentially be significant (Delille et al. 2006). Several studies reported measurements of direct air-ice CO2 exchanges. Most studies reported air-ice CO2 fluxes in spring and summer (Delille et al. 2006; Semiletov et al. 2004; Zemmelink et al. 2006; Nomura et al. 2010a, b; Papakyriakou and Miller 2011). Strikingly, some studies reported air-ice CO2 exchange during the winter season when the air-ice interface is supposed to be impermeable to gas exchanges (Heinesch et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2011). Indeed, despite the fact that sea ice can be seen as an ideal environment for micro-meteorological measurement of CO2 fluxes (Loose et al. 2011a) since the surface is relatively smooth and levelled, air-ice CO2 fluxes measurements are still in their infancy. Different methods are used, without inter-comparison, and temporal and spatial coverage is scarce. In addition, the early studies of Semiletov et al. (2004) and Zemmelink et al. (2006) should be considered cautiously as they do not take into account bias of open path sensor CO2 analysers in cold environments, as pointed out by Burba et al. (2008). For the time being, sea ice heterogeneity, gaps in understanding of sea ice biogeochemistry, poor understanding of the role of snow in controlling air-ice gas fluxes and poor temporal and spatial coverage prevent robust integration of air-ice gas fluxes at large scale. Further studies are required to provide such assessments."

260,58,0.934,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Although ranaviruses infecting freshwater fishes are relatively well characterized, less is known about the significance of ranaviruses infecting cultured or feral populations of marine fishes. Exceptions include two related ranaviruses, SGIV and GIV, which significantly impact grouper mariculture in Asia (Chua et al. 1994; Murali et al. 2002; Qin et al. 2003). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 26 conserved iridovirus genes demonstrated that GIV and SGIV are each other√¢¬Ä¬ôs closest relatives; however, these viruses are genetically divergent from other ranaviruses (Eaton et al. 2007). Therefore, GIV/SGIV may need to be considered as a new genus within the family Iridoviridae (Jancovich et al. 2015). SGIV was first identified following a mass mortality event of net-cage farmed brown-spotted grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) in Singapore in 1994 (Chua et al. 1994). The authors referred to the epizootic as Sleepy Grouper Disease; however, they failed to isolate or genetically characterize the virus. In 1998, the same disease was again observed in Singapore farms following imports of brown-spotted grouper fry from Taiwan (Qin et al. 2003). These authors genetically characterized the virus as a novel ranavirus, and named it SGIV (Qin et al. 2003). Similarly, GIV has negatively impacted production of yellow grouper (Epinephelus awoara) in Taiwan (Murali et al. 2002). Delivery of the virus to yellow grouper by injection resulted in 100 % mortality during experimental challenges (Murali et al. 2002). A recent study reported the isolation of SGIV and GIV strains from grouper and non-grouper species cultured in Taiwan (Huang et al. 2011, Table 3). This study illustrates the apparent expanding host range of SGIV/GIV including the first isolation of these viruses in freshwater (largemouth bass) and catadromous (barramundi) fishes. Other partially characterized ranaviruses from wild marine fishes include cod ranavirus (CoIV) isolated from Danish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; Ariel et al. 2010) and the short-finned eel ranavirus (SERV) isolated from short-finned eel (Anguilla australis) off the coast of New Zealand (Bang-Jensen et al. 2009). Ranaviruses isolated from seemingly healthy cultivated freshwater and marine fishes include the pike-perch iridovirus (PPIV) isolated from Finnish pike-perch fingerlings (Tapiovaara et al. 1998) and Ranavirus maxima (Rmax) isolated from Danish turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) fry (Ariel et al. 2010). Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of these fish viruses have revealed they represent previously unknown ranaviruses, warranting more comprehensive study into their biology and potential impact on cultivated and wild populations (Holopainen et al. 2009; Jancovich et al. 2015)."

An important constraint of these algorithms is that, at typical non-bloom concentrations, the PIC scattering represents only a few percent of the total scattering. Thus, to maximise the signal to noise ratio, satellite pixels must be aggregated in space and time, in order to define accurate mean concentrations. Currently, more verification with PIC field measurements is underway to optimise the use of PIC ocean-colour data in models (Balch et al. 2011). PIC is also produced by certain zooplanktonic organisms but these particles are too large to be detected by ocean colour (Balch et al. 1996). Different bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use ocean colour data to identify and differentiate between PFTs or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) in the surface ocean. These can be summarised into four main types: spectral-response methods which are based on differences in the shape of the light reflectance/absorption spectrum for different PFTs/PSCs (Sathyendranath et al. 2004; Alvain et al. 2005, 2008; Ciotti and Bricaud 2006; Bracher et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2011; Brewin et al. 2010a; Devred et al. 2011), methods which use information on the magnitude of chlorophyll a biomass or light absorption to distinguish between PFTs or PSCs (Devred et al. 2006; Uitz et al. 2006; Hirata et al. 2008; Brewin et al. 2010b; Hirata et al. 2011; Mouw and Yoder 2010), methods that retrieve the particle size distribution from satellite-derived backscattering signal and derive PSCs (Kostadinov et al. 2010), and ecological-based approaches which use information on environmental factors, such as temperature and wind stress, to supplement the bio-optical data for investigating PFTs (Raitsos et al. 2008). All methods derive dominant phytoplankton groups, while Uitz et al. (2006), Bracher et al. (2009, improved by Sadeghi et al. 2011) and Hirata et al. (2011) also give chl a for the different PFTs. Nearly all the PFT methods mentioned use information from the multispectral ocean colour sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS or MODIS and are based on the parameterisation of a large global or regional in situ data set in order to yield PFTs from satellite chl a or normalised water leaving radiances. Unexpected changes in the relationships between these parameters resulting from a regional or temporal sampling bias leads to a bias in the"

Recent geochemical and bio-incubation experiments have shown that volcanic ash rapidly releases sufficient amounts of nutrients into seawater that are potentially bio-available for phytoplankton production and growth (Frogner et al. 2001; Duggen et al. 2007; Jones and Gislason 2008; Hamme et al. 2010; Langmann et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2011; Olgun et al. 2011). Atmospheric impacts of other volcanic products such as the sulphate aerosols are discussed in Sect. 4.2.3.5 of Chap. 4. The North Pacific, especially the subarctic region, is a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean region where phytoplankton growth is known to be limited by iron (Martin and Fitzwater 1988; Boyd et al. 1996; Boyd and Harrison 1999) and sporadically by silicate (Wong and Matear 1999; Whitney et al. 2005). Episodic increases of Asian mineral dust input have been observed to increase primary production in the North Pacific (Young et al. 1991). The causal connection between aeolian iron input and diatom production over longer time-scales (e.g. Quaternary) was also indicated by sediment core studies (McDonald and Pedersen 1999). In the North Pacific, volcanic ash is one of the major iron sources, due to the high flux of ash"

As delta regions are particularly sensitive to precipitation and river runoff, outputs from an integrated catchment model (see Chap. 13 and Whitehead et al. 2015a, b) were used to determine run-off and associated nutrient loadings from the delta rivers into the Bay of Bengal. The model took account of both climatic scenarios (Q0, Q8, Q16) and patterns of upstream water use according to three socio-economic scenarios (Less Sustainable (LS), Business As Usual, (BAU), More Sustainable (MS)) scenarios (Whitehead et al. 2015a, b). The results of the Q0-BAU, Q8-LS and Q16-MS were used in further simulations. A regional POLCOMS-ERSEM coupled model (Holt et al. 2009; Butensch√É¬∂n et al. 2016) was used to project both the physical state of the ocean (temperature, salinity, currents, light level), as well as the biogeochemistry and plankton production in the Bay of Bengal (see Chap. 14). The model simulates the dynamics of nutrients (C, P, N and Si), phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria, as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter. The model domain covers the entire coastal area of Bangladesh up to 200 km beyond the edge of the continental shelf, with a horizontal resolution of 0.1√Ç¬∞ and 42 vertical levels. For each climate dataset, the model was run continuously for 1971√¢¬Ä¬ì2099. Outputs from the POLCOMS-ERSEM model were then used to drive a dynamic marine ecosystem model that predicts potential production by size class of fish, taking into account food availability, predation effects and temperature effects on feeding and mortality (Blanchard et al. 2012). Size-based methods like this are useful in that they capture the basic metabolic properties and dynamics of marine food webs, describing energy flux and production by size class, independent of species√¢¬Ä¬ô ecology (Blanchard et al. 2012). To make specific projections for key species, however, a second model, called SS-DBEM, was used (Fernandes et al. 2013, 2016, 2017), which projects changes in species distribution and abundance over time while explicitly considering changes in production, dispersal and physiology as a result of changing ocean conditions, as well as species interactions (Fernandes et al. 2013).

Spatial studies of species turnover (√é¬≤-diversity), in the transition zone between the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat and the Belt Sea (Josefson 2009) and along the salinity gradients of the Baltic Sea (Laine et al. 1997; Bleich et al. 2011; Villn√É¬§s and Norkko 2011), all demonstrate the key role of salinity in the distribution of macrobenthic animals.

Analysis of microbial community structures (Dick and Tebo 2010; Dick et al. 2013; Sunamura et al. 2004) and metagenome/transcriptome (Anantharamana et al. 2013; Dick et al. 2013; Lesniewski et al. 2012) also has shown sulfur oxidation, ammonium oxidation, aerobic methane oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, and heterotrophic activity in the plumes. Microbial community structures based on SSU rRNA genes in the plumes have been studied in MOR hydrothermal systems including, for example, Guaymas Basin (Dick and Tebo 2010), Juan de Fuca Ridge (Lam et al. 2008) at the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Mid Cayman (German et al. 2010) at the Mid Cayman Rise, and Kairei Field (Noguchi et al. Chap. 15) at the Central Indian Oceanic Ridge (CIR). These hydrothermal fields are categorized into methane, sulfur, and hydrogen TAIGA fields. In contrast, there has been little study related to microbial communities in arc/backarc hydrothermal systems in subduction region. Only a hydrothermal plume at the Suiyo Seamount (Sunamura et al. 2004) located on the Izu-Ogasawara Arc has been studied. Figure 3.1 shows the microbial community structures in the plume of arc/backarc hydrothermal system, which we collected and analyzed as a representative of methane and sulfur TAIGA. The key microbial lineages in hydrothermal plumes are selected based on a review paper of microbial studies in hydrothermal plumes and anoxic seawater (Dick et al. 2013). In these key microbial linages, the SUP05 phylotype is recognized as the most abundant and universal species in deep-sea hydrothermal plumes of all over the world. The SUP05 phylotype in these plumes was first documented in the Suiyo Seamount hydrothermal plume (Sunamura et al. 2004), and the SUP05 phylotype has been found to be dominant in many anoxic seawater sites (Lavik et al. 2009; Walsh et al. 2009) all over the world. SUP05 is known to be a close relative to symbionts of hydrothermal chemosynthetic mytilids and vesicomyids (Duperron et al. 2005; Fujiwara et al. 2000). These can grow chemolithoautotrophically with sulfur (Marshall and Morris 2012; Walsh et al. 2009) or H2 (Anantharamana et al. 2013; Petersen et al. 2011) as an electron donor, and oxygen or nitrate as an electron acceptor. The representative isolate of SUP05 grow with thiosulfate, which is accumulated as native sulfur vesicles in a cell and, in addition to sulfur compounds, it can grow heterotrophically (Marshall and Morris 2012). This wide variation of energy and carbon metabolism may sustain SUP05 as the primary key species in hydrothermal plume microbial communities. We also found abundant Alcanivorax, SAR324, and several epsilon proteobacterial phylotypes in the plume microbial community. The lineages"
241,923,0.932,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(Cramp and Simmons 1977; Pihl et al. 1995; Gilissen et al. 2002). A minor component of the Finnish and Swedish populations of some coastal birds remains in the northern Baltic Sea (Gilissen et al. 2002). Winter severity in the Baltic Sea reflects winter severity in the North Sea and further off the coast of western Europe, as well as in central Europe (Hurrell 1995). Winter severity in western Europe affects the non-breeding survival of several coastal birds and seabirds (Nilsson 1984; Koskinen et al. 2003). In addition to mortality from starvation and cold, severe winters may force birds to migrate further than normal and this incurs extra energy costs. Furthermore, when the Baltic Sea is largely ice-covered, seabirds are forced to feed in small open areas which increases competition for food and possibly the risk of disease (Grenquist 1965; Hario et al. 1995). Climate change affects the arrival and departure times of migrants (Forchhammer et al. 2002; Jonz√É¬©n et al. 2002; H√É¬ºppop and H√É¬ºppop 2003; Lehikoinen et al. 2004; Lehikoinen and Sparks 2010; Lehikoinen and Jaatinen 2011) and the timing of breeding (Forchhammer et al. 1998; Both and Visser 2001; M√É¬∏ller 2002; Sanz 2002). A mismatch between hatching time and resource availability has been observed in passerines (e.g. pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Both et al. 2006) as well as in ducks (Oja and P√É¬∂ys√É¬§ 2007). Trophic mismatches may cause population declines particularly in long-distance migrants in seasonal habitats (Both et al. 2010). In addition to trophic constraints, longdistance migrants may suffer from increasing competitive pressure by residents and short-distance migrants along with climate change, contributing to population declines in longdistance migrants (Lemoine and B√É¬∂hning-Gaese 2003). Climate change may also drive changes in migratory routes, stopover sites and migratory tendencies within species and populations. For instance, delayed departure from breeding areas may be the cause of recently observed northward shifts in wintering ducks (Lehikoinen and Jaatinen 2011). Milder winters may allow birds to winter closer to breeding grounds and thus contribute to higher survival, which has been proposed for the mallard (Gunnarsson et al. 2012). However, temperature may be less important in shaping the wintering distributions of European dabbling ducks than factors such as feeding ecology (Dalby et al. 2013). Species ranges are expected to move poleward with climate change (Thomas and Lennon 1999; Hickling et al. 2006), and this has already been shown for the breeding ranges of central European and Arctic birds (Brommer et al. 2012). More study species (41; 69 %) shifted their range margin northwards than southwards (18; 31 %) (√é¬ß2, p = 0.00275). Only a few range margin shifts were greater than three grid squares. An example of a species with a large shift in the southern border northward is the ruff Philomachus pugnax. Large shifts in the northern border occurred in coot, mute swan, common eider, razorbill and Arctic skua"

Similarly, surface water fCO2 in the Southern Indian Ocean (south of 20 S) increased more rapidly (2.11  0.07 √é¬ºatm year 1) than did tropospheric CO2 (1.72 √é¬ºatm year 1) between 1991 and 2007 (Metzl 2009). Regional and temporal differences in the rate of increase of surface water fCO2 are not well understood but have been attributed to changes in seawater buffer capacity (Thomas et al. 2007), mixing and stratification (Schuster and Watson 2007), temperature (Corbie√å¬Äre et al. 2007), biological activity (Lefe√å¬Ävre et al. 2004) and lateral and vertical water transport (Takahashi et al. 2009). The expanding database for fCO2 highlights considerable year-to-year and multi-year variations in ocean carbon cycling. Theory and biogeochemical models predict an increase in air-sea fCO2 disequilibrium over time in high latitude regions. Here water from the interior ocean reaches the surface. This water has a relatively low DIC content, as it equilibrated with an atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio below the present one, when the water last was at the surface. One might expect that the increase in surface water fCO2 of these waters lags the increase in tropospheric CO2 (Takahashi et al. 1997, 2002), given the long equilibration time for CO2 of almost a year. Such an increase in the air-sea fCO2 disequilibrium would be accompanied by an increase in the net oceanic CO2 sink. However, the observation that surface water fCO2 in some regions of the Southern Ocean is currently increasing more rapidly than tropospheric CO2 (Metzl 2009; Takahashi et al. 2009) runs counter to these predictions. Air-sea CO2 flux estimates derived from the inversion of tropospheric CO2 data suggest that this may be a more wide-spread phenomenon in the Southern Ocean, extending to the entire region south of 45 S (Le Que√å¬Åre√å¬Å et al. 2007). This hypothesis of a weakening relative sink strength in the Southern Ocean is supported by several ocean modelling studies (Wetzel et al. 2005; Le Que√å¬Åre√å¬Å et al. 2007; Lovenduski et al. 2007) and is attributed to a trend of increasing Southern Ocean wind speeds, which enhance the upwelling of deeper waters with high concentrations of √¢¬Ä¬únatural√¢¬Ä¬ù DIC (Lovenduski et al. 2008). The changing wind regime may be related to a strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode in response to increasing greenhouse gases and the depletion of stratospheric ozone"

In shallow water (0 and 50-m depth), high concentrations of 134Cs and 137Cs were observed north of the KE, but low concentrations were observed in the KE and south of the KE, which is consistent with previous studies showing that the KE prevented the southward dispersion of radioactive Cs from the FNPP in the surface water (Sect. 2.3; Aoyama et al. 2013a, b; Buesseler et al. 2012). Our results showed that deeper intrusion of FNPP-derived radioactive Cs occurred at 34√Ç¬∞30√¢¬Ä¬≤N and 35√Ç¬∞30√¢¬Ä¬≤N in October 2011 before the first winter after the FNPP accident. In October 2011, the subsurface peak of 134Cs was observed from 24.0 to 26.5 √è¬É√é¬∏. Observations at 34√Ç¬∞30√¢¬Ä¬≤N in November 2012 were between 25.1 and 26.1 √è¬É√é¬∏ with a peak at 25.3 √è¬É√é¬∏. The difference in the density of subsurface 134Cs waters may indicate that different water masses of FNPP-derived radioactive Cs existed during these 2 years. The large spatial variation of the FNPP-derived radioactive Cs around the KE was also discussed with data obtained at 34√Ç¬∞46√¢¬Ä¬≤N√¢¬Ä¬ì148√Ç¬∞52√¢¬Ä¬≤E in February 2012 (Kumamoto et al. 2013). Rypina et al. (2013) reported model results of FNPP-derived radioactive Cs in the area of 34√Ç¬∞N√¢¬Ä¬ì37√Ç¬∞N, 142√Ç¬∞E√¢¬Ä¬ì147√Ç¬∞E during March and June 2011. The three-dimensional (3-D) model results (fig. 9 of Rypina et al. 2013) suggested that FNPP-derived Cs occasionally penetrated to 300√¢¬Ä¬ì400 m in depth north of the KE during April and June 2011 as a consequence of the spatial heterogeneity of mixed-layer depth and the existence of strong downwelling regions. Furthermore, Oikawa et al. (2013) showed data obtained near the FNPP during March 2011 and February 2012, which were part of the monitoring program initiated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). They concluded that the depth of √è¬Ét isopycnals of 25.5√¢¬Ä¬ì26.5 waters increased with time and transported the FNPP-derived radioactive Cs to deep water from the FNPP-proximal coastal waters between May and December 2011. Taking into account the monitoring data of MEXT (Oikawa et al. 2013), the observational data from February 2012 (Kumamoto et al. 2013), and model results (Rypina et al. 2013), it has been suggested that the subsurface peak of radioactive Cs observed south of and in the KE in October 2011 may have been transported from the coastal area off the FNPP without subduction."

Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall in Florida and Louisiana in late August 1992, removed sections of salt marsh and deposited them in shallow ponds and bays (Cahoon 2006). Hurricane Katrina similarly impacted brackish marshes east of the Mississippi River resulting in more than 80 ha (200 acres) of land loss (Morton and Barras 2011). Sediment and wrack deposition during hurricanes can bury marsh vegetation and result in plant mortality (Guntenspergen et al. 1995; Valiela and Rietsma 1995). Also, saltwater intrusion in lower salinity coastal marshes disrupts system ecology, resulting in short-term vegetation dieback (Cahoon 2006). In contrast to the negative effects of hurricanes and storms, hurricane-generated sediment input can counterbalance relative sea-level rise and promote wetland sustainability (McKee and Cherry 2009). In addition, bare patches resulting from wrack deposition allow for the recruitment of other plant species, generating habitat heterogeneity and increasing plant diversity (Guntenspergen et al. 1995). Mangrove forests in Florida have been periodically disturbed by hurricanes, such as Hurricane Donna in 1960 (Craighead and Gilbert 1962), Hurricane Andrew in 1992 (Smith et al. 1994; Baldwin et al. 1995), and Hurricane Wilma in 2006 (Whelan et al. 2009). These and other studies have documented the impacts of such storms on subsequent structure and function of mangrove forests, including defoliation and losses of branches or entire trees (Davis 1995; Baldwin et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2004; Milbrandt et al. 2006; Profitt et al. 2006; Ward et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009; Whelan et al. 2009; Castaneda-Moya et al. 2010; Harris et al. 2010). Recovery of mangroves after hurricane disturbance is a function of a complex interaction of factors, including seedling recruitment and survival, resprouting capability, and colonization by herbaceous vegetation (Baldwin et al. 2001). Post-disturbance site productivity (Ross et al. 2006) and spatial variation in hurricane impact (Thaxton et al. 2007) further influence regeneration success. Recovery of ecological structure generally occurs, but it is a relatively slow process compared to herbaceous systems. Hurricane damage to seagrass beds can be highly variable and depends on location as well as hurricane characteristics (Smith et al. 1994; Courtemanche et al. 1999; Paerl et al. 2001; Coles and Brown 2007; Cebria√å¬Ån et al. 2008; Anton et al. 2009). Hurricanes have been observed to cause widespread damage to seagrasses, but also to pass with little or no damage (Poiner et al. 1989; Hemminga and Duarte 2000). For example, a cyclone and its associated rainfall caused a loss of approximately 1,000 km2 (247,000 ac) of seagrass in Hervey Bay, Australia (Preen et al. 1995). Other reports have shown hurricanes having only small impacts on seagrass beds and associated macrophytes (Fourqurean and Rutten 2004; Tilmant et al. 1994). Hurricane Katrina was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history, with winds over 264 km/h (164 mi/h) and a storm surge of 7.8 to 8.5 m (25.6 to 27.9 ft) in the western coast of Mississippi (Hsu et al. 2005). Anton et al. (2009) showed that this powerful hurricane had no major impact on seagrass density, biomass, or community structure (abundance of producers and consumers) in a seagrass bed located approximately 100 km (62 mi) to the east of the hurricane√¢¬Ä¬ôs landfall. Overall, this research showed that natural temporal changes in seagrass metabolism, recorded before the hurricane, were larger than any post-storm changes. Conversely, a combination of tropical storm activity and higher-than-average watershed discharge in the Big Bend area of Florida is believed to have caused severe reductions in seagrass distribution and abundance up to 2005; absence of storm activity and relatively low river"

The Ryukyu Arc marks the convergent margin of the Eurasia and Philippine Sea Plates. The mid-Okinawa Trough is situated at the transitional settings between the shallow northern Okinawa Trough and the deep southern Okinawa Trough (Fig. 28.1a), in association with the occurrences of en echelon aligned intra-trough √¢¬Ä¬úgrabens√¢¬Ä¬ù (Kimura 1990). One such feature is the Iheya Graben (Iheya Depression/Iheya Deep (Ueda et al. 1985; Kimura et al. 1987)), an ENE-WSW elongated depression situated at the mid-Okinawa Trough (Fig. 28.1c). The Iheya Graben is 100 km long and 200 m deep when compared with the adjacent trough floor (Fig. 28.1c). Numerous volcanic knolls and active hydrothermal sites are distributed along the Iheya Graben and its vicinities, including the Iheya-North Knoll, the CLAM site of Iheya Ridge, and the Izena Hole (Glasby and Notsu 2003). Sibuet et al. (1987) inferred that the migration of the volcanic front into the back-arc basin resulted such an extensive volcanism in the region. The Okinawa Trough is considered to be the only present representation of a submerged marginal rift in the nascent stage (Letouzey and Kimura 1986). However, the detailed structure and evolution of the Okinawa Trough still remains unveiled. Several seismic studies have been conducted since the 1970s to investigate these questions (Lee et al. 1980; Letouzey and Kimura 1986), however the recent surveys with modern advanced equipments were only conducted at the southern part of the Okinawa Trough (Furukawa et al. 1991; Sibuet et al. 1998; Park et al. 1998). Recent implications with other approaches such as geomagnetic (Miki 1995), paleostress (Otubo and Hayashi 2003), and coral reef studies (Iryu et al. 2006) indicate that the Okinawa Trough has experienced geographically heterogenetic evolution in multiple stages (Ishibashi et al., Chap. 27).

241,886,0.93,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"15.5.2.2 Sea The dif√Ø¬¨¬Åculty in making in-site direct aerosol particle dry deposition observations over water derives principally from the following: (i) the bidirectionality of the flux (i.e. the surface acts as both a source and sink for particles), (ii) challenges in making direct size and composition resolved measurements with suf√Ø¬¨¬Åcient time resolution to allow application of micrometeorological techniques and (iii) the typically low turbulence intensity (which both suppresses vertical transport and can challenge flux detection) (Pryor et al. 2008a). For this reason, the overwhelming majority of studies focused on aerosol particle atmosphere√¢¬Ä¬ìsurface exchange (including those focused on nutrient supply) continue to take time-averaged measurements of aerosol particle size and composition and apply a parameterised model of the dry deposition rate to determine the deposition flux (e.g. Matsumoto et al. 2009; Buck et al. 2010; Uematsu et al. 2010).

The input data refer to both the inorganic and organic forms of N and P. Whereas the inorganic species are readily available for biological production, it is still an open question how much of the organic fraction is bioavailable and thus contributes to eutrophication. A summary of an input estimate (HELCOM 2005) based on 2000 data was given in the √Ø¬¨¬Årst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea (BACC Author Team 2008). An updated estimate based on data for 2001√¢¬Ä¬ì2006 was recently published (HELCOM 2011). According to this later report, the annual waterborne inputs are 641,000 t N year√¢¬à¬í1 and 28,700 t P year√¢¬à¬í1. Adding an atmospheric deposition of 198,000 t N year√¢¬à¬í1 (Bartnicki et al. 2011) yields a total N input to the Baltic Sea of 840,000 t N year√¢¬à¬í1 (Table 18.1). According to HELCOM (2011), the atmospheric P deposition contributes 5 % to the total P input (1500 t P year√¢¬à¬í1) resulting in a total input of 30,200 t P year√¢¬à¬í1 (Table 18.1). These estimates differ only slightly from the values given in the previous HELCOM (2005) report and presented in the √Ø¬¨¬Årst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea (BACC Author Team 2008).

(2008) reported a link between the variability of NAO and CO2 fluxes for the rest of the North Atlantic, although the heterogeneity makes the nature of the linkage difficult to identify. Modelling studies (Le Que√å¬Åre√å¬Å et al. 2003; McKinley et al. 2004; Friedrich et al. 2006) show that SST is the primary control of North Atlantic subtropical surface pCO2. On a basin-scale, however, CO2 fluxes simulated in the above model studies are not significantly correlated with the NAO index. Chemical buffering of changes in the CO2 concentrations by the large pool of carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Broecker and Peng 1974) has been suggested as one reason for this decoupling. Seawater pCO2 itself is driven by sea surface temperature (SST), mixing (advective and convective) and biology (production/respiration). In the tropical North Atlantic NA, the seasonal pCO2 cycle is strongly coupled to the SST variability. These oligotrophic waters do not support strong biological productivity due to the lack of nutrients (Longhurst 2007). The subtropical regions demonstrate low biological productivity and the seasonal cycle of pCO2 is dominated by temperature changes. The annual amplitude of approximately 40 √é¬ºatm peaks during the summer months, which corresponds to the temperature peak (Takahashi et al. 2009; Telszewski et al. 2009) but is reduced to a certain extent by low primary production. The pCO2 in the subpolar NA is driven by high temperature variability (√é¬îSST ~ 8  C) and high biological productivity. Here the biological productivity during spring and summer has a strong counteracting effect on the temperature driven pCO2 increase during this period (Ko√å¬àrtzinger et al. 2008; Lu√å¬àger et al. 2004)."

255,240,0.93,Railway Ecology,"Introduction Like roads, railroads affect wildlife through direct mortality, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation (van der Grift 1999; Forman et al. 2003; Davenport and Davenport 2006). Direct mortalities result when trains strike wildlife. Strikes can be a signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant source of mortality for some wildlife populations and have been reported for decades (Child 1983; Gundersen et al. 1998; Bertch and Gibeau 2010a). Studies have reported strike rates for large mammals such as grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) (Bertch and Gibeau 2010a, b) and moose (Alces alces) (Child 1983, 1991; Modafferi 1991). In Canada√¢¬Ä¬ôs Rocky Mountain National Parks, train strikes are a leading source of mortality for grizzly bears (0.35 year√¢¬à¬í1) and black bears (1.95 year√¢¬à¬í1), and the second largest source of mortality for deer (Odocoileus spp.), elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Bertch and Gibeau 2010a, b) in the Banff and Yoho National Parks. It is likely that true mortality rates due to train strikes are higher than reported. For example, as few as 50% of strikes with large mammals were reported by standard observers (train engineers) along the Canadian Paci√Ø¬¨¬Åc Railroad (CPR) during a six-year period (Wells et al. 1999). In other cases, strikes may not be reported except when large groups (>450) of wildlife are killed (Chaney 2011) or when strikes occur within protected areas (Waller and Servheen 2005). Long-term data of train strikes along the CPR exist because strikes have been reported to Parks Canada for at least 30 years. However, other railroads may not report or record strikes with such consistency. Studies on roads have analyzed the spatial pattern of road-kills, which showed that these occurred in clusters (Finder et al. 1999; Clevenger et al. 2003; Malo et al. 2004). The spatial pattern of road-kills has been explained by landscape, environmental and infrastructure variables (Finder et al. 1999; Hubbard and Danielson 2000; Gunson et al. 2006; Kassar 2005). These studies have helped inform management actions targeted at reducing road-kills (Clevenger et al. 2001; Grilo et al. 2009). At least √Ø¬¨¬Åve general factors are thought to affect the spatial pattern of road-kills and train strikes (Seiler and Helldin 2006). Along railroads, these include: animal (e.g., wildlife abundance and behavior); train (e.g., train speed and frequency); railroad design (e.g., curvature or alignment); and landscape (e.g., vegetation type) variables (Huber et al. 1998; Bashore et al. 1985; Finder et al. 1999; Seiler and Helldin 2006). Driver behavior variables are largely removed from train strike analyses because trains generally cannot stop or swerve to avoid animals. Landscape variables derived from land cover data have been found to be the best predictors of road-kill rates (Bashore et al. 1985; Finder et al. 1999; Roger and Ramp 2009). We suggest that estimates of relative abundance be used to assess the spatial pattern of road-kills and train strikes. The importance of including wildlife abundance in the analysis of factors contributing to wildlife strikes was demonstrated for moose: strikes coincided with locations of high moose abundance in wintering areas and on migration routes (Gundersen et al. 1998; Ito et al. 2008). Train variables and railroad design, as well as animal abundance, vary along the CPR and may also affect strike rates. If train or railroad variables altered the probability of a strike, the rate of"

For example, on plastic pellets of various types (PET, PVC, polyethylene and polypropylene) that were deployed in a contaminated bay for up to 1 year, neither PCBs, PAHs or metals reached equilibrium for at least 3 months and in several cases did not reach equilibrium within the 1-year time period (Rochman et al. 2013c, 2014a). In the marine environment, the surface properties of the plastic debris consistently change. As plastic debris weathers it gains surface area, generates oxygen groups (increasing polarity; Mato et al. 2001; Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti 2012) and fouls (increasing their charge, roughness and porosity) (Artham et al. 2009)√¢¬Ä¬îall allowing plastic debris to accumulate increasingly larger concentrations of chemical contaminants (Holmes et al. 2012; Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti 2012; Rochman et al. 2013c, 2014a).

Annual and winter precipitation increased by 3 and 17 %, respectively. Spring, summer and autumn precipitation showed little change. Winter run-off increased and spring run-off decreased during the √Ø¬¨¬Ånal decades of the twentieth century with only small changes during summer and autumn. Meilutyt√Ñ¬ó-Barauskien√Ñ¬ó et al.

The use of GIS to support aquaculture development and planning has a long tradition (Kapetsky et al. 1990) and the identi√Ø¬¨¬Åcation of suitable sites for aquaculture has been among the most frequent applications of GIS (Fisher and Rahel 2004). In recent years, the use and relevance of spatial data in supporting informed decision making in MSP has been increasingly demonstrated (Caldow et al. 2015). For instance, the development of GIS data layers to inform MSP includes: the mapping of sensitivity of seabirds to offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014); the assessment of potential whale interactions with shipping (Petruny et al. 2014); the mapping of offshore (Campbell et al. 2014) and inshore (Breen et al. 2015) √Ø¬¨¬Åshing activity; or the mapping of ethnographic information (Sullivan et al. 2015). Decision makers and planners are most likely to require spatial data layers at the development stage of a MSP process, enabling them to explore the data, and develop and evaluate planning scenarios (Stelzenm√É¬ºller et al. 2012)."

Microbial activity in arid lands is limited by available C (Schaeffer et al. 2007); consequently CO2 enrichment may increase C inputs into soil, which then accelerate rates of soil organic N mineralization to increase the availability of inorganic N to plants (Billings et al. 2004; Jin and Evans 2007; Jin et al. 2011). CO2 enrichment may further increase N availability by increasing the biomass and diversity of fungi (Jin and Evans 2010; Nguyen et al. 2011) that utilize recalcitrant soil substrates and by increasing the activities of enzymes involved in N and C cycling (Jin and Evans 2007; Jin et al. 2011). Increased N2 fixation, increased N use efficiency, and increased root foraging for N at elevated atmospheric CO2 also may delay potential decreases in soil N (Luo et al. 2006). The preponderance of evidence indicates that gradual sequestration of N in organic matter will not strongly limit the responses of rangeland plants to climate change drivers."
255,160,0.929,Railway Ecology,"Air Pollution and Emission The emission of gases from traf√Ø¬¨¬Åc constitutes an important source of environmental pollution all over the world (Hofman et al. 2014). These emissions depend mainly on the type of transport and fuel. Potential sources of contaminants associated with railways include diesel exhaust, and the abrasion of brakes, wheels, and rails, as well as dust from the transport of minerals and treated railway ties (Levengood et al. 2015). The main pollutants emitted from the diesel-powered locomotives are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulphur dioxide (SO2), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), particulate matter (PM) and hydrocarbon (HC) (Plakhotnik et al. 2005; Cheng and Yan 2011). Some studies reported higher levels of PM10 (where the subscript indicates the largest diameter of the particles in microns) and PM2.5 near railways, higher than the standard level allowed (Beychok 2011) for the USA, Europe, and Asia (Park and Ha 2008; Kamani et al. 2014). A growing number of monitoring studies have used bioindicator plant species as surrogates of air pollution across railways (e.g., Rani et al. 2006; Hofman et al. 2014). For example, Rani et al. (2006) studied the micromorphology of leaf parts of Croton bonplandianum, Cannabis sativa and Calotropis procera along a gradient of distances from the railway and concluded that the number of stomata and epidermal cells were lower near railways than at 4 kilometers away from the railway. However, no statistical tests were used to evaluate the correlation between railway distance and the number of stomata and epidermal cells. To the best of our knowledge, Rybak and Olejniczak (2013) authored the only published study that measured the accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in animal species. Using Agelenids spider webs to collect dust suspended in the air, they concluded that spiders are ef√Ø¬¨¬Åcient indicators of PAHs in roads, but not in railway viaducts due to heavier traf√Ø¬¨¬Åc in the former."

241,812,0.929,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Glacier inventories are incomplete, but there are an estimated 300,000√¢¬Ä¬ì400,000 glaciers and small ice caps in the world (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Detailed observations of these glaciers are sparse, and this leads to substantial uncertainty in their present-day volume and present-day rates of mass loss. The uncertainty in total volume (Grinsted 2013) will propagate to the projections of the contribution from mountain glaciers and ice caps (Slangen and van de Wal 2011). Some projections of the glacier contribution to global sea-level rise are based on a semi-empirical approach, where mass loss is related to global temperature change (e.g. Meehl et al. 2007). Marzeion et al. (2012) modelled the global glacier response of the globally complete Randolph Glacier Inventory (Arendt et al. 2012) to the CMIP5 ensemble of general circulation models (GCMs).

Recent studies on agricultural streams with high nitrate concentrations indicate that in-stream nitrate removal may not increase proportionately with nitrate availability due to nitrate saturation of the microbial community responsible for denitri√Ø¬¨¬Åcation (Bernot et al. 2006; Herrman et al. 2008). The study by Herrman et al. (2008) suggested a concentration of 2 mg NO3√¢¬Ä¬ìN l√¢¬à¬í1 as a threshold, above which the streams become increasingly saturated with nitrate and export substantial N. Other research has identi√Ø¬¨¬Åed hydraulic retention time (in-stream water residence time) as a key stream characteristic controlling N removal (Valett et al. 1996). In lakes, permanent N retention occurs as denitri√Ø¬¨¬Åcation but also by incorporation in sedimenting organic matter that is permanently buried on the lake bottom (S√É¬∏ndergaard 2007). As for streams, hydraulic retention time is found to be a key factor controlling N retention in lakes (Windolf et al. 1996; S√É¬∏ndergaard 2007; Herrman et al. 2008). On average for 69 Danish lakes, 43 % of the N input was permanently retained (Jensen et al. 1990). Based on data reported by contracting countries, HELCOM (2004) estimated a 30 % N retention of the gross load entering river systems in the Baltic Sea drainage basin. Retention processes for P in rivers, riparian areas and floodplains comprise sorption to suspended solids and bottom sediment, deposition of particulate matter on the river bed, biotic assimilation by algae and macrophytes, and sedimentation on inundated riparian areas and floodplains (Kronvang et al. 1999; P√É¬§rn et al. 2011). Storage of P within the river is often considered a temporary sink only, as the P build-up in biomass and sediment during summer is flushed out during high winter flows (De Witt 1999; Schulz et al. 2003). Permanent in-stream retention was explained by Svendsen et al. (1995) as sorption of DIP to Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides. In-stream net retention is probably of minor importance (Vassiljev and St√É¬•lnacke 2005), whereas P storage by sedimentation on inundated riparian areas and floodplains can be considerable; rates of up to 127 kg P ha√¢¬à¬í1 year√¢¬à¬í1 are reported (review by Hoffmann et al. 2009). In lakes, P retention occurs via sedimentation of particulate-bound forms or via uptake and incorporation of dissolved P by plants and subsequent sedimentation (S√É¬∏ndergaard 2007). In the drainage areas of entire river systems, P retention in lakes is often considered the most important permanent sink (Svendsen et al. 1995; Vassiljev and St√É¬•lnacke 2005). Kronvang et al. (1999) found an average retention of 3 kg P ha√¢¬à¬í1 year√¢¬à¬í1 for 18 shallow Danish lakes. Vassiljev and St√É¬•lnacke (2005) using a model approach estimated lake P retention to be around 30√¢¬Ä¬ì35 % in the 44,000 km2 Lake Peipsi catchment. However, the retention rate in some lakes is currently negative due to high internal P loading from the sediment following a reduction in the external load (Jeppesen et al. 1999). For the Baltic Sea"

Age plays a significant role in pinnipeds, as younger seals are more often entangled than adults (Lucas 1992; Henderson 2001; Hofmeyr et al. 2006). Gannets and many other seabird species use seaweed to build their nests, but are known to frequently incorporate ropes, nets and other anthropogenic debris (Podolski and Kress 1989; Montevecchi 1991; Hartwig et al. 2007; Votier et al. 2011; Bond et al. 2012; Lavers et al. 2013; Verlis et al. 2014) (Fig. 4.1). Marine debris used in nest construction increases the risk of mortal entanglement for both adult birds and chicks (Fig. 4.1). In three of the six North American gannet populations, close to 75 % of the gannet nests contained fishing debris. Its frequency can be linked to the level of gillnet fishing effort in the waters around the colonies (Bond et al. 2012)."

241,407,0.928,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Box 6.2 Observing the cryosphere Observations of snow cover comprise (1) in situ measurements of snow fall, snow depth, SWE and/or snow structure; (2) airborne remote sensing observations; or (3) space-borne satellite observations. In situ observations are normally operated by hydrological and/or meteorological services. They are local in nature and not uniformly distributed. Data quality is affected by, for example, changes in station location and observation methodology. Snow observations have been made operationally in many countries for several decades. The use of satellite observations for studying the cryosphere has been discussed by Sharkov (2003), Nosenko et al. (2005) and Sutyrina (2011). Satellites provide the opportunity to observe large-scale SCE by optical satellite imagery or by radar remote sensing. Snow depth and SWE are derived from data obtained from passive microwave sensors. Cloud cover and highly variable illumination conditions (including the polar night) impede the use of monitoring methods reliant on reflected solar radiation. Dense forest cover and deep snow hinder the use of passive microwave sensors. Studies also reveal signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant differences between remotely sensed and in situ observations of snow cover, for example owing to the algorithms that convert brightness temperatures observed from satellites to SWE. These problems were discussed by Boyarskii et al. (1994), Boyarskii and Tikhonov (2000), Luojus et al. (2009), Kitaev (2010), Mets√É¬§m√É¬§ki et al. (2010) and Kitaev and Titkova (2011). There are sometimes large discrepancies between the satellite data and the ground-based instrumental observations of the snow cover boundary during periods of snow formation and snowmelt. Radar-based remote sensing is problematic during the snowmelt season, and it is dif√Ø¬¨¬Åcult to √Ø¬¨¬Ånd a single method that functions well in mountainous, open and forested areas. The use of wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was promising especially in the boreal zone (Khan et al. 2007; Lemke and Ren 2007; Luojus et al. 2007, 2009). K√É¬§rn√É¬§ et al.

Uncertainty for other air pollutants is controlled more by combustion conditions and installed technologies and their uncertainty is considerably larger, as quoted above for BC. A qualitative indication is that for VOC, NH3 and OC the uncertainty range will be similar to the BC ranges of Bond et al. (2004) while NOx will be in between the SO2 and BC ranges. Global Biomass Burning Emissions Biomass burning emissions are highly variable from year to year as a result of different environmental and human factors. Schultz et al. (2008) provided a detailed literature review on continental scale estimates of biomass burning emissions and constructed a global emissions data set with monthly time resolution for the period 1960√¢¬Ä¬ì2000. The previously discussed ACCMIP historical dataset (Lamarque et al. 2010) provides decadal monthly mean biomass burning emissions, mostly based on Schulz et al. (2008). As can be seen from Table 4.2, biomass burning emissions contribute significantly to total global emissions of aerosols and their precursors but its relevance differs by substance, from being quite modest for SO2 to dominant for OC. Over the past 20 years estimates of biomass burning emissions, including their spatial location, have greatly improved due to the availability of earth observation data from satellites. The activity data detected from space (burned area or fire radiative power) includes all major grassland, savanna, and forest fires (including deforestation fires) (e.g. Van der Werf et al. 2006, 2010; Kloster et al. 2010). To estimate emissions, satellite-derived burned areas (Giglio et al. 2010) drive the fire module of a biogeochemical model that calculates fuel loads for each month and grid cell, which are then combined with emission factors (Andreae and Merlet 2001). A good example of this methodology is the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) which contains emissions from open fires for the 1997√¢¬Ä¬ì2004 period (van der Werf et al. 2006). A new version of the inventory that covers the 1997√¢¬Ä¬ì2009 period, called GFED-v3, was made available at the beginning of 2010 (van der Werf et al. 2010).

Although single remote sensing images are frequently disturbed by cloud coverage, skin layer uncertainties and other factors, the monthly mean SST from the remote sensing data agree well with those from in situ measurements in the offshore sea areas (Siegel et al. 2006; Bradtke et al. 2010). Lehmann et al. (2011) used remote sensing data for 1990√¢¬Ä¬ì2008 to derive a linear trend of annual mean SST of up to 1 √Ç¬∞C per decade in the northern part of the Bothnian Bay, but a high increase was also found in the Gulf of Finland and Gulf of Riga and in the northern Baltic Proper (Fig. 7.2). Warming of surface waters is lowest (0.3√¢¬Ä¬ì0.5 √Ç¬∞C per decade), north-east from Bornholm Island up to and along the Swedish coast, probably due to an increase in the frequency of coastal upwelling (Lehmann et al. 2012). Bradtke et al. (2010) also considered trends in monthly and seasonal mean values during 1986√¢¬Ä¬ì2006 and found the highest positive trend (more than 2 √Ç¬∞C per decade in August) in the Bothnian Sea and the northern Baltic Proper. At the same time, mean SST in March decreased. Siegel et al. (2006) studied the period 1990√¢¬Ä¬ì2004 and found the highest rate of increase in the Bothnian Sea in July (more than 3 √Ç¬∞C per decade), and in the Arkona and Gotland Sea in August and September (about 1.5 √Ç¬∞C per decade). Trends in SST for the past three to four decades based on data from remote sensing generally agree well with trends determined from independent in situ observations of SST. Deep-water temperature in the Baltic Proper is determined mainly by the lateral spread of submerged saline water of North Sea origin, reflecting surface thermal conditions during deep-water formation.

391,466,0.927,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"Analysis of the composition of fossil air trapped in ice cores has extended the tropospheric histories of all three gases, to ~800,000 years before present (YBP) for CO2 (Petit et al. 1999; EPICA community members 2004; Lu√å¬àthi et al. 2008) and to ~650,000 YBP for N2O and CH4 (Spahni et al. 2005). These data show that during the last 650,000 years CO2 has varied from ~170 ppm during glacials to ~280 ppm during interglacials, while during the preceeding 100,000 years the range was somewhat smaller. For comparison, tropospheric CO2 increased from 280 ppm pre-industrially to 389 ppm in 2010 (Forster et al. 2007; WDCGG 2012). Changes in ocean circulation and biology and the feedbacks between them have been invoked to explain the glacial/ interglacial fluctuations of tropospheric CO2 but understanding the precise mechanistic details remains a substantial challenge (Jansen et al. 2007). Over the last 420,000 years, tropospheric CO2 has tracked reconstructed changes in Antarctic temperature with a time lag of several hundred to a thousand years (Mudelsee 2001), implying that changes in the physical climate system such as temperature and the extent of glaciers have initiated changes in the global carbon cycle and tropospheric CO2. The carbon cycle then has responded by amplifying these initial perturbations through positive carbon-climate feedbacks. Today the situation is fundamentally different in that the increasing greenhouse gas content drives changes in climate and environment. Variation in stratospheric N2O between 200 and 280 ppb during the past 650,000 years (Spahni et al. 2005) can be attributed to concurrent natural changes in both the terrestrial and the oceanic sources (Sowers et al. 2003; Flu√å¬àckiger et al. 2004). Since the pre-industrial era the mean tropospheric N2O dry mole fraction has increased from 270  7 to ~323 ppb. The current tropospheric N2O growth rate of about 0.7 ppb year√¢¬Ä¬ì1 can primarily be attributed to the continued increased use of nitrogen fertilisers (Forster et al. 2007; Montzka et al. 2011)."
394,429,0.927,Biotechnologies for Plant Mutation Breeding : Protocols,"Natural and induced mutations are powerful tools for functional genomics and plant breeding. Methods for rapid discovery and genotyping of mutations are important for a variety of applications including marker development, marker-assisted selection, population genetics, and reverse-genetics. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most common type of natural nucleotide variation in plants. While the spectra of mutations induced by treatment with either chemical or physical mutagens vary depending on the mutagen and dosage of mutagen used, many treatments with chemical mutagens produce predominantly SNP or small indel mutations. For example, data collected from Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) projects where species were treated with either ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), sodium azide or a combination of sodium azide, and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) show that these mutagens create predominantly single-base-point mutations (Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2011). Furthermore, treatment with EMS produces greater than 90 % GC to AT transition mutations for many crop species (Greene et al. 2003; Slade and Knauf 2005; Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2011; Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2012). There is a broader diversity of effects reported of plants treated with physical mutagens. For example, fast neutron irradiation of plants has been reported to generate genomic deletions ranging in size from less than 56 base pairs to nearly three million base pairs (Li et al. 2001; Rogers et al. 2009; Bolon et al. 2011; Belfield et al. 2012). The most common mutagen used in the development of the ~3200 officially released mutant crop varieties curated in the IAEA√¢¬Ä¬ôs Mutant Variety Database (http://mvd.iaea.org/) is gamma irradiation. Reports on the type of DNA lesions induced by gamma irradiation are quite variable. In rice, data suggest that >80 % of mutations induced via gamma irradiation are small deletions up to 16 base pairs, with the remainder being large deletions (Sato et al. 2006; Bruce et al. 2009). Yet in maize only deletions greater than 200 kilobases were reported (Yuan et al. 2014). Some caution is needed when trying to draw broad conclusions from these datasets as many technologies employed to discover mutations have strong ascertainment biases. For example, enzymatic mismatch cleavage of PCR products is highly efficient for discovery of SNPs and deletions of up to approximately 50 base pairs, but variations involving a larger number of nucleotides go undetected (Till et al. 2003; Comai et al. 2004). Discovery of large insertions and deletions requires more technically complex and expensive approaches (Bolon et al. 2011; Henry et al. 2014). Enzymatic-based approaches for the discovery and characterization of smaller nucleotide variation date back to the 1970s. A class of enzymes known as singlestrand-specific nucleases was first shown to preferentially cleave single-stranded regions of otherwise doubled-stranded DNA (Shenk et al. 1975; Kroeker and Kowalski 1978; Desai and Shankar 2003). By the late 1990s, PCR and capillary Sanger sequencing allowed direct identification of single-nucleotide variation. This remains cost prohibitive for large-scale screening, and assignment of heterozygous indels using this technique is challenging. In 1998, a single-strand-specific nuclease"

Although the microbiological characterizations have not fully justified the formation of unique chemolithotrophic communities in the Okinawa Trough deep-sea hydrothermal systems, the development of a great phylogenetic and physiological diversity of chemolithotrophic microbial communities has been demonstrated by the previous cultivation-dependent and even the molecular ecological methods (Nakagawa et al. 2005; Nunoura and Takai 2009; Takai et al. 2006). However, these implications have been based only on the results of microbiological characterizations in two hydrothermal systems, Iheya North (Iheya North Knoll) and Yonaguni Knoll IV (Daiyon-Yonaguni Knoll) fields of the Okinawa Trough. The Okinawa Trough is a √¢¬Ä¬úrifting phase√¢¬Ä¬ù of Backarc Basin covered with thick terrigenous sediments (Letouzey and Kimura 1986) and is now known to host seven active deep-sea hydrothermal fields, of which the seafloor hydrothermal activities have been verified by the seafloor observation and the hydrothermal fluid and mineral samples have been investigated (Glasby and Notsu 2003; Ishibashi et al. Chap. 27). The Izena Hole Jade and Hakurei fields and the Iheya Ridge Clam field were discovered in the late 1980s, the Minami-Ensei (Minami-Ensei Knoll) field in 1990, the Iheya North field in 1995, and finally the Yonaguni Knoll IV field and the Hatoma Knoll fields were explored in 1999 (Glasby and Notsu 2003; Ishibashi et al. Chap. 27). Since the discovery of these Okinawa Trough hydrothermal systems, more than 300 dives of manned submersibles and remotely operative vehicles have been organized, and the geochemical analyses of hydrothermal fluids and mineral deposits and the microbiological characterizations have been extensively conducted (Glasby and Notsu 2003; Ishibashi et al. Chap. 27). At present, the detail physical and chemical characteristics of hydrothermal fluids have been determined in the Iheya North field (Kawagucci et al. 2011), the Yonaguni Knoll IV field (Konno et al. 2006; Suzuki et al. 2008), the Minami-Ensei field (Kawagucci et al. 2013) and the Izena Hole Jade and Hakurei fields (Ishibashi et al. 2014; some data summarized in Kawagucci Chap. 30). Thus, if the compositions and functions of microbial communities in the chimney habitats are characterized with a combination of the detail physical and chemical characteristics of the proximal hydrothermal fluids, the new data provide important insights into understanding the inter-fields and intra-field features of microbial community development patterns and geochemical-microbial interrelation in the Okinawa Trough hydrothermal systems. In this chapter, we show the microbial community patterns in the chimney habitats characterized mainly by using culture-dependent techniques in the Minami-Ensei, Izena Hole Jade and Hakurei fields of the Okinawa Trough. The overall comparison of the microbial community patterns points to the conventional and"

Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence of the formation of secondary organic aerosol on dust in these studies. If carboxylic acids are the most common identified organic species in mixing with dust, internal mixing of dust has been observed with MSA (Dall√¢¬Ä¬ôOsto et al. 2010); PAH (Falkovich et al. 2004; Stone et al. 2011); pesticides (Falkovich et al. 2004); fatty acids (Mochida et al. 2007); hopane and levoglucosan (Stone et al. 2011) and organic nitrogen (Dall√¢¬Ä¬ôOsto et al. 2010). The abundant organic matter found on dust surfaces suggests that dust is an excellent medium for long-range transport of pollution in the troposphere (Falkovich et al. 2004). The extent organic compounds coat onto dust depends on the transport pathway, reactivity of organic species, ambient concentration and ambient humidity, notably for high water-soluble species like carboxylic acids (Falkovich et al. 2004; Dall√¢¬Ä¬ôOsto et al. 2010). Sea Salt Sea salt aerosols can also participate in heterogeneous reactions with nitric and sulphuric acids, leading to chloride (and also other halogens like Br) depletion (notably Cl-depletion) through HCl volatilisation and the production of halogen radicals, particularly in relatively polluted marine air (Sturges and Shaw 1993; Johansen et al. 1999; Kumar et al. 2008). The release of reactive chloride is considered to be an important intermediate in the oxidation reactions associated with the removal of light hydrocarbons and ozone in the marine atmosphere (Singh and Kasting 1988; Vogt et al. 1996). The magnitude of Cl-depletion of marine aerosols has been demonstrated to usually increase with decreasing sea salt particle size (Mouri and Okada 1993; Kerminen et al. 1998; Yao et al. 2003; Hsu et al. 2007). This reaction produces sea salt particles coated with sulphate and nitrate over Asian and Pacific areas (Matsumoto et al. 2004; Matsuki et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2009) and in the Mediterranean region (Tursic et al. 2006). In the clean atmosphere, methanesulphonate is the major species involved in chloride depletion as observed in Finland (Kerminen et al. 1998) and in the Arctic (Maskey et al. 2011). The S-containing sea salt particles are generated by reactions of the sea salt particles with MSA and/or H2SO4 from biogenic sources rather than anthropogenic ones. Mixing between sea salt and oxalate is"

A larger increase was obtained from model simulations which yielded a rough doubling of sedimentation since the 1950s (Hansson and Gustafsson 2012) and an almost fourfold increase since 1900 (Gustafsson et al. 2012). Cyanobacteria blooms have occurred in the Baltic Sea since the early brackish Littorina Sea stage (Chap. 2), in particular during hypoxic bottom water conditions (Bianchi et al. 2000). Observations suggest an increase in cyanobacteria after the 1960s (Finni et al. 2001). Furthermore, budgets for CO2 and total N in the surface water of the central Baltic Sea indicated an increase in N √Ø¬¨¬Åxation by cyanobacteria of 30 % within the past two decades (Schneider et al. 2009).

However, the occurrence of Phragmites on the outer portions of the delta is a mixed blessing. On one hand, Phragmites populations stabilize an easily erodible landscape (Rooth and Stevenson 2000) and protect the more diverse and fragile interior marshes of the delta (Hauber et al. 2011). On the other hand, Phragmites populations provide little in the way of habitat and food for migrating waterfowl that overwinter in the Mississippi River delta (Hauber et al. 1991). The Phragmites marshes of the Mississippi River√¢¬Ä¬ôs Birdfoot Delta are unique in that they contain the most phenotypically and genetically diverse Phragmites populations in the world (Hauber et al. 2011).

More recently the interior marshes of the delta have been colonized by at least two other lineages, the Gulf Coast subspecies and the introduced haplotype M, which has Eurasian origins (Hauber et al. 2011).

This observation significantly limits their value to identify robust disease-associated phenotypes by simply comparing patientderived cells with unrelated controls. This system-immanent variability has proven to be particular challenging in the context of age-related diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer√¢¬Ä¬ôs and Parkinson√¢¬Ä¬ôs disease, considering that diseaseassociated phenotypes typically progress slowly over many years in patients, which suggests that expected in vitro phenotypes would be rather mild and subtle. The reasons for the observed cell-to-cell differences include genetic background variations, genetic and epigenetic changes resulting from reprogramming and extended maintenance of hiPSCs and the lack of robust in vitro differentiation protocols (Soldner and Jaenisch 2012; Liang and Zhang 2013). Some of the above-described limitations have been overcome by improved reprogramming and culture conditions (Warren et al. 2010; Hou et al. 2013), directed differentiation approaches including transcription factor-induced reprogramming (Zhang et al. 2013), insertion of cell type-specific fluorescent marker proteins to monitor differentiation (Di Giorgio et al. 2008; Hockemeyer et al. 2009, 2011; Chambers et al. 2012; Mica et al. 2013) or by consortium-size experiments to significantly increase the number of independent experimental samples (The HD iPSC Consortium 2012).

It has two distinct constituents (E and T), which are controlled by different mechanisms. Partitioning of ET is important not only for better understanding the water budget but also for predicting the biogeochemical fluxes driven by hydrological variations (Wang et al. 2010a). Efficient use of the limited water resources in rangelands requires maximizing the productive water loss (T) and minimizing the unproductive water loss (E) (Wang and D√¢¬Ä¬ôOdorico 2008). Separating E from T, however, has always been a difficult task√¢¬Ä¬îespecially from the observational point of view at larger scales. A useful tool for separating E from T is stable isotopes of water, because E and T carry distinct isotopic signatures. Traditionally, the stable isotopic compositions of water samples are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), while the vapor-phase measurements are based on cryogenic water vapor collection coupled with IRMS. Such methods are labor intensive and time consuming. Over the past decade, a revolutionary change has taken place in water isotope measurement: the appearance of spectroscopy-based instruments capable of continuously measuring water vapor isotopic compositions (Fig. 3.7) (Lee et al. 2005; Wen et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009a; Griffis et al. 2010)."

Although our understanding of the underlying processes is limited and quantitative estimates are scarce, the physical processes are thought to result in a net sink for tropospheric CO2 during sea ice formation in the polar oceans. Recently, Rysgaard et al. (2011) estimated the net influx of CO2 into the polar oceans at 33 Tg C year 1, a flux resulting from the rejection of carbon from the ice crystal matrix during winter and subsequent formation of a surface layer of melt-water, undersaturated in CO2 during summer. The sink would be much stronger (83 Tg C year 1), if CaCO3 crystals form in the sea ice. Omar et al. (2005) suggested a wintertime CO2 sink of 5.2 g C m 2 associated with the formation of seasonal sea ice and brine rejection in the Arctic. With a seasonal sea ice extent of 14  106 km2 (in 2005) this translated into a wintertime sink of 36 Tg C year 1, which is on the higher end of estimates of 14 Tg C year 1 (no CaCO3 precipitation) and 31 Tg C year 1 (with CaCO3 precipitation) for the Arctic Ocean by Rysgaard et al. (2011). Sea ice related tropospheric CO2 uptake was estimated as 19 Tg C year 1 for the Southern Ocean, which would increase to 52 Tg C year 1, if CaCO3 crystals form in the ice (Rysgaard et al. 2011). Oceanic CO2 uptake during the seasonal cycle of sea ice growth and decay is thus equivalent to 17√¢¬Ä¬ì42 % of net tropospheric CO2 uptake in ice-free polar seas (Rysgaard et al. 2011)."

The TAIGA project team hypothesize that there are four types of sub-seafloor aquifers (TAIGAs: great rivers in Japanese), which are divided based on their representative chemical energy: compounds of sulfur, carbon (methane), iron, and hydrogen (Urabe et al. 2009; Chap. 1). During the TAIGA project, we study each type of sub-seafloor aquifer, in an attempt to reveal how the geological and tectonic setting controls the hydrothermal activity. The Central Indian Ridge (CIR) is one of the most intensively-studied fields where unique hydrogen-rich hydrothermal vent is known to exist. At present, only four hydrothermal vent fields have been visually confirmed along the CIR; two of which were newly discovered during the TAIGA project. Other plume anomalies have been reported in the water column along the CIR (e.g., Park 2010) and previous German expeditions reported the fossil hydrothermal sites (e.g., Herzig and Pluger 1988; Halbach et al. 1995) The active hydrothermal vent fields are described as follows. The Kairei hydrothermal field (KHF), located at the southernmost CIR near the Rodriguez Triple Junction (RTJ), was the first directly-observed hydrothermal field in the Indian Ocean (Gamo et al. 2001). The KHF is a blacksmoker-type high temperature field, but fluids have an unusually high concentration of H2 (2.5√¢¬Ä¬ì8.5 mmol/kg), despite similarities to typical basalt-hosted mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal fluids in its other mineral and gas element compositions (Van Dover et al. 2001; Gallant and Von Damm 2006; Kumagai et al. 2008). Takai et al. (2004) proposed that the Kairei ecosystem is sustained by the primary production of hydrogenotrophic, hyperthermophilic methanogens, utilizing H2 and CO2 as primary energy and carbon sources. The Edmond field is another high-temperature hydrothermal field located 160 km north of the KHF in the southern CIR (Van Dover et al. 2001). The H2 concentration in the Edmond fluid is markedly low, and in the range of typical basalt-hosted hydrothermal fluids (Gallant and Von Damm 2006; Kumagai et al. 2008). Corresponding to a water-column hydrothermal signal discovered as early as the late eighties and recently (Jean-Baptiste et al. 1992; Kawagucci et al. 2008), two new areas of hydrothermal activity with associated chemosynthetic fauna were newly discovered in 2009 on the CIR at 18√¢¬Ä¬ì20 S (Nakamura et al. 2012).

391,479,0.926,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"The precipitation of CaCO3 leads to a shift from the HCO3 pool to the CO2 pool and a release of CO2 to the surrounding water. The √¢¬Ä¬úreleased√¢¬Ä¬ù CO2 subsequently equilibrates with HCO3 , so that for each mole of CaCO3 precipitated, less than one mole of CO2 is √¢¬Ä¬úreleased√¢¬Ä¬ù. The fraction for average surface sea water is 0.6 (Frankignoulle et al. 1994). Consequently, where the ratio between net organic carbon production or net community production (NCP) and calcification is below 0.6, the waters are a CO2 source and where this ratio exceeds 0.6, they are a CO2 sink (Suzuki and Kawahata 2004). In coral reefs NCP is close to zero (Gattuso et al. 1998). Hence the CO2 √¢¬Ä¬úreleased√¢¬Ä¬ù by CaCO3 precipitation generally exceeds the CO2 drawdown by NCP and coral reefs tend to act as CO2 sources to the troposphere (Gattuso et al. 1993, 1997; Frankignoulle et al. 1996; Ohde and van Woesik 1999; Bates et al. 2001). In the pelagic realm, where the vast majority of calcification is carried out by the coccolithophore component of the phytoplankton (Buitenhuis et al. 1996; Harlay et al. 2010, 2011; Suykens et al. 2010), the average ratio of NCP to net CaCO3 precipitation is between 11 and 16 (Sarmiento et al. 2002; Jin et al. 2006). The net consequence of biological production and the export of organic carbon and CaCO3 from the pelagic realm is a tendency towards CO2 uptake from the troposphere.

Pinto and Keitt (2008) found that the abundances of Sturnira spp. were positively associated with secondary forest cover, reflecting the species√¢¬Ä¬ô preference for early successional vegetation. Conversely, Carollia spp. responded to forest cover that included both primary and secondary forests, implying that habitat connectivity may be more important than successional stage for populations in this genus. As with logged forests, these findings suggest species-specific responses to secondary vegetation linked to interspecific differences in diet, home range size, and body size. Contrary to the flexible responses observed for many frugivores and nectarivores, a large body of empirical evidence indicates that gleaning animalivorous phyllostomines are sensitive to forest degradation, as they are absent or occur at low abundance in secondary regrowth (Fenton et al. 1992; Brosset et al. 1996; Medell√É¬≠n et al. 2000; Faria 2006; Castro-Luna et al. 2007a, b; Mancina et al. 2007; Willig et al. 2007; Pardini et al. 2009; Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010; de la Pe√É¬±aCu√É¬©llar et al. 2012; Vleut et al. 2012, 2013). Some studies have detected a clear pattern of species richness increasing across successional gradients (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009; de la Pe√É¬±a-Cu√É¬©llar et al. 2012), but this pattern has not been evident in others (Castro-Luna et al. 2007a; Mancina et al. 2007). Nonetheless, for Neotropical wet and dry forests, floristically more diverse and structurally more complex habitats harbor greater taxonomic and functional richness than do early or intermediate stages of succession. Here, vegetation complexity appears to be an important factor shaping assemblage composition (Medell√É¬≠n et al. 2000; Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009; Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010; Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012; de la Pe√É¬±a-Cu√É¬©llar et al. 2012). Late successional forest stands often host many bat species not found in earlier stages, in particular rare taxa, and through succession, the number of species and ensembles increases for frugivorous, nectarivorous, and gleaning animalivorous taxa (AvilaCabadilla et al. 2009, 2012; de la Pe√É¬±a-Cu√É¬©llar et al. 2012). In tropical wet forest in Mexico, abundances of the most common bat species were associated positively or negatively with variation in canopy cover across successional stages, rather than with landscape attributes (Castro-Luna et al. 2007a). In contrast, a study in Mexican tropical dry forest found evidence for an important role of local (vegetation complexity) and landscape attributes (area and cover of different vegetation types) as determinants of variation in abundance, which were ensemble specific and scale dependent (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012). In Central Amazonia, gleaning animalivorous phyllostomid bats exhibited greater abundance and richness in Cecropia-dominated regrowth, whereas stenodermatine frugivores were more abundant in abandoned pastures and Vismia-dominated regrowth, demonstrating that different successional trajectories result from differences in land-use history (cutting versus cutting and burning) that lead to distinct differences in bat assemblage composition (Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010). Despite the recovery potential of Neotropical bat assemblages during succession, the conservation value of secondary forests for bats critically hinges"

This is an important consideration as algal CH3I production has been found to vary depending on the species and environmental conditions, such as nutrient-limitation (SmytheWright et al. 2010), grazing (Smythe-Wright et al. 2010), light-levels (Moore et al. 1996b; Laturnus et al. 1998), mechanical damage (Nightingale et al. 1995) and desiccation (Nightingale et al. 1995). The only sources which some studies have suggested could contribute significantly to global or regional CH3I production in the marine environment are photochemistry and cyanobacteria. Richter and Wallace (2004) suggest that 50 % of the average daily flux of CH3I from the tropical Atlantic surface layer could be due to photochemistry. The extrapolation of laboratory production rates suggests that the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus could contribute significantly to CH3I production in the eastern tropical Atlantic (Hughes et al. 2011) and calculations presented in Smythe-Wright et al. (2006) suggest that this organism is also an important global source producing 4.3 Gmol year1. However, orders of magnitude variability in the CH3I production rate have been observed in laboratory cultures of Prochlorococcus between the three studies on this topic published to date (Smythe-Wright et al. 2006; Brownell et al. 2010; Hughes et al. 2011). Hughes et al. (2011) suggest that CH3I production by Prochlorococcus is strongly dependent on cell physiological state. Therefore, the different incubation conditions used in these three studies could explain this variability and should be considered when extrapolating laboratory production rates to the natural environment. Other sources such as bacteria (Amachi et al. 2001; Fuse et al. 2003) and detrital aggregates (Hughes et al. 2008b) are not understood sufficiently to allow accurate global flux estimates to be made. Several mechanisms for CH3I production in seawater have been proposed: 1. A photochemical CH3I source has been suggested to involve a radical recombination pathway (Eq. 1.1, Moore and Zafiriou 1994) but more information on the mechanism is needed. CH3  √É¬æ I"

High concentration levels of heavy metals are often found in the vicinity of railways. Wi√Ö¬Çkomirski et al.

For instance, the concentration of nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and lead in the moss (Pleurozium schreberi) was the same 30 m from the railway as it was at points near the railways (Mazur et al. 2013). In addition, high concentrations of PAHs were found in the aerial parts of plant species near the railway and up to distances of 30 m from the railway (Malawaka and Wilkomirski 2001; Wi√Ö¬Çkomirski et al. 2011).

Among them are the multiple regression (Murphy 1999), the CCA method (Busuioc et al. 1999), and the SVD method (Bretherton et al. 1992). The difference between these approaches is that the multiple regression minimises the root-mean-square errors (distance between predictions and observations), the CCA maximises the correlation, and the SVD maximises the covariance between two √Ø¬¨¬Åelds. Arti√Ø¬¨¬Åcial neural networks also represent nonlinear regression models (Crane and Hewitson 1998). 10.3.2.3 Weather Classification Methods The weather classi√Ø¬¨¬Åcation methods involve various strategies, such as analogues (Zorita and von Storch 1999; Timbal et al. 2008), circulation classi√Ø¬¨¬Åcation schemes (B√É¬°rdossy and Caspary 1990; Jones et al. 1993), cluster analysis (CorteReal et al. 1999; Huth 2000), and neural nets. The analogue model involves searching the record of past events and taking the day that most closely matches the situation wanted to predict. Cluster analysis bases the predictions on a number of closest states (Wilks 1995), either by taking the mean of the days with close matches or by using the observed values for all days that match the predicted state, and constructing a statistical distribution (histogram). From this sample, or a √Ø¬¨¬Åtted probability density distribution, a random value may be drawn. Neural nets involve various adaptive learning algorithms, such as √¢¬Ä¬òarti√Ø¬¨¬Åcial intelligence√¢¬Ä¬ô (Wilby et al. 1998; Hewitson and Crane 2002). The analogue model, circulation classi√Ø¬¨¬Åcation schemes, and cluster analysis all involve a re-sampling of past measurements. These re-sampling techniques suffer from one caveat that the tails of the distributions will be distorted because the sampling cannot produce new record-breaking values (Benestad 2008). Even stationary series are expected to produce new record-breaking events, given suf√Ø¬¨¬Åciently long intervals for observations. Theory of independent and identically distributed (iid) series shows that the expected occurrence of new record-breaking events will converge towards zero, but never actually become zero. Nevertheless, this implies that the upper and lower tails of the distribution of the results from the re-sampling methods may be distorted and that the"

These results necessitate pre-existing chains for every running direction for every position, an unlikely scenario. In another type of network model that is not mutually exclusive with those mentioned, the most excited cells fire first, which drives inhibitory cells to delay the activity of other place cells that code for more distant positions (Dragoi and Buzsa√å¬Åki 2006; Maurer et al. 2006; Geisler et al. 2007; Stark et al. 2013). Silencing of soma-targeting interneurons (Royer et al. 2012), or decoupling retrograde communication between pyramidal and inhibitory cells through endocannabinoid receptor antagonism (Robbe et al. 2006; Robbe and Buzsa√å¬Åki 2009; Losonczy et al. 2010), causes large disruptions in assembly coordination and a redistribution of spiking across theta phase. These findings show a clear role of inhibition in phase precession. Several observations support network models of precession. Place cells show trial-to-trial variance in their firing rates that cannot be explained by changes in position or theta phase alone (La√å¬Ånsky√å¬Å et al. 2001). Statistical models have shown that the precise trial-to-trial timing can be predicted by the spiking activity of other neurons, as would be expected if sequencing was brought about through a chaining of co-active ensembles oscillating faster than the baseline LFP (Harris et al. 2002; Dragoi and Buzsa√å¬Åki 2006; Geisler et al. 2007). However, principal cells respond to many environment stimuli and therefore a misspecification of the model may mistake common external modulation for a causal network interaction (Chadwick et al. 2015). Therefore further experimentation is needed to resolve whether theta sequences truly reflect network level synchronization."

391,740,0.925,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"thus iron limitations occurs (Martin et al. 1991). Therefore, atmospheric deposition can play a critical role in supplying new iron to the surface ocean (Fung et al. 2000). Most of the iron deposited onto the ocean surface comes from atmospheric mineral aerosols which is approximately 3.5 % iron, with small contributions from combustion sources (Luo et al. 2008); because of the dominance of mineral aerosols to the iron budget, the largest deposition of iron to the oceans occurs downwind of the large desert regions (Fig. 4.18a). Not all forms of iron are thought to be equally bioavailable (Jickells and Spokes 2001; Mahowald et al. 2009). Most soils have relatively insoluble iron forms, while atmospheric aerosols appear to be more soluble, arguing that atmospheric processing may be occurring (Jickells and Spokes 2001) and plausible mechanisms based on acidity have been proposed (e.g. Jickells and Spokes 2001; Meskhidze et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 1997), although this can be very sensitive to the mineralogical composition of aerosol (Journet et al. 2008). Smaller particles are slightly more soluble than larger particles (e.g. Baker and Jickells 2006; Chen and Siefert 2004; Hand et al. 2004), which can largely be explained by the longer residence time of smaller particles (Hand et al. 2004). Recent studies have suggested a role for combustion sources of soluble iron (Chuang et al. 2005; Guieu et al. 2005; Sedwick et al. 2007), however estimates from observations and models still suggest that the largest deposition of soluble iron occurs downwind of the main desert dust source areas (Fig. 4.18b). Extrapolations of the limited data on soluble iron from combustion and atmospheric processing suggest that soluble iron deposition may have doubled over the last century, assuming constant mineral aerosol composition because of increased pollution (Luo et al. 2008; Mahowald et al. 2009). More recent estimates of changes in desert dust over the past century based on observations suggest there may have been almost a doubling in desert dust between 1900 and 2000 (Mahowald et al. 2010), suggesting almost a quadrupling of soluble iron inputs to the oceans over this time period. The importance of atmospheric iron was probably initially overestimated (e.g. Ridgwell and Watson 2002), because of an underestimate of the ocean sediment sources of iron (Lam and Bishop 2008) and a lack of understanding of the role of colloids in the ocean in maintaining iron supply (Parekh et al."
36,555,0.924,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"13.1 Introduction The Old World bat family Pteropodidae is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of Australasia, Africa and Oceania (Marshall 1983; Mickleburgh et al. 1992). It comprises 196 species (Simmons 2005) that feed primarily on fruit, flowers (nectar, pollen, petals and bracts) and leaves of at least 188 plant genera from 64 families (Lobova et al. 2009; Fleming and Kress 2011), although some species have also been recorded eating insects (e.g. Clulow and Blundell 2011; Scanlon et al. 2013). Fujita (1988) and Fujita and Tuttle (1991) used the term √¢¬Ä¬òflying foxes√¢¬Ä¬ô to refer to all bats in the family Pteropodidae, but we restrict this term to the 70 species in the genera Pteropus and Acerodon (IUCN 2014), following the definition outlined by Kingston (2010), and use the term √¢¬Ä¬òfruit bats√¢¬Ä¬ô for the remainder. Although bat√¢¬Ä¬ìplant interactions were first recorded in 1772, it is now known that coevolution has shaped these complex interrelationships over millennia, producing bat-flower and bat-fruit syndromes (Marshall 1983; Fleming et al. 2009). This phytophagous diet results in valuable ecosystem services of pollination and seed dispersal (Kunz et al. 2011). Pteropodid bats are responsible for propagating at least 289 species of plants, of which 186 provide economically important resources and products including fruits, drinks, foods, ornamental plants, timbers, fibres, tannins, dyes, medicines, and animal fodder (Fujita and Tuttle 1991; Lobova et al. 2009). In addition, large populations of flying foxes are necessary to maintain the health of Old World tropical forests (Fujita and Tuttle 1991; Nyhagen et al. 2005; McConkey and Drake 2006). Such healthy functioning ecosystems ultimately provide humans with additional benefits such as climate regulation, nutrient cycling, water filtration, and erosion control (Kunz et al. 2011). P.A.

241,787,0.924,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Whether there is a reduction in sea-ice cover in the future depends mainly on the projected change in air temperature over the Baltic Sea in winter; other drivers such as wind are considered less important (e.g. Tinz 1996; Meier et al. 2004a, 2011d; Meier 2006; Jylh√É¬§ et al. 2008; Neumann 2010). Hence, the projected changes in sea-ice cover depend on the GHG emission scenario, the GCM and the Baltic Sea model used. Both dynamical modelling and statistical modelling suggest that the relationship between annual maximum ice extent and winter mean air temperature changes is nonlinear (Meier et al. 2004a; Jylh√É¬§ et al. 2008), that is, even under a warmer future climate, sea ice is likely in the northern Baltic Sea (Fig. 13.6)."
219,1084,0.924,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement √¢¬Ä¬ì A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Spatial Assessments of Land Degradation in Uzbekistan Despite the recognized severity of land degradation in Uzbekistan, there are few published studies on spatial assessment of this problem (Ji 2008). Kharin et al. (1999 cited in Ji 2008) created a land degradation map of 4 by 4 arc-minutes based on expert opinions and existing soil maps. It shows that land degradation is generally present throughout Uzbekistan, and that it is differentiated by land-use type and degradation cause. Based on these data, deserti√Ø¬¨¬Åcation is mainly characterized by vegetation cover degradation in rangelands and meadows. Given the fact that this map is partly based on expert opinion, objective and updated assessment is necessary. The spatial assessment of land degradation was also performed by Dubovyk et al. (2013b, c) for Khorezm, one of the most land degradation affected regions of Uzbekistan. The authors √Ø¬¨¬Ånd that land productivity decline, calculated from the 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for the monitoring period between 2000 and 2010, affects 23 % (94,835 ha) of the arable area in the study region. Le et al. (2014) have indicated a similar number of 26 % of croplands being degraded in Uzbekistan based on the trend analysis of 8 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data series for 1982√¢¬Ä¬ì2006. Moreover, Dubovyk et al. (2013a) conducted a spatial logistic regression modeling to determine main factors of distribution of degraded croplands in Khorezm region. The results of the statistical modeling suggest that the degradation processes were mainly determined by groundwater table and groundwater salinity, land use, slope, and irrigation water availability. There have been more studies on land use and cover changes (LUCC) in the region. For example, Chen et al. (2013) assessed changes in LUCC and ecosystem services in Central Asia during 1990√¢¬Ä¬ì2009. Klein et al. (2012) presented a classi√Ø¬¨¬Åcation approach for regional land-cover mapping of Central Asia. Spatial analyses on the aeolian geomorphic processes of the Central Asia were conducted by Maman et al. (2011). Kariyeva and Van Leeuwen (2011) studied environmental drivers of vegetation phenology in Central Asia based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from the AQUA/TERRA-MODIS NDVI and NOAA-AVHRR NDVI time series (1981√¢¬Ä¬ì2008). Spatial cropping patterns were observed in the Horazm region in Uzbekistan (Conrad et al. 2011, 2014).

These compounds represent the largest known natural contribution to atmospheric organic bromine and are recognised as an important source of reactive bromine to the troposphere and lower stratosphere, where they may contribute up to 40 % of O3 depletion in mid latitudes (Salawitch et al. 2005; Salawitch 2006; Yang et al. 2005; WMO 2011). The magnitude of the oceanic emissions is uncertain and ranges from 3 to 22 Gmol Br year 1, with a recurring mean of around 10 Gmol Br year 1 for CHBr3, and from 0.5 to 3.5 Gmol Br year 1 for CH2Br2 (Quack and Wallace 2003; WMO 2011). Elevated atmospheric concentrations have been observed over the tropical oceans (Class and Ballschmiter 1988a; Atlas et al. 1993; Schauffler et al. 1998) and were linked to oceanic supersaturations of the compounds and especially to productive upwelling areas. Equatorial surface waters of the tropical Atlantic were indeed identified as a significant CHBr3 source to the atmosphere, with CHBr3 production occurring in the deep chlorophyll maximum (Quack et al. 2004). Generally the oceanic distributions of the brominated compounds, bromoform, dibromomethane (CH2Br2), dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl) and bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2), are associated with the"

The repair of DSBs via nonhomologous end-joining is error-prone to some extent and therefore can lead to nucleotide deletions or insertions (indels) at the breakage site (Waterworth et al. 2011). Depending on the type of mutation, this can result in functional modification, complete disruption of gene function, or removal of whole gene clusters from the plant genome. For application of this technique in model and crop plant species, the following customizable endonuclease platforms with different benefits and drawbacks are available: meganucleases, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs); the latter derive from a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPRassociated (CRISPR/Cas) microbial defense system [reviewed in Fichtner et al. (2014)]. TALENs are created by the fusion of a customized TALE DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the FokI restriction-endonuclease domain (FokI-R) (Christian et al. 2010). Primarily, a TALE-DBD from plant pathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas sp. consists of a variable number of nearly identical amino acid repeats. Each repeat has a length of 33√¢¬Ä¬ì35 amino acids and binds preferentially to a certain nucleotide of the target DNA sequence (Boch et al. 2009; Moscou and Bogdanove 2009). Different binding specificity of distinct repeats can be explained by variations in amino acids 12 and 13, which are therefore called repeat variable diresidues (RVDs). The amino acid pairs most commonly used in RVDs of TALE-DBDs are NI (binding to adenine), NG (thymine), NN (guanine), and HD (cytosine). Given the opportunity of rearrangement of these repeats, it is possible to assemble a TALE-DBD for virtually any DNA target sequence of choice. Such customized TALEN-DBD in combination with the 25 kDa FokI-R domain, with the latter not having any own DNA-binding specificity (Li et al. 1992), TALENs represent a universal tool for DSB induction. However, FokI-R needs to form dimers to be catalytically active (Bitinaite et al. 1998). Therefore, two TALEN subunits binding to the desired target sequence in inverse orientation to each other are required. This obligatory dimerization decreases the probability for off-target mutations but also doubles the effort to produce an effective TALEN. TALENcoding DNA subunits can be highly efficiently assembled via Golden Gate cloning [e.g., Cermak et al. (2011)], PCR-based methods [e.g., Yang et al. (2013)], or FLASH assembly (Reyon et al. 2012). TALENs are more cost effective and much easier to handle than zinc-finger nucleases (Beumer et al. 2013). Therefore, TALENs were successfully applied for site-directed mutagenesis in a number of model and crop plants like Arabidopsis (Christian et al. 2013), tobacco (Zhang et al. 2013), Nicotiana benthamiana (Mahfouz et al. 2011), Brachypodium distachyon (Shan et al. 2013), rice (Li et al. 2012), Brassica oleracea (Sun et al. 2013), soybean (Haun et al. 2014), wheat (Wang et al. 2014), maize (Liang et al. 2014), and barley (Wendt et al. 2013; Gurushidze et al. 2014)."

In the Sargasso Sea, seasonal measurements of oceanic dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and DMSP (dimethylsulphoniopropionate) have provided one of the only long-term time series for DMS in the open ocean (e.g. Dacey et al. 1998; Toole et al. 2008). The observed decoupling of DMS concentration from its precursors (i.e. DMSP) in the Sargasso Sea is the basis for the √¢¬Ä¬òDMS summer paradox√¢¬Ä¬ô hypothesis (Simo√å¬Å and Pedro√å¬Ås-Alio√å¬Å 1999). The challenges that have faced ocean time-series programmes have been both practical and scientific. Sustaining ocean time-series requires the provision of suitable platforms for observation (i.e. research ships, moorings) and creates logistical demands if the continuity of funding and frequency of occupation are to be maintained. Scientific questions include reconciling time-variations within the context of the four dimensional state (space and time) of the ocean, which includes substantial mesoscale and sub-mesoscale variability (e.g. McGillicuddy et al. 1999, 2007). In the future, ocean time-series programmes will be integrated with the Global Ocean Observing System (http://www.ioc-goos.org/), with these sites acting as important nodes for new observing technologies such as gliders and AUV platforms (Dickey et al. 2009). Understanding ocean and climate relevant processes that influence the ocean√¢¬Ä¬ìatmosphere exchange of gases and particles requires an improved synergy between (sustained) observation and hypothesis testing over a variety of scales, both spatial and temporal."
241,981,0.924,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"streams, hydrological regimes during winter and spring have changed signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcantly (see also Chap. 5). This is mainly attributed to winters and springs becoming milder and in consequence late-winter and early-spring discharges increasing. Studies combining several hydrological model simulations (to the end of this century) in the Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme show that while results varied depending on the climate change scenario and model boundary conditions, some projections were consistent between runs, for example an overall increased autumn and winter run-off and increased annual run-off volume in northern Sweden (Andreasson et al. 2004). In a similar study focusing on river run-off for the entire Baltic Sea drainage basin, Graham (2004) found a general trend of reduced river flow from the south-eastern Baltic Sea catchment together with increased river flow from the north. The magnitude and timing of the spring flood is important for the annual fluxes of dissolved and particulate matter in boreal river systems (Woo et al. 2008). Higher spring temperatures and a higher proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain could result in earlier snowmelt and thinner snowpacks. This would lead to spring floods occurring earlier in the year and having a lower magnitude (Andreasson et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2008). However, in high-latitude catchments, sustained sub-zero winter temperatures coupled with increased precipitation may lead to maintained or even increased spring floods (Dankers and Middelkoop 2008). Rantakari et al. (2010) compared TOC fluxes in headwater streams between two climatically different years and found decreased TOC export during the spring ice melt period and increasing export during the rest of the year including snowcover and snow-free periods. Wet years have been shown to favour the export of TOC from forest-dominated areas (Kohler et al. 2009) and imply that future wetter conditions may increase the TOC export as well as many elements associated with TOC such as Al, Fe, trace elements and potentially harmful elements such as Hg. Empirical models of streamwater fluxes of DOC including both soil temperature and water fluxes have been able to predict seasonal variation in streamwater DOC concentrations reasonably accurately showing that both parameters are important (Kohler et al. 2009). Simulations of a climatic scenario with an average temperature increase of about 2.5 √Ç¬∞C and increase in precipitation of 25 % for a boreal headwater stream suggest an increase in the annual TOC export of approximately 15 % (Kohler et al. 2009). The model simulations also indicate that the autumn months are particularly sensitive and that wetter and warmer conditions could cause a TOC increase of up to 5 mg l√¢¬à¬í1 (Kohler et al. 2009). Temperature effects related to snow cover may also have profound effects on waterborne DOC export from forests (Agren et al. 2010). Higher temperature in organic soils has been shown to increase DOC export, not because of"

On the central and eastern coast, the maximum retreat of sand dunes was 1√¢¬Ä¬ì2 m year√¢¬à¬í1 (Zawadzka-Kahlau 1999). Today erosion after each storm surge reaches 3√¢¬Ä¬ì6 m; extreme erosion after storms in 2009 and 2012 reached 6 m year√¢¬à¬í1. Low coastal dunes were completely washed away and in some places need replacing by arti√Ø¬¨¬Åcial dikes or concrete walls. The situation is similar along more than twothirds of the Hel Peninsula, where beach nourishment, groynes and other measures protect the narrow land against flooding. Coastal dunes on the Wi√Ö¬õlana Sandspit along the Polish and Russian section were eroded in autumn and winter of 2006 and 2007 (Kobelyanskaya et al. 2009). Other studies show the Wi√Ö¬õlana and Curonian spits to be continuously eroded, with a recent increase near the Baltyjsk Strait (Volkova et al. 2004; Chubarenko et al. 2009). The heavy storm surge of 2012 caused dune retreat of up to 5 m on the Wi√Ö¬õlana Sandspit near the Polish√¢¬Ä¬ìRussian border, and substantial erosion in the eastern and middle parts of the Polish coast (√Ö¬Åabuz 2014). The exposed western Lithuanian coast is also strongly threatened by storm surges (Dailidiene et al. 2006). Erosion has totally consumed the foredunes along the Curonian Sandspit over past couple of decades. The German Baltic Sea sandy coast between Warnem√É¬ºnde and Darss Peninsula is eroding rapidly (Kortekaas et al. 2010). Near Warnem√É¬ºnde and on the west coast of Darss, erosion has reached 3 m since the mid-twentieth century (Kortekaas et al. 2010), probably due to heavy waves attacking the exposed west coast in winter. The November 1995 storm event caused material loss from the sandy shores of Usedom Island (Schwarzer et al. 2003). The situation was similar on the western and central Polish coast, where sea level reached 2 m amsl and coastal dunes retreated 5√¢¬Ä¬ì10 m (√Ö¬Åabuz 2005). Erosion along the dune shores in the Kattegat is up to 2 m year√¢¬à¬í1 (Clemmensen et al. 2011)."

An assessment of vulnerability specific to California was conducted for several reasons. First, because of the large volume of CPY used in that state (Fig. 1); second, the historical detections of CPY reported from monitoring studies conducted in the state (CDPR 2012a; CEPA 2011a, b; USGS 2013); third, the availability of detailed records on pesticide applications from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation√¢¬Ä¬ôs (CDPR) Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) database (CDPR 2012b); and fourth, because of the intensive use of furrow and flood irrigation on crops registered for use with CPY in the state (Orang et al. 2008). Losses in furrow and flood irrigation tail-water have been identified as a major cause of transport of pesticides, including CPY, to nontarget aquatic systems (Budd et al. 2009; Gill et al. 2008; Long et al. 2010; Starner et al. 2005). This pathway could not be simulated with the National Pesticide Assessment (NPAT) model. The assessment of vulnerability for California was conducted using the Cooccurrence of Pesticides and Species Tool (CoPST), a modeling framework developed by the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) to evaluate the potential spatial and temporal co-occurrence of pesticides with threatened or endangered aquatic and semi-aquatic species (Hoogeweg et al. 2011). The framework integrates a number of databases necessary for temporal and spatial analysis, including historical records of pesticide use and soil properties, weather records, agronomic data, and species habitat for the Sacramento River, San Joaquin, and the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary watersheds (SI Appendix C). Using the modeling framework, daily pesticide runoff and erosion losses in the Central Valley of CA were estimated for historical CPY applications to agricultural fields. Approximately 47,860 historical applications of CPY were simulated for the period 2000√¢¬Ä¬ì2008."

260,137,0.923,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ranaviruses can be transmitted by contact with infected individuals, through the water or on fomites (e.g., pond substrates), and by consuming part or all of infected animals (Langdon et al. 1988; Reddacliff and Whittington 1996; Jancovich et al. 1997; Plumb and Zilberg 1999b; Woodland et al. 2002b; Pearman et al. 2004; Harp and Petranka 2006; Brunner et al. 2007; Cunningham et al. 2007a; Robert et al. 2011; Brenes et al. 2014a). Viral mRNA is detectable in the intestines of larval and adult African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) as early as 3 h after exposure to virus in water and then spreads to other tissues, suggesting that the intestines are a primary point of entry of waterborne virus in amphibians (Robert et al. 2011). The skin may not be a common site of infection in metamorphosed amphibians because they secrete antimicrobial peptides on their skin, which can inactivate several types of pathogens, including FV3 and ATV (Chinchar et al. 2001, 2004; Sheafor et al. 2008; Rollins-Smith 2009). Brunner et al. (2007), however, demonstrated that a 1 s skinto-skin contact out of water was sufficient for transmission of ATV from infected, symptomatic tiger salamander larvae to uninfected larvae, so entry through the epithelium is possible at least during the larval stage."

Due to the minimum threshold surface wind speed required for aeolian erosion, and to the fact that the dust emission flux varies with the cube of the surface wind speed (Greeley and Iversen 1985), dust events are episodic and show a very high variability in strength. In terms of desert dust atmospheric concentrations or deposition at a given place, the intensity distribution at yearly or longer time scales generally shows a tail towards infrequent high values that control long-term means (Loye-Pilot and Martin 1996; Mahowald et al. 2009 and references therein on observations series). Desert dust transport is generally characterised by maximum concentrations of aerosol particles in turbid air layers lifted above the marine atmospheric boundary layer, as was observed in the North Pacific (Kritz et al. 1990), the tropical (Carlson and Prospero 1972; Karyampudi et al. 1999; Dulac et al. 2001) and"
230,41,0.923,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"(Scott 1972, p. 36). Gregory (1983) also assumed that this process led to √¢¬Ä¬úcomplete degradation of the plastic pellets and dispersal as dust√¢¬Ä¬ù (p. 82). However, it was a case of out of sight, out of mind. Thompson et al. (2004) showed that microscopic plastic fragments and fibres are ubiquitous marine pollutants. Together with the high media profile given the Pacific √¢¬Ä¬ògarbage patch√¢¬Ä¬ô (Moore et al. 2001) and similar litter aggregations in other mid-ocean gyres (e.g. Law et al. 2010; Eriksen et al. 2013a), the research by Thompson et al. (2004) was largely responsible for the recent resurgence in interest in the marine litter problem (Fig. 1.2). Like larger plastic items, √¢¬Ä¬òmicroplastics√¢¬Ä¬ô (Ryan and Moloney 1990) are now found throughout the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs oceans, including in deep-sea sediments (van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013). There is ongoing debate as to the size limit for √¢¬Ä¬òmicroplastics√¢¬Ä¬ô (Thompson 2015). Some authors take a broad view, including items <5 mm diameter (Arthur et al. 2009), whereas others restrict the term to items <2 mm, <1 mm or even <500 √Ç¬µm (Cole et al. 2011). Andrady (2011) argued the need for three terms: mesoplastics (500 √Ç¬µm√¢¬Ä¬ì5 mm), microplastics (50√¢¬Ä¬ì500 √Ç¬µm) and nanoplastics (<50 √Ç¬µm), each with their own set of physical characteristics and biological impacts. Depending on the upper size limit, industrial pellets may or may not be included in the term. But even if we adopt a narrow view, not all microplastics derive from degradation of larger plastic items. Some cosmetics, hand cleaners and air blast cleaning media contain small (<500 √Ç¬µm) plastic beads manufactured specifically for this purpose (Zitko and Hanlon 1991; Gregory 1996), the so-called primary microplastics (Cole et al. 2011). The proportion of primary microplastics in the environment probably is small compared to secondary microplastics, except for some areas of the Great Lakes in the United States (Eriksen et al. 2013b), but it is a largely avoidable source of pollution. Public pressure has already forced one major chemical company to commit to phasing out the use of plastic scrubbers in their products by 2015. Much of the concern around microplastics concerns their role in introducing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into marine foodwebs (Cole et al. 2011; Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Some of the additives used to modify the properties of plastics are biologically active, potentially affecting development and reproduction (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Meeker et al. 2009). Also, hydrophobic POPs in seawater are adsorbed onto plastic items (Carpenter et al. 1972; Mato et al. 2001; Teuten et al. 2009), and the smaller the particle, the more efficiently they accumulate toxins (Andrady 2011). Thompson et al. (2004) showed that invertebrates from three feeding guilds (detritivores, deposit feeders and filter feeders) all consumed microscopic plastic particles, reinforcing the results of early selectivity experiments demonstrating that filter feeders can consume small plastic particles (De Mott 1988; Bern 1990). Small particles also are eaten by myctophid fish (Boerger et al. 2010), which are an important trophic link in many oceanic ecosystems (Davison and Asch 2011). The subject of POP transfer is explored in more detail by Rochman (2015), but it is worth noting that strict controls on the use of several POPs (e.g. PCBs, HCHs, DDT and its derivatives) have decreased their concentrations on plastic pellets over the last few decades (Ryan et al. 2012). There remain concerns about the health impacts of other compounds whose use is not as strictly regulated"

Adult Atlantic swordfish tend to concentrate along boundary currents of the Gulf Stream and the Gulf of Mexico Loop Current (Table 9.23). They are subject to seasonal movement: one group moves northeastward along the U.S. continental shelf in summer and returns southwestward in autumn, and another group moves from deepwater westward toward the continental shelf in summer and back into deepwater in autumn (Palko et al. 1981; Arocha 1997; NMFS 2009b). Atlantic swordfish tend to move to warmer waters for spawning and cooler waters for feeding. They tend to migrate to the preferred temperatures or areas for spawning during the peak of a spawning season (Palko et al. 1981; Tserpes et al. 2008). Atlantic swordfish appear to spawn throughout the year, and spawning timing tends to vary among different spawning areas (Tables 9.21 and 9.22). Seasonal latitudinal migrations of swordfish, which may result from seasonal changes in sea surface temperature, are well documented (Nakamura 1985; Seki et al. 2002; Takahashi et al. 2003; Neilson et al. 2009). Although Atlantic swordfish have evolved a specialized muscle that functions like a brain heater and enables them to tolerate a wide range of temperatures and move rapidly between warm surface waters and cold waters at great depths (Carey 1990), their vertical distribution is generally limited by the depth of the thermocline (Block et al. 1992). Takahashi et al. (2003) also indicated that the vertical swimming behavior of swordfish changes in response to near-surface water temperatures. Limited information is available on the M of the Atlantic swordfish. In the assessment based on the results of the virtual population analysis (VPA) model, M was assumed to be 0.2 per year (Scott and Porch 2007). However, no information or evidence is presented to justify the choice of this value."

The traditional method is further divided into two levels, the domestic level and the small-scale processing plant level. The smallscale level of sago starch extraction uses electrical power on some processors. Santoso et al. (2015) found that the actual starch content in the pith is about 65% with fiber making up the remaining 35%. The mechanical process currently employed to extract sago starch is inefficient and often fails to dislodge residual starch embedded in the fibrous portion of the trunks (Karim et al. 2008). Several studies have found that sago starch can be extracted using commercial methods, only up to 55√¢¬Ä¬ì70% (dry weight basis) of the true sago starch content. The remaining starch is still trapped within the parenchyma cells or fibers in the sago pith waste (Mohd et al. 2001; Awg-Adeni et al. 2013; Lai et al. 2013). Sago pith waste still contains a lot of starch. According to Abd-Aziz (2002), the composition of sago pith waste on a dry weight basis contains 65.7% starch, 14.8% crude fiber, 1% crude protein, 4.1% ash, and 59.1% moisture. Linggang et al. (2012) reported that sago pith waste contains 58% starch, 23% cellulose, 9.2% hemicellulose, and 4% lignin on a dry basis. Awg-Adeni et al.

Several studies have been done on utilizing sago pith waste as a substrate for the production of enzymes and adsorbents (Singhal et al. 2008), glucose syrup (Asben et al. 2011; Linggang et al. 2012), fructose syrup (Mishima et al. 2011), bioethanol (Awg-Adeni et al. 2011; Peristiwati et al. 2011), and biobutanol (Linggang et al. 2011; Awg-Adeni et al. 2013)."

The bursts occurred in general during the impulsive and early post-impulsive phase of the parent flare, as commonly observed in SEP events. They were not found later on during long-duration -ray events. The presence of type II bursts shows that shock waves in the high corona are a common counterpart of -ray events.

Horn flies also promote livestock-avoidance behaviors, such as walking and tail switching (Harvey and Launchbaugh 1982). These additional activities and energy expenditures directly contribute to reduced livestock performance. Ticks (Amblyomma americanum Koch) reduce weight gains of British breeds, such as Hereford, by greater than 30 % (Byford et al. 1992). By contrast, ticks have less effect on Brahman crosses with British and Continental cattle, and little, if any, effect on Brahman cattle (Utech et al. 1978; George et al. 1985). Livestock gains in Australia could decrease by greater than 18 % because of increased tick infestations associated with climate change unless European and British cattle breeds are replaced by Brahmans or other tick-resistant breeds (White 2003). Climate change drivers also are anticipated to reduce livestock performance on many rangelands by reducing forage quantity, quality, or both (Polley et al. 2013). Drought obviously reduces forage production, whereas elevated CO2 has consistently been shown to increase plant C:N ratios and decrease tissue N concentrations (Cotrufo et al. 1998; Morgan et al. 2001), resulting in forage with reduced crude protein levels. Forage digestibility often declines at elevated CO2 (Morgan et al. 2004a; Milchunas et al. 2005). Regional-scale analyses indicate that livestock become more nutrient limited in warmer and drier climates as both dietary crude protein and digestible organic matter content of forages decrease (Craine et al. 2010). A 4-year study in the tallgrass prairie showed that warming reduced N concentration and, correspondingly, crude protein levels of live and dormant forage from five warm-season grasses (An et al. 2005). In the absence of protein supplementation, cattle production will decline if forage quality declines too greatly because forage intake is volume limited. Forage quality may increase in cooler regions, such as the northern USA and southern Canada (Craine et al. 2010), if winters become warmer and wetter as anticipated."

However, these estimators are based on the assumption of only exogenous covariates except for the time and spatial lag terms. Kukenova and Monteiro (2008) have suggested to use System-GMM estimator Blundell and Bond (1998) for dynamic spatial panel model with several endogenous variables. More specifically, they have investigated the finite sample properties of different estimators for spatial dynamic panel models (namely, spatial ML, spatial dynamic ML, least-square-dummy-variable, Diff-GMM and System-GMM) and concluded that, in order to account for the endogeneity of several covariates, spatial dynamic panel models should be estimated using System-GMM. The stationarity conditions on the spatial and temporal parameters in a dynamic spatial panel data model like (16) go beyond the standard condition |√è¬Ñ | < 1 in serial models, and the standard condition 1/√è¬âmin < √è¬Å < 1 in spatial models.

This uncertainty is greater than the projected DSL changes in the region. Freshwater fluxes arising from a negative GrIS mass balance have been shown to perturb the North Atlantic circulation and thus induce changes in SSH (Stammer 2008; Hu et al. 2009, 2011; Stammer et al. 2011). The model runs in the CMIP3 archive have not been forced with the additional freshwater flux coming as a consequence of decay of land-based ice masses. Hu et al. (2011) modelled the combined effect of forcing a model with both the SRES A1B scenario and a freshwater hosing from the GrIS. Using an unrealistically large hosing flux equivalent to 60 cm of global sea-level rise results in an additional global average steric contribution of about 2 cm by the end of the twenty√Ø¬¨¬Årst century and that the hosing has little detectable influence on DSL near Scandinavia and in the Baltic Sea.

(2011) claimed that run-off from the total Baltic Sea catchment would decrease if air temperature rises. Hansson et al. (2011) reconstructed river run-off to the Baltic Sea for the period 1500√¢¬Ä¬ì1995 using a statistical approach with air temperature and atmospheric circulation indices as predictors. They found that over the past 500 years, the total river run-off to the Baltic Sea showed no signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant long-term trend but decreased slightly in response to the observed rise in temperature, at a rate of 3 % per 1 √Ç¬∞C rise (see also Chap. 5, Fig. 5.3). However, their approach considerably underestimates interannual variability. In addition, changes in future climate that by the end of the century are projected to be outside the range of decadal variability are very likely not comparable with changes in past climate because past anthropogenic warming is small and other drivers may have controlled the air temperature√¢¬Ä¬ì run-off relationship. Studies of both past and future climates suggest that increased total run-off would increase the ventilation of the upper halocline due to weakened strati√Ø¬¨¬Åcation causing improved oxygen conditions in the upper deep-water (e.g. Gustafsson and Omstedt 2009; Meier et al. 2011b).

391,760,0.922,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"4.5.4.2 Experimental: Microcosms Microcosm experiments involve the enclosure of a water sample in a container, typically 1√¢¬Ä¬ì10 l in volume, and its incubation under simulated in situ conditions. Microcosm experiments are often used in the study of the effects of atmospheric nutrient deposition on natural plankton communities, as they represent an easy experimental approach to monitor a wide range of chemical and biological properties and their response to controlled perturbations. Microcosm experiments have the same limitations as any approach that involves in vitro confinement of water samples, including sampling bias and the difficulty of precisely simulating in situ conditions. The composition of the community can change markedly after bottle enclosure (Massana et al. 2001; Calvo-D√Ñ¬±√å¬Åaz et al. 2011) and therefore most bioassay experiments have a duration that does not exceed 3√¢¬Ä¬ì4 days (e.g. Bonnet et al. 2005; Mills et al. 2004; Moore et al. 2008), which means the recorded changes represent short-term responses to the simulated perturbation. For all these reasons, the results obtained from bioassay experiments are best interpreted in conjunction with in situ observations collected during oceanographic cruises and time-series monitoring programmes. Published reports show a large degree of variability in the responses of surface plankton communities during microcosm fertilisation experiments intended to simulate the effects of atmospheric deposition. Part of this variability stems from the fact that the materials used to amend the water samples differ widely among studies, as they may consist of collected aerosols (Herut et al. 2005), collected rainwater (Klein et al. 1997), unprocessed desert soils (Mills et al. 2004), and atmospherically processed soils (Ternon et al. 2011).

One of its key advantages is that it enables extrapolation not just in space, but also temporally, offering insight into change of vegetation pattern and development through time. Rapid developments in remote-sensing-based hydrological monitoring are providing unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage in estimates of hydrological variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, ET (Kustas et al. 1994; Garcia et al. 2008), surface water level (Alsdorf et al. 2000), and groundwater storage (Yeh et al. 2006). In rangelands, the irregular spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall imposes key constraints on ecosystem function and development. Remote measurement of precipitation has an extensive history, with numerous hydrological investigations being informed by the two-decade-long Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite system (Kummerow et al. 2000) and related sensors. Over the coming years, the next generation of satellite rainfall-measuring systems, referred to as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, will provide a muchneeded update to the space-based rainfall monitoring capacity.

So although only two of the four reptilian orders are found in New Zealand, the diversity does span an unparalleled phylogenetic scale for this group of vertebrates. Furthermore, New Zealand species diversity is high but only in some parts of the tree (Fig. 3b).

Other studies extended the biogeographic range of cold-seep communities onto the abyssal plain and into the southern reaches of the Gulf of Mexico (MacDonald et al. 2004). Surveys and process studies have established that the critical connection between geological and biogeochemical processes that make cold-seep communities viable is the presence of a wide range of microbes (Fisher et al. 2007). Cold-seep communities in the Gulf of Mexico are unique in that the methane that fuels these bacteria is predominantly thermogenic in origin, whereas at other worldwide sites, microbiologic methane is generally more important. Symbionts, microbial mats, and free-living bacteria are ubiquitous, serving as the primary producers of cold-seep food webs (MacAvoy et al. 2005; Fisher et al. 2007). Consortia of bacteria are capable of critical metabolic conversions such as oxidizing methane and reducing sulfate ions, thereby supporting macrofauna communities and producing critical hard substrate via carbonate precipitation (see Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.4)."
376,890,0.921,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Three general modes of applying remote sensing have emerged in rangeland monitoring. The first mode is to use remote-sensing technologies and products to replace field measurements. Numerous studies have shown that interpretation or classification of high-resolution imagery can match or outperform many field-based measurements of certain attributes (e.g., Booth et al. 2005; Seefeldt and Booth 2006; Cagney et al. 2011; Hulet et al. 2014b). Land cover classifications or predictions of vegetation attributes (e.g., cover) have been used for landscape-scale rangeland assessment and monitoring (e.g., Hunt and Miyake 2006; Marsett et al. 2006; Homer et al. 2013). Regression models (e.g., Homer et al. 2012) or geostatisical techniques (e.g., Karl 2010) are used to predict rangeland indicators over landscapes from a set of field samples. In these cases, it is more important that the field sample locations represent the range and extremes of the indicators being predicted than to be randomly selected (Gregoire 1998). Historic analysis of rangeland condition is also possible using archives of aerial photography (e.g., Tappan et al. 2004; Rango et al. 2005) or satellite imagery (e.g., Washington-Allen et al. 2006; Malmstrom et al. 2008).

280,522,0.921,Diversity and Evolution of Butterfly Wing Patterns : An integrative Approach,"Dragonflies display a wide variety of coloration such as red, yellow, blue, and green. Most of animal colors are derived from structural colors and/or pigment colors. The mechanisms of structural coloration of several dragonfly species have been recently investigated, wherein multilayer structures are generally involved in iridescent coloration (Vukusic et al. 2004; Hariyama et al. 2005; Schultz and Fincke 2009; Stavenga et al. 2012; Nixon et al. 2013, 2015; Guillermo-Ferreira et al. 2015). Non-iridescent blue color is also structural, attributed to coherent light scattering from the quasi-ordered nanostructures within pigment cells (Prum et al. 2004). By contrast, information on pigments in dragonflies is still limited. We analyzed the red epidermal pigments from three species of red dragonfly, namely, the autumn darter Sympetrum frequens, the summer darter Sympetrum darwinianum, and the scarlet skimmer Crocothemis servilia (Futahashi et al. 2012). Two ommochrome pigments, xanthommatin (vivid red color in reduced form) and decarboxylated xanthommatin (dull red color in reduced form) were consistently identified in all these species (Fig. 17.7a), in which the ratio of xanthommatin is higher in vivid red color species. Previous studies have shown that the color of ommochrome pigments changes reversibly by redox reactions in vitro (Linzen 1974). By injecting a reductant (vitamin C) solution, we confirmed that the yellowish body color of both immature males and mature females changed into red as observed in mature males (Fig. 17.7b). Redox conditions of the extracted ommochrome pigments were measured electrochemically, and the relative abundance of the oxidized and reduced forms of pigments were evaluated. In all three species, only the mature males exhibited very high proportions of the reduced ommochrome pigments (Fig. 17.7c), indicating that sex-specific color change in mature red dragonflies is primarily attributed to redox states of the ommochrome pigments (Futahashi et al. 2012). Pigment-based color changes in animals are mainly attributed to the following three mechanisms: synthesis and degradation of pigments, changes in localization of pigments, and accumulation of pigments from food (Stevens and Merilaita 2011). Red dragonflies adopt a previously unknown mechanism, namely, a body color change by redox reaction of the pigments. Male-specific color change of dragonflies has been considered as an ecologically important trait for reproductive success. Considering that mature males exhibit territorial behavior under the scorching sun and the reduced pigments show antioxidant abilities (Futahashi et al. 2012), male-specific red pigments may have additional role in preventing oxidative stress from UV radiation."
241,163,0.921,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"temperature in north-western Russia increased from 4 to 10√¢¬Ä¬ì 12 √Ç¬∞C (Wohlfarth et al. 2007). In the very √Ø¬¨¬Årst warm phase of the Preboreal around 11,530√¢¬Ä¬ì11,500 cal year BP, the arboreal vegetation began spreading rapidly in ice-free regions as a result of an abrupt warming (within 50 years or less) and tundra√¢¬Ä¬ìsteppe vegetation dominated by shrubs and grass typical of the Younger Dryas was replaced by open forest associations (Bos et al. 2007). In the earliest warm phase of the Preboreal period, birch and pine started to spread, the former more vigorously than the latter. Periglacial vegetation still occupied large areas in some parts of the Baltic Sea basin. During the initial phase of this warming, the broadleaved trees appeared in ice-free regions, where Tilia, Ulmus, Corylus and Fraxinus pollen was √Ø¬¨¬Årst found. A shift from clastic√¢¬Ä¬ìdetrital deposition to an autochthonous sedimentation dominated by biochemical calcite precipitation was identi√Ø¬¨¬Åed in the Early Holocene by accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) 14C dating *11,600 cal year BP of Lake Ha√Ö¬Ñcza (north-eastern Poland) sediments (Lauterbach et al. 2011). The accumulation of silt and clay was replaced by organic-rich gyttja at 11,650 cal year BP also in eastern Latvia (Veski et al. 2012). Within the territory of the present Lithuania, a gradual amelioration of environmental conditions started at about 11,500 cal BP. However, there (Stan√Ñ¬çikait√Ñ¬ó et al. 2004, 2008) and in north-western Russia (Wohlfarth et al. 2007) the change was less pronounced than that recorded in the North Atlantic region (Bj√É¬∂rck et al. 1996). The early expansion of Picea within the local vegetation, even before 11,500 cal BP, is worth noting. Despite a prolonged discussion involving pollen data, macrofossil √Ø¬¨¬Ånds and modern genetic information, the Lateglacial and Early Holocene history of Picea in this part of Europe is still under debate (Giesecke and Bennett 2004; Lata√Ö¬Çowa and van der Knaap 2006). Identi√Ø¬¨¬Åcation of Picea pollen and macrofossil √Ø¬¨¬Ånds suggests the local presence of this tree species during the earliest stages of the Holocene in the north-eastern and northern Lithuania (Kabailien√Ñ¬ó 1993; Kabailien√Ñ¬ó et al. 2009; Stan√Ñ¬çikait√Ñ¬ó et al. 2009; Gaidamavi√Ñ¬çius et al. 2011). Recent evidence of stomata, needles and wood suggests that spruce populations expanded into Latvia during the Younger Dryas (Koff and Terasmaa 2011; Veski et al. 2012). Moreover, the presence of Picea abies suggests a relatively warm climate in this region, with warm summers (*10√¢¬Ä¬ì13 √Ç¬∞C) and moist soil conditions (Giesecke and Bennett 2004) shortly before 11,500 cal year BP. However, changes in the vegetation composition point to the presence of at least two short cold climate episodes between 11,500 and 11,100 cal year BP in north-eastern Lithuania (Stan√Ñ¬çikait√Ñ¬ó et al. 2009).

In Fig. 15.2, we show the two-dimensional distributions of turbidity, temperature, and dissolved Mn anomalies observed by tow-yo survey line S15ty around the Kairei field. The results from the other tow-yo survey lines are also shown in Suppl. 15.2√¢¬Ä¬ì15.7 (supplementary data). The hydrothermal plume was determined based on the higher turbidity (√é¬îFTU) in the plume than in the ambient nonplume seawater (Suppl. 15.8). The hydrothermal plume around Kairei field arose from the seafloor up to approximately 2,150-m water depth below the sea surface and the thickness of the non-buoyant plume was approximately 120 m (Fig. 15.2). Gamo et al. (1996, 2001) and Zhu et al. (2008) detected the hydrothermal plume based on the turbidity anomalies around Kairei field in September 1993 (Gamo et al. 1996), in August 2000 (Gamo et al. 2001), and in December 2005 (Zhu et al. 2008), respectively. The previous studies also reported the upper limit depth of hydrothermal plume at 2,150 m below sea surface (Gamo et al. 1996, 2001; Zhu et al. 2008). The variation of seawater density is caused by the temperature and salinity. Considering that the maximum height of hydrothermal plume is regulated by the density of the end-member hydrothermal fluid and vertical distribution of the density in the ambient seawater, the hydrothermal fluid chemistry and discharging pattern of the Kairei field would have been stable for at least 17 years. The horizontal distribution of the hydrothermal plume based on the turbidity anomalies showed the Kairei hydrothermal plume was spread to north or northwest direction from the vents in Kairei field (Suppl. 15.2√¢¬Ä¬ì15.7). Figure 15.3 demonstrated the horizontal distribution of CH4, H2, and microbial cell density in the hydrothermal plume (from 2,144 to 3,341 m of water depth) using the water sample collected by the CTD-CMS. The maximum concentration of H2 in the hydrothermal plume was 87.6 nM observed near the Kairei field (Table 15.1).

Part of the motivation behind ECD was the need to more deeply understand the constructs to be measured and to use that understanding for assessment design. In keeping with that motivation, the beginning of this period saw the release of key publications detailing construct theory for achievement domains, which feed into the domain analysis and modeling aspects of ECD. Those publications concentrated on elaborating the construct of communicative competence for the TOEFL computer-based test (CBT), comprising listening, speaking, writing, and reading (Bejar et al. 2000; Butler et al. 2000; Cumming et al. 2000; Enright et al. 2000). Toward the end of the period, the Cognitively Based Assessment of, for, and as Learning (CBAL√Ç¬Æ) initiative (Bennett and Gitomer 2009) was launched.

At the same time, the communication of predictive validity results for postsecondary admissions tests was improved. Building upon earlier work, Bridgeman and colleagues showed how the percentage of students who achieved a given grade point average increased as a function of score level, a more easily understood depiction than the traditional validity coefficient (Bridgeman et al. 2008). Also advanced was the research stream on test anxiety, one of several potential sources of irrelevant variance (Powers 2001). Notable too was the increased attention given students from special populations. For students with disabilities, two research lines dominated, one related to testing and validation concerns that included but went beyond the postsecondary admissions focus of the 1980s and 1990s (Ekstrom and Smith 2002; Laitusis et al. 2002), and the second on accessibility (Hansen et al. 2004; Hansen and Mislevy 2006; Hansen et al. 2005). For English learners, topics covered accessibility (Hansen and Mislevy 2006; Wolf and Leon 2009), accommodations (Young and King 2008), validity frameworks and assessment guidelines (Pitoniak et al. 2009; Young 2009), and instrument and item functioning (Martiniello 2009; Young et al. 2008)."

376,405,0.92,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","By contrast, there is no consistent relationship between biomass response to experimental warming and mean annual precipitation (MAP) across terrestrial plants studied (Fig. 7.6; Lin et al. 2010). Experimental warming has been shown to reduce soil water content by increasing evapotranspiration (Harte and Shaw 1995; Wan et al. 2005), with potentially negative effects on ANPP. Warming also may enhance productivity by alleviating low temperature limits on plant growth (Luo 2007; Lin et al. 2010) and increasing N mineralization (Rustad et al. 2001; Dijkstra et al. 2008). These opposing influences of warming may explain why many rangeland experiments have shown little consistent warming effect (Polley et al. 2013) and why interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation are smaller than expected from single-factor effects (Fig. 7.2b; Wu et al. 2011; Morgan et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2013). Corollary 4 Precipitation seasonality regulates ecosystem responses to both CO2 and warming. Warming and CO2 enrichment combined should lead to earlier and more rapid plant growth in ecosystems dominated by winter precipitation because warming will reduce temperature limitations on both growth and growth responses to CO2. On the other hand, warming may reduce CO2 benefits on arid and semiarid rangelands dominated by summer precipitation by increasing evaporative demand. The evaporative potential of air increases nonlinearly with temperature, such that a given increase in temperature will cause a disproportionately large increase in evaporative demand when temperature is high. Plant responses to CO2 enrichment alone also depend on the seasonal distribution of precipitation. CO2 stimulated ANPP of Australian grassland most during years when summer rainfall exceeded rainfall during spring and autumn (Hovenden et al. 2014). High rainfall during cool spring and autumn seasons may reduce production in this grassland by intensifying N limitation to plant growth."

Modeling approaches are useful for interpreting experimental and observation data, as well as for risk assessment of the hazards caused by plastic ingestion in wildlife (Koelmans 2015). Because this is discussed in detail by Koelmans (2015), the discussion here will be limited to observational data in the field and experimental data in the laboratory. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that chemical contaminants do transfer from plastic debris to marine animals. Correlative evidence in the field and laboratory shows that the concentrations of PCBs (Ryan et al. 1988; Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011) and trace metals (Lavers et al. 2014) in seabirds are positively correlated with the mass of ingested plastic. Moreover, seabirds collected from the North Pacific were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the ingested plastic in their gut content (Tanaka et al. 2013) and myctophid fish collected from the South Atlantic were found with similar congener patterns of PBDEs in their tissues as those found on the plastic debris in the region (Rochman et al. 2014b). These observational data suggest that plastic-associated chemicals from plastic do transfer to wildlife upon ingestion. This hypothesis has been further investigated in controlled laboratory studies, providing a stronger weight of evidence. Two studies demonstrated the bioaccumulation of additive PBDEs in crickets (Acheta domesticus; Gaylor et al. 2012) and amphipods (Allorchestes compressa; Chua et al. 2014) as a result of the ingestion of plastic. Another study showed greater concentrations of PCBs in lugworms exposed to contaminated sediment with polystyrene as opposed to contaminated sediment without plastic, suggesting that the existence of the plastic in the experiment facilitated the transfer of chemicals to lugworms (Arenicola marina; Besseling et al. 2013). Another laboratory study demonstrated that both additive chemicals and chemicals that accumulate in nature (nonylphenol, phenanthrene, PBDE-47 and triclosan) desorb from PVC and can transfer into the tissues of lugworms upon ingestion (A. marina; Browne et al. 2013). Lastly, a study measuring the bioaccumulation of POPs sorbed to plastics demonstrated the transfer of chrysene, PCB 28 and several congeners of PBDEs to fish from the ingestion of polyethylene pellets (Rochman et al. 2013b). Thus, there is strong evidence showing that chemical contaminants can bioaccumulate in marine life when plastic debris is ingested. What remains less understood, is whether these plastic-associated contaminants biomagnify in higher trophic level animals as a direct result of plastic ingestion (potentially leading to bioaccumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in seafood; Fig. 5.3) and how important bioaccumulation from plastic is relative to bioaccumulation from other sources of chemical contamination in the environment (e.g. chemical contamination that is ubiquitous in water, sediments and food webs globally; Ross and Birnbaum 2010). Still, the fact that chemicals from plastic debris can transfer to marine animals begs the question, how do these chemicals associated with plastic debris impact marine organisms?"
73,903,0.92,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Intertidal coastal wetlands are dynamic systems that are habitat for mangrove and saltmarsh plant communities. They deliver a wide range of ecosystem services (Perillo et al. 2009) providing a range of value and non-value uses (see Barbier et al. 2010 for a detailed review) including nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important √Ø¬¨¬Åsh species (Sheaves et al. 2014), habitat for migratory birds (Visser and Baltz 2009) and aesthetic green spaces. Coastal wetlands improve water quality by stripping nutrients and intercepting sediments, and they reduce erosion by protecting the foreshore from waves and currents (Costanza et al. 2006). In addition, mangrove and saltmarsh are amongst the most ef√Ø¬¨¬Åcient ecosystems in the world at sequestering carbon (Saintilan et al. 2013) and are being investigated for future Blue Carbon opportunities (e.g., Mcleod et al. 2011; Irving et al. 2011). However loss of coastal wetlands is a major concern globally (Irving et al. 2011) with urbanisation and development identi√Ø¬¨¬Åed as the most common cause of mangrove loss (Dale et al. 2014). Losses in New South Wales (NSW) Australia have been estimated at 60 % for the period from European settlement (1788) to 1970 (Goodrick 1970) with losses continuing to occur (Pressey and Middleton 1982). More recently loss of saltmarsh (Saintilan et al. 2014) has resulted in its listing as an endangered ecological community within NSW and nationally. The high conservation value of coastal wetlands is now better recognised with many protected by legislation and sometimes via land use zonings. However, even when there is protection via zoning or other means, coastal wetlands often retain legacies of past land uses that pre-date the zoning. Clearing, draining and construction of roads associated with agricultural and urban development are major contributors to loss, fragmentation and degradation of coastal wetlands (Williams and Watford 1997).

260,329,0.92,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Electron Microscopy Electron microscopy (EM) is used for visual confirmation of the identity of cultured virus and for visualizing the virus within tissue sections. Verification of the cultured product involves negative staining and assessment via scanning EM (SEM); whereas, preserved tissues are used to visualize the virus within the tissues by transmission EM (TEM). For example, Burton et al. (2008) used TEM to examine the ultrastructure of tissues from a malformed eye of a preserved specimen. Electron microscopy revealed that the sample contained viral particles consistent with the family Iridoviridae, which allowed further characterization of ranavirus using PCR and DNA sequencing. Similarly, histological examination may reveal structures suggestive of intracellular viral inclusions, and EM can be used to verify the particles are viral origin (Cunningham et al. 1996, 2007; Balseiro et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2014; Meng et al. 2014). In general, identification is only reliably made at the family (Iridoviridae) level; however, Hyatt et al. (2000, 2002) reported variations in size among members of the family, suggesting that more specific identification might be possible. As early as the 1980s, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been used to examine the ultrastructure of the surface of viruses (see Adrian et al. 1984). This technique uses rapid freezing of purified virus, thus avoiding alterations from chemical preservatives. During the procedure, multiple photos are taken and reconstructed to yield a 3D image of the virus. Researchers have been using cryo-EM to evaluate the role of various surface proteins in viral assembly and replication (see Yan et al. 2009; Whitley et al. 2010; Tran et al. 2011). It is possible that these findings may provide insight into treatment protocols or vaccine development."
142,323,0.92,Subseafloor Biosphere Linked To Hydrothermal Systems : Taiga Concept,"Seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits occur at and around the plate boundaries, e.g., mid-ocean ridges, backarc basins and volcanic arcs (Hannington et al. 2011). These SMS deposits consist of relatively insoluble sulfide minerals, e.g., pyrite (FeS2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), sphalerite (ZnS), and galena (PbS), and also contain trace elements such as Au, Ag, Co and in some cases, Ni (Herzig and Hannington 1995). The hydrothermally active and inactive vents of chimney- and mound-shaped SMS deposits are microbe-rich environments, with microbial densities of up to 1010 cells (g sulfide) 1 (Kato et al. 2010; Schrenk et al. 2003; Suzuki et al. 2004; Takai and Horikoshi 1999), which are densities comparable with those in soils and animal bowels (Whitman et al. 1998). Dissolved H2, H2S, CH4 and Fe2+ supplied from hydrothermal fluids in the active sulfide vents serve as energy sources for the microbial communities. Conversely, microbial communities in inactive sulfide vents apparently use metal sulfides as energy sources (Edwards et al. 2003a). An in situ examination of SMS ores with time suggested that sulfide minerals on the seafloor are highly weathered by microbes (Edwards et al. 2003b). However, a quantitative assessment of the elements released from or adsorbed by SMS deposits mediated by microbes had not been done prior to this report. Considering the high levels of heavy metals in the SMS deposits and the ubiquity of these deposits on the seafloor (Hannington et al. 2011; Herzig and Hannington 1995), an experimental study of the change with time of the SMS components via microbial activity is important to understand how such events impact the oceanic biogeochemical cycles. The concentrations of certain heavy metals, e.g., Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu and Ni, which are essential for oceanic microbial viability, are extremely small (<0.1 √é¬ºM) in the ocean (Morel and Price 2003; Sohrin and Bruland 2011). The exchange of these heavy metals between seawater and SMS deposits is potentially needed for the maintenance of important oceanic microbial ecosystems. Here, we report the effects of microbes on the exchanges of elements between SMS samples and seawater by simulating the environmental conditions of deep seafloor (i.e., low temperature, weakly alkaline pH and a small amount of organic carbon). The goals of this study were (i) to measure the kinetics of the dissolution of certain metals and P from a recovered SMS sample and (ii) to assess if and how microbial communities affect the kinetics."

391,553,0.919,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"Goddard et al. (2000) found a general decrease in dissolved CH4 with increasing river discharge. Their compilation of published CH4 saturations in rivers worldwide revealed a typical range of ~1,000√¢¬Ä¬ì40,000 %, with one extreme value for an organic-rich Amazon tributary exceeding 400,000 % (Upstill-Goddard et al. 2000). Data from 474 freshwater ecosystems point to a major CH4 source in inland waters (Bastviken et al. 2011). Part of this contribution is almost certainly included in the source estimate for global wetlands (Table 3.3). The CH4 source from inland waters should perhaps be formally specified as an important component in the global tropospheric CH4 budget. Most estuarine CH4 data are for temperate systems. Methane saturations of up to 8,000 % have been reported for some shallow coastal embayments (Ferro√å¬Ån et al. 2007; Kitidis et al. 2007). A CH4 saturation of up to 20,000 % may be typical of the mid- to upper-inner estuary (Upstill-Goddard et al. 2000; Abril and Iversen 2002; Middelburg et al. 2002). As much as 158,000 % CH4 saturation has been reported in the Sado estuary, Portugal (Middelburg et al. 2002). The highest value recorded exceeds 3,000,000 % for the small, polluted subtropical Aydar estuary in SE India (Nirmal Rajkumar et al. 2008). This may be considered exceptional, resulting from a high organic carbon input in fresh domestic organic wastes and intense sediment methanogenesis. Indeed, methanogenesis rates were estimated to be close to maximal for the ambient temperature (Nirmal Rajkumar et al. 2008). An important aspect of CH4 cycling in many wellmixed macrotidal estuaries is strong tidal asymmetry with the velocity of the flood tide exceeding that of the ebb tide. This gives rise to the net transport of suspended particles upstream and retains river borne particles in a well defined turbidity maximum zone at low salinity (Uncles and Stephens 1993). High microorganism numbers associated with the suspended particles (Plummer et al. 1987) and long particle lifetimes promote enhanced biogeochemical cycling in such regions and CH4 concentrations can significantly exceed those in the input rivers (Fig. 3.15) (Upstill-Goddard et al. 2000). While this could result from active CH4 release from the underlying sediments during particle resuspension (as discussed above), it could also reflect in situ water column production of CH4 through attachment of methanogenic"

Efferent-mediated cochlear gain reduction was greatest for precursors with frequencies the same as, or close to that of, the signal (gain was reduced by about 20 dB), and least for precursors with frequencies well removed from that of the signal (gain remained at around 40 dB). The tuning of the efferent effect filter (tuning extending 0.5√¢¬Ä¬ì0.7 octaves above and below the signal frequency) is within the range obtained in humans using otoacoustic emissions (Lilaonitkul and Guinan, J Assoc Res Otolaryngol 10:459√¢¬Ä¬ì470, 2009; Zhao and Dhar, J Neurophysiol 108:25√¢¬Ä¬ì30, 2012).

376,216,0.919,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Soils have a large influence on shifts in vegetation composition that are common in rangelands (Bestelmeyer et al. 2003), particularly since rangeland vegetation is extremely sensitive to soil degradation (van de Koppel et al. 2002). Vegetation composition not only responds to soils, but can also cause large changes in soil properties and functions (Diaz et al. 2002; Eviner and Chapin 2003; Bestelmeyer and Briske 2012). The magnitude and direction of soil changes, and which attributes are modified, depend on the magnitude of species composition change, as well as ecological site conditions. The most common vegetation shifts that occur in rangelands include shifts from palatable to unpalatable vegetation; shifts from herbaceous to woody dominance; changes in grass species composition; shifts from grass to forb dominance (Vetter 2005). Each of these categories are summarized below. Shifts from palatable to unpalatable vegetation. Preferential grazing can decrease the prevalence of palatable plants and increase unpalatable plants (Bestelmeyer et al. 2003; Seymour et al. 2010). This shift tends to occur under continuous grazing regimes, particularly under lower soil nutrient availability (Wardle 2002; Harrison and Bardgett 2008), and more arid conditions (Diaz et al. 2007). Unpalatable plants represent a variety of growth forms, including other grasses, forbs, or woody species. These plants usually have lower nutrient concentrations and higher chemical defenses than palatable species, so their litter inputs decrease rates of nutrient recycling, further decreasing plant nutrient availability (Bardgett and Wardle 2003; Harrison and Bardgett 2008). Such changes in soils can lead to delayed or inhibited recovery of palatable vegetation, even after grazing has ceased (Bestelmeyer et al. 2003; Seymour et al. 2010). Shifts from herbaceous to woody dominance. Many rangelands across the globe have experienced increasing woody encroachment over the past century (Fig. 4.1), which has been attributed to a variety of factors, including: overgrazing, decreased human disturbance, lower fire frequency, nitrogen (N) deposition, climate change, and predator suppression (Eldridge et al. 2011; Chapter 2, this volume). The encroachment of shrubs and trees into herbaceous-dominated rangeland has extremely variable impacts on multiple soil properties depending upon the plant species, local climate, and soil type (Schuman et al. 2002; Barger et al. 2011). Generally, woody plant encroachment leads to more patchy vegetation cover causing higher heterogeneity in soil conditions (Van Auken 2009; Barger et al. 2011) and lower water infiltration and increased vulnerability to erosion, particularly after fires and during droughts, in plant interspaces (Ravi et al. 2009; Barger et al. 2011). This is why in some areas, shrub encroachment has been linked with significant soil degradation and even desertification (Bestelmeyer et al. 2003; Ravi et al. 2009), but this is not true everywhere (Eldridge et al. 2011). In general, woody encroachment increases surface soil C, total N, mineralizable N, soil aggregate stability, and available"

391,544,0.919,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"Although CH4 concentrations in the open ocean are generally rather low (a few nM), net mixed layer CH4 production means that O2-saturated near-surface waters are generally also supersaturated in CH4, with typical values of 130√¢¬Ä¬ì160 % and maxima near the base of the mixed layer (Oudot et al. 2002; Forster et al. 2009). Considerably higher mixed layer CH4 supersaturation is, however, not uncommon. Figure 3.14 illustrates this for the upper 300 m of the water column on north√¢¬Ä¬ìsouth Atlantic Ocean transects. In addition to upper ocean CH4 production, lateral supply from continental margins (Sect. 3.4.4) has also been invoked to explain high mixed layer CH4 concentrations (Reeburgh 2007). Similar to N2O, elevated CH4 levels are also found in intermediate waters (~500√¢¬Ä¬ì1,000 m depth) of the three major open ocean OMZs: the Eastern Tropical North and South Pacific and the Arabian Sea (Naqvi et al. 2010), and in the upwelling zones associated with these OMZs (Sect. 3.3.5). In these regions seasonal upwelling of nutrient-rich waters fuels primary productivity and enhances the downward flux of biogenic particles (Rixen et al. 1996), leading to O2 consumption in the intermediate waters and subsequent methanogenesis. Below the ocean mixed layer and away from the OMZ√¢¬Ä¬ôs, CH4 concentrations progressively decrease through oxidation, such that CH4 concentrations may approach undetectable levels in the deep ocean basins (Upstill-Goddard et al. 1999; Yoshida et al. 2011). Occasionally this deep water CH4 signal impacts surface waters through oceanic upwelling, as is illustrated by the bottom panel of Fig. 3.14 where the effect of equatorial upwelling is evident as far north as ~15 N. Overall, on an annual basis the open ocean CH4 budget is considered to be in steady-state with in situ production and vertical transport balancing CH4 oxidation and emissions to the troposphere."

Ecosystems based on metabolism of inorganic materials are of interest for their potential insight into the origins of life (e.g., Alt 1988; Juniper and Fouquet 1988; Duhig et al. 1992; Juniper and Tebo 1995; Hofmann and Farmer 2000; Reysenbach and Cady 2001). In the context of the TAIGA project, hydrothermal activity in the Southern Mariana Trough is recognized as Sulfur TAIGA and Iron TAIGA (Urabe et al. Chap. 1), and the project aims to elucidate what kind of ecosystems are prevalent, what kind of metabolisms they employ, and what kind of chemical environments they live in (Urabe et al. 2009). In this tectonic setting, in which hydrothermal activities are extending southward, how ecosystems propagate may shed light on more general questions about the evolution of life processes. Also, a fundamental question about mass flux at Earth√¢¬Ä¬ôs surface is the influence of subducting materials and magmatic volatiles. Extremely acidic fluids affected by magmatic volatiles raise the solubility of metals and mobilize them from rocks to fluids (Gamo et al. 1997b, 2006; Gena et al. 2001; Yang and Scott 2006). This aspect of the metal supply may have a great influence on Fe-utilizing ecosystems.

Many more studies on agricultural technology adoption have applied discrete dependent variable models and identified the following drivers: age of the farmer, farm size, exposure to technology, access to credit, farmer√¢¬Ä¬ôs education, access to extension services, gender, household size, income, farming experience, neighbourhood, climatic conditions and agricultural training among others (Boniphace et al. 2015; Fadare et al. 2014; Hailu et al. 2014; Langat et al. 2013; Uaiene et al. 2009; Dimara and Skuras 2003). Although there is general consensus among the researchers with regard to the effect of all the other identified factors on technology adoption, the effect of farm size on the farmer√¢¬Ä¬ôs decision to adopt modern technology has remained unsettled. Akudugu et al. (2012) argue that the effect of farm size on adoption of agricultural technologies can either be positive, harmful or impartial. For example, Langat et al. (2013), Uaiene et al. (2009) and Feder et al. (1985) established a positive association between farm size and technology adoption while Harper et al. (1990) found farm size to have a negative effect on agricultural technology adoption. Other studies even established a neutral relationship between farm size and technology adoption (Fadare et al. 2014; Reimer and Fisher 2014). Despite its extensive nature, literature on drivers of technology adoption in agriculture has its own drawbacks. First, a majority of the studies mainly focussed on drivers of adoption of hybrid seeds (Boniphace et al. 2015; Fadare et al. 2014; Langat et al. 2013; Zivanemoyo and Mukarati 2013; Simtowe et al. 2011) while overlooking farm mechanisation. Only few studies, for example, Akudugu et al. (2012), Uaiene et al. (2009) and Dimara and Skuras (2003) considered farm mechanisation as an equally important type of technology adoption worth to be investigated in farming households. The transformation of communal farmers from subsistence entities into business entities through modernisation of agricultural production systems is essential for improving food security in Africa. An investigation of the determinants of farm mechanisation is therefore critical in the African continent where most of the smallholder farmers are trapped in the traditional production systems."

For instance, plant biomass responses to combined warming and CO2 enrichment treatments often are smaller than anticipated from single-factor experiments (Morgan et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012). Interactions also are evident in driver effects on plant community composition. Responses of foliar cover to experimental warming were species specific in an old field, varied through time, and were contingent on precipitation treatments (Engel et al. 2009). Warming may exacerbate effects of reduced precipitation on rangelands (Hovenden et al. 2008; Sherry et al. 2008), but the ecosystem consequences of the combination of climate change drivers generally are not as extreme as would be anticipated from single-driver effects (Wu et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012)."
391,370,0.919,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"The first technique, called the radon deficit method, assumes that 222Rn and 226Ra are in secular equilibrium in the mixed layer and below, and the observed deficit of radon in the surface ocean is due to evasion of 222Rn out of the ocean (e.g. Bender et al. 2011; Peng et al. 1979; Roether and Kromer 1984). The second technique involves the deliberate simultaneous injection of two volatile tracers with very different diffusion coefficients (3He and SF6) in the mixed layer of the ocean or into coastal seas, and the subsequent monitoring of their concentrations with time (e.g. Wanninkhof et al. 1993; Watson et al. 1991).

Recent molecular data suggest that this separation may be correlated with a higher expression level of layer-4 markers in D2 (Dugas-ford et al. 2012). Confirmation of this division and of its potential functional significance needs additional work. Such gradients of connectivity across the cortical surface (in PCx and DCx) should be clearly described because any horizontal heterogeneity could influence the propagation and reverberation of activity across cortex, under the combined influences of spreading afferent input and widespread associational activity. Given their reciprocal interconnections with high-order cortical areas and a lack of evident sensory topography, PCx and DCx are sometime described as associational rather than primary sensory cortices (Shepherd 2011). The major partners of PCx are the orbitofrontal cortex (Ekstrand et al. 2001; Illig 2006), the lateral entorhinal cortex (Kerr et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2000) and the agranular insular cortex (Johnson et al. 2000). Connectivity to these downstream targets differs between aPCx and pPCx, supporting the notion that they have different functions. Similarly, DCx is reciprocally connected to dorso-medial (DMCx) and medial (MCx) cortices (Ulinski 1977; Desan 1984). Those regions are, on the basis of hodology and position, often compared to parahippocampal and hippocampal opez et al. 2003; Aboitiz et al. 2003). cortices (Desan 1984; Northcutt 1981; L Both PCx and DCx are thus directly connected to associational networks likely involved in controlling or modulating behavior. PCx and DCx are further interconnected with other cortical-like areas that also receive parallel sensory afferents from the OB or the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN), respectively. For PCx, these include the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON; Haberly and Price 1978; Illig and Eudy 2009), the olfactory tubercule (OT; Haberly and Price 1978), and the amygdala (Johnson et al. 2000; Luna and Morozov 2012). AON might be a first stage of odorant-feature processing, in turn used by PCx to detect complex odorant combinations (Haberly 2001; Lei et al. 2006; Kay et al. 2011). DCx√¢¬Ä¬ôs AON equivalent could be the pallial thickening (PT), for it receives direct thalamic afferent input and projects to DCx (Mulligan and Ulinski 1990; Heller and Ulinski 1987). If AON and PT also share functional characteristics, these similarities may point to common elementary processing streams of three-layered sensory cortices. In turtles, visual stimulation triggers propagating waves of neural activity that travel across the cortex. These waves are slower and simpler than those observed in mammalian neocortex. They are accompanied by relatively slow oscillations, which are most prominent in the 20 Hz frequency band. Whereas the so-called gamma oscillations in mammalian cortex are typically around and above 40 Hz, recent results in mice indicate that the 20 Hz band dominates when parvalbumin (PV) interneuron development is artificially arrested, consistent with the above observation that turtle cortex lacks PV interneurons. The computational role, if any, of such dynamics is unknown at present. Progress will require new experimental approaches that allow the simultaneous sampling of large neuronal populations. Specific and data-driven theories of computation in reptilian cortex thus await further study. To the extent that modern reptilian cortex resembles that in the"

Advancements in sensor technologies led to the application of the micrometeorological direct covariance method to estimate air-sea fluxes at hourly time scales on the atmospheric side of the interface. This method was first successfully applied in the GasEx field programmes beginning in 1998 (McGillis et al. 2001; Fairall et al. 2000). The short time scale of the covariance estimates enables observational investigations of the relationship of k to physical/chemical forcing beyond wind speed √¢¬Ä¬ì examples include wind stress, buoyancy flux, surfactants, or surface gravity wave properties. Physically-based parameterisations (Hare et al. 2004; Soloviev 2007; Vlahos and Monahan 2009) are now available that incorporate these additional forcing factors and may lead to quite different transfer properties for different gases. For example, the dependence of bubble-mediated exchange on gas solubility implies the Wanninkhof (1992) formula may not be appropriate for the fairly soluble biogenic gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) (Woolf 1993; Blomquist et al. 2006).

36,382,0.918,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.2 Emerging Viral Diseases: Why Bats? Although bats have been identified as carriers of many highly virulent human pathogens (Chen et al. 2014), evidence of pathogen-related clinical signs or disease in bats is scarce, particularly for intracellular pathogens such as viruses (Brook and Dobson 2015). Post-infection survival is supported by the frequent identification of antibodies to known viruses in apparently healthy bats and longterm survival of these bats (e.g. Hayman et al. 2010). Additionally, viruses isolated or genetically detected from bat populations are highly diverse and often ancestral to related viruses in human and other mammalian species (e.g. Towner et al. 2009; Drexler et al. 2012; Baker et al. 2013a; Tong et al. 2013; Vidgen et al. 2015). Together, these findings suggest a long history of coevolution between many bat-virus relationships identified to date. Recent progress in the field of bat immunology and genomics has identified key differences in bat immunity and physiology that evolved concomitantly with the evolution of flight, resulting not only in apparently increased immunotolerance of intracellular pathogens, but also in increased longevity and decreased tumour production (Baker et al. 2013b; Zhang et al. 2013; Brook and Dobson 2015). Immunotolerance and incomplete clearance of viral infections are also likely to favour the establishment of persistent infections (Virgin et al. 2009), as proposed for a number of bat-borne viruses (Plowright et al. 2015). Various ecological and life-history factors play a key role in the susceptibility of individuals and populations to pathogens (Allen et al. 2009; Turmelle et al. 2010; Schneeberger et al. 2013), and notable differences exist between bats and terrestrial mammals such as rodents (Luis et al. 2013). For example, the often high-population densities and the usually gregarious roosting behaviour of bats increase the likelihood of both intra- and interspecies transmission of viruses (Luis et al. 2013; Streicker et al. 2010). Large-scale movements of bats due to"
36,175,0.918,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"and high densities of dead trees appear to be strongly correlated with the presence of roosts of bark and cavity-roosting bats in forested ecosystems across North America (Mattson et al. 1996; Sasse and Pekins 1996; Rabe et al. 1998; Waldien et al. 2000; Cryan et al. 2001; Bernardos et al. 2004; Broders and Forbes 2004; Miles et al. 2006; Perry and Thill 2007b; Arnett and Hayes 2009). The importance of high roost density has also been reported in Australia. In dry Jarrah forest of Western Australia, both Gould√¢¬Ä¬ôs long-eared bat, Nyctophilus gouldi, and the southern forest bat, Vespadelus regulus, preferred roosting in older forest that contained a much higher density of trees with hollows (16√¢¬Ä¬ì32 trees ha√¢¬à¬í1) than shelterwood creation and gap release sites (8√¢¬Ä¬ì12 trees ha√¢¬à¬í1) (Webala et al. 2010). These mature forest hollow tree densities are comparable to average densities of live and dead hollow trees in roost areas used by Gould√¢¬Ä¬ôs wattled bat, Chalinolobus gouldii, (17 ha√¢¬à¬í1) and the lesser long-eared bat, N. geoffroyi, (18 ha√¢¬à¬í1) in a fragmented landscape in south-eastern Australia (Lumsden et al. 2002). Greater densities of hollow trees likely facilitate roost switching in bark and cavityroosting bats or fission√¢¬Ä¬ìfusion behaviours (Kerth and K√É¬∂nig 1999; Willis and Brigham 2004). These behaviours lead to complex patterns of use and movement among available roost trees by colonies of forest bats. The variation in numbers of roosts between core and peripheral areas of roost networks is further influenced by the density and spatial distribution of available roost trees, as demonstrated for Rafinesque√¢¬Ä¬ôs big-eared bat, Corynorhinus rafinesquii, in south-eastern bottomland hardwood forests of North America (Johnson et al. 2012b). Roost networks of northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, in actively managed forests were scale-free and connected to a single central-node roost tree (Johnson et al. 2012a). A similar pattern was observed for the open-space foraging white-striped free-tail bat, Tadarida australis, in south-east Queensland (Rhodes et al. 2006). Given these patterns, we postulate that implementation of silvicultural systems, which promote retention of higher densities of dead and old living trees across forested ecosystems, should benefit bark- and cavity-roosting bats and facilitate √¢¬Ä¬ònatural patterns√¢¬Ä¬ô in colony behaviours, social interactions, and the use of roost networks."

The Plaquemines barrier system protects Barataria Bay from Gulf waves and currents and extends from Sandy Point (east) to West Grand Terre Island at Barataria Pass (Figure 6.51). Longshore transport is eastward from Barataria Pass and westward from Sandy Point, converging near the eastern end of East Grand Terre Island (Figure 6.51; USACE 2012). Annualized maintenance dredging from the bar channel at Barataria Pass (1996 to 2007) was approximately 140,000 m3/year (183,000 cy/year) (USACE 2010). Of this quantity, about 90,000 m3/year (118,000 cy/year) was sand; however, this quantity is an estimate of gross transport to the pass from east and west. Georgiou et al.

Historical shoreline change rates average about 7.0 m/year ( 23.0 ft/year) (1884 to 2005); however, shoreline recession rates increased to approximately 8.1 m/year (26.6 ft/year) between the 1930s and 2005 (Reaches 44 to 48, Figure 6.49b; Martinez et al. 2009). The Bayou Lafourche barrier system extends approximately 60 km (37 mi) from Barataria Pass (eastern end of Grand Isle) to Cat Island Pass at the western end of Timbalier Island (Figure 6.51). The Caminada-Moreau Headland is included in this coastal segment and contains some of the highest rates of shoreline recession in south Louisiana (11.2 m/year [36.7 ft/year]; Reach 42, Figure 6.49a). Timbalier Island has experienced rapid lateral migration to the west, reflecting the dominant direction of longshore transport west of the Caminada-Moreau Headland (McBride et al. 1992). Based on shoreline change analyses and nearshore sedimentation trends, Georgiou et al. (2005) estimated net longshore transport for this area to be approximately 146,000 m3/year (191,000 cy/year) eastward. According to Rosati and Lawton (2011), net westward transport of maintenance dredging material from Cat Island Pass (Houma Navigation Canal) was about 100,000 m3/year (130,000 cy/year) toward the Isles Dernieres. However, Georgiou et al. (2005) estimates that a maximum of 50,000 m3/year (65,000 cy/year) of sand moves westward along the Timbalier Islands. Based on data from Martinez et al. (2007), historical shoreline change for the Bayou Lafourche barrier shoreline was about 8.8 m/year ( 28.9 ft/year) (1884√¢¬Ä¬ì2005). Shoreline recession rates decreased to about 5.8 m/year (19.0 ft/ year) between the 1930s and 2005 (Figure 6.49b). The westernmost barrier island system along the south Louisiana coast is the Isles Dernieres. In the mid-1800s, the Isles Dernieres (then known as Last Island) was home to the first coastal resort in Louisiana (Davis 2010). At that time, the island was continuous, about 50-km (31-mi) long, and approximately 1 km (0.6 mi) wide. The hurricane of 1856 destroyed the resort community and the island has continued to deteriorate since that time. Although the east-towest longshore sediment transport pathway is well defined for the Isles Dernieres (Figure 6.51), littoral transport rates estimated using wave modeling routines vary from about 33,000 m3/year (43,000 cy/year) (Georgiou et al. 2005) to 60,000 m3/year (78,000 cy/year) (Stone and Zhang 2001). Based on the sediment budget for Cat Island Pass (Rosati and Lawton 2011) developed using survey data, net transport quantities of Stone and Zhang (2001) and Georgiou et al. (2005) likely underestimate annualized transport rates. Historical shoreline change rates ( 11.3 m/year [ 37.1 ft/year]; 1887√¢¬Ä¬ì2005) are of similar order to those recorded for the Caminada-Moreau headland. For the 1930s to 2005 period, recession rates increased slightly to 12.0 m/year (39.4 ft/ year) (Reaches 33 to 36; Figure 6.49b)."

Also the amount of essential fatty acids greatly affects growth and condition of oysters (Pazos et al. 1996). The fatty acid compositions of the European and the Paci√Ø¬¨¬Åc oysters were dominated by 16:0, 20:5(n √¢¬à¬í 3) and 22:6(n √¢¬à¬í 3), major components of phospholipids of typical marine organisms. Both species of offshore-cultivated oysters showed the accumulation of lipids as energy reserves during high food availability from spring to early summer. Diatom markers increased during spring and early summer in both oyster species and suggest a diet rich in diatoms (Pogoda et al. 2013). Increasingly high ratios of (n √¢¬à¬í 3)/(n √¢¬à¬í 6) during the cultivation experiment underline the excellent physiological condition of both offshore-cultivated oyster species (Pogoda et al. 2013; Pazos et al. 1996). The combination of successful growth performance and obviously excellent overall condition of offshore-cultivated oysters resulted in insigni√Ø¬¨¬Åcant mortalities. In contrast to commercial oyster production in nearshore environments, which often suffer from high mortalities, offshore survival rates for both oyster species were high (>96% in 2004, >99% in 2007) and encourage open ocean cultivation (Pogoda et al. 2011). Parasite infestation: Studies on the macroparasite burden of offshore-cultivated European and Paci√Ø¬¨¬Åc oysters and Blue mussels reported a zero infestation at offshore locations in the North Sea (Fig. 11.16a√¢¬Ä¬ìc). In general, parasites can affect condition and health of host animals. Buck et al. (2005), Brenner (2009) and Pogoda et al. (2012) have shown that offshore grown mussels and oysters were free of macroparasites and that infestation rates increased with proximity of the sites to shore, respectively; intertidal mussels and oysters showed the highest numbers of parasites. The debate over the effects of parasites on the energy status and overall health of the host is still open as robust data to elucidate these issues is still lacking. Three major groups of macroparasites are known to infest North Sea mussels and oysters: shell-boring polychaetes, trematodes and mytilicolid copepods. Absence of trematodes at offshore locations can be explained by their complex life cycle: they often infest intertidal gastropods as √Ø¬¨¬Årst intermediate hosts (e.g. Littorina littorea and Hydrobia ulva). These are typical macroparasites of inshore bivalves, which, however, are completely absent in offshore cultivated oysters and mussels. Due to the absence of these exclusively coastal organisms the parasite√¢¬Ä¬ôs life cycle cannot be completed in offshore regions (Buck et al. 2005). Mytilicolid copepods and shell-boring polychaetes (e.g. Polydora ciliata) are abundant in inshore waters (Thieltges et al. 2006). However, their short planktonic larval phase restricts successful dispersion to coastal waters. Larvae drifting away from the coast are bound to die due to predation or starvation in the absence of hosts, which are only available at very few selected offshore culture locations (Buck et al. 2005). These results present a commercial advantage of such offshore shell√Ø¬¨¬Åsh cultures. All known micro- and macroparasites found in European coastal waters are harmless to consumers, but may have negative condition effects (macroparasites) and cause higher mortalities (microparasites) in infested hosts (Brenner et al. 2012)."
233,420,0.918,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Assessing Hotspots of Evolutionary Distinctiveness in New Caledonia New Caledonia is a Paci√Ø¬¨¬Åc Ocean island located some 1450 km east of Australia (Fig. 1). It is about 500 km long and 50 km wide and is classed as a globally signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000; Grandcolas et al. 2008; Kier et al. 2009). The island√¢¬Ä¬ôs biological diversity is threatened by activities associated with large-scale opencast nickel mining, an increased frequency of √Ø¬¨¬Åres, and by ecological displacements caused by invasive species (Bouchet et al. 1995; Beauvais et al. 2006; Pascal et al. 2008; Pellens and Grandcolas 2010). A key feature of the New Caledonian biota is its high level of endemism. The geographical isolation of the island and its ultrama√Ø¬¨¬Åc soils have all been proposed as factors promoting high levels of endemicity. This endemicity exists at the level of the island, but also at √Ø¬¨¬Åner geographical scales, and within New Caledonia microendemism is common with many species restricted to individual mountains, mountain slopes, valleys, watercourses or edaphic √¢¬Ä¬òislands√¢¬Ä¬ô (e.g., Murienne et al. 2005; Sharma and Giribet 2009; Espeland and Johanson 2010b; Pillon et al. 2010; Nattier et al. 2012, 2013)."
230,371,0.918,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"9.2 Larger Plastic Litter Sources. Larger plastic debris originates from maritime activities including shipping, fishing (e.g. Merrell Jr 1980, Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2013; Galgani et al. 2015), recreation and offshore industries (e.g. oil, gas). These sources are, however, likely to be much smaller than terrestrial sources. Whatever the source, larger plastic litter (including millimetre-sized pre-production pellets) is likely to be an important source of microplastic. Irregularly shaped fragments are abundant in intertidal and oceanic habitats with the size-frequency of plastic debris skewed towards smaller debris. This suggests that microplastic can originate from the fragmentation of larger objects that causes ever smaller pieces of plastic to be present in the environment (Browne et al. 2007, 2010; Mor√É¬©t-Ferguson et al. 2010; Collignon et al. 2012; Fig. 9.1a√¢¬Ä¬ìc). Pathways. Fragmentation is the pathway, by which plastic debris breaks into smaller pieces, which is distinct from the more subtle processes of degradation that reduces the molecular mass of plastic debris (Andrady 2011, 2015). These processes occur through the action of light (photolysis), heat and oxygen (thermal-oxidation), water (hydrolysis), organisms (see review by Andrady (2011) for more details about weathering experiments with pieces of plastic >1 mm) and physical abrasion by particles of sediment. Laboratory and field experiments are required to determine the relative importance of these processes in generating the sizes and shapes of micrometre-sized plastic that we find in habitats. One such laboratory experiment by Davidson (2012) showed that each time a single isopod (Sphaeroma quoianum) burrows into a floating dock made of expanded polystyrene they can produce and release between 4900 and 6300 micrometre-sized fragments of polystyrene. There is also a modest literature on plastic degradation in marine habitats (Andrady and Pegram 1989; Andrady 2003; Gregory and Andrady 2003; Corcoran et al. 2009; Cooper and Corcoran 2010; O√¢¬Ä¬ôBrine and Thompson 2010).

241,167,0.918,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"contemporary Baltic Sea basin is part of the last Littorina Stage when signi√Ø¬¨¬Åcant water level and salinity variations took place (see Fig. 2.5). Beetle data from southern Sweden dated to between ca. 11,000 and 9000 cal year BP (Olsson and Lemdahl 2010; Olsson et al. 2010) suggest temperatures of the warmest month similar to present values. The relatively low numbers of aquatic species imply relatively dry and continental conditions. Reconstructed temperatures based on coleopteran data from Abisko are also similar to present temperatures (Buckland et al. 2011). A temperature rise started after 10,000 cal year BP and lasted until the beginning of the cold event at 8200 cal year BP. Over the greater part of southern Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, open boreal woodlands and sparse birch vegetation were established. Summer air temperatures rose by 7√¢¬Ä¬ì10 √Ç¬∞C above the level attained during the Younger Dryas. However, major environmental changes in the area had begun already in 10,300√¢¬Ä¬ì10,200 cal year BP, when deciduous trees including thermophilous species spread into the region. According to data from Lake Ha√Ö¬Ñcza in north-eastern Poland (11,600 cal year BP), the shrub pollen content of lake sediments decreased and a shift from clastic√¢¬Ä¬ìdetrital lake deposits to autochthonous sediments dominated by biochemical calcite occurred at the beginning of the Holocene. Warmer conditions ensued, and between 10,000 and 9000 cal year BP pollen spectra showed an increased content of pollen from broad-leaved trees. The organic content of the lake sediments also increased (Lauterbach et al. 2011). Figure 2.6 shows the reconstructed annual mean air temperature for south-central Sweden based on pollen data from Lake Flarken (Sepp√É¬§ et al. 2005).

285,376,0.918,"Physiology, Psychoacoustics and Cognition in Normal and Impaired Hearing","Tinnitus is a percept of sound that is not related to an acoustic source outside the body. For many forms of tinnitus, mechanisms in the central nervous system are believed to play a role in the pathology. Despite its high prevalence of 5√¢¬Ä¬ì10 %, relatively little is known about the neural mechanisms and causes of tinnitus. Neuroimaging methods have been applied in the last decade to study potential mechanisms, and techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been extensively used to investigate neural correlates of tinnitus. Previously, neuroimaging studies on tinnitus relied mostly on task-related paradigms, such as presentation of sound stimuli that elicit sound-evoked responses, or manipulation of patients√¢¬Ä¬ô tinnitus by somatic modulation (i.e., jaw protrusion or a change of gaze) to temporarily affect patients√¢¬Ä¬ô tinnitus (Lanting et al. 2009). Alternatively, studies focused on anatomical differences in brain structure (Adjamian et al. 2014). However, since a few years, new data-analysis techniques, such as independent component analysis (ICA), have emerged allowing for identification of coherent patterns of spatially independent, temporally correlated signal fluctuations in neuroimaging data during √¢¬Ä¬úresting-state√¢¬Ä¬ù, that is, without a predefined task. These patterns have since been termed √¢¬Ä¬úresting-state networks√¢¬Ä¬ù (RSNs) (Greicius et al. 2004) and represent functionally relevant and connected networks or systems supporting core perceptual and cognitive processes. Resting-state networks are generally reported to show reliable and consistent patterns of functional connectivity (Zhang et al. 2008). Moreover, advances in data-analysis currently allow for between-group analyses where individual networks can be compared across tasks and groups. Recently, resting-state fMRI has been used to investigate functional connectivity differences in individuals with tinnitus (Burton et al. 2012; Davies et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2012; Maudoux et al. 2012a, b). Results indicate differences in connectivity between healthy and affected subject groups. One result showed reduced connectivity between the left and right auditory cortex, indicative of disturbed excitation and inhibition across hemispheres (Kim et al. 2012). A different study found that in individuals with tinnitus connectivity was increased in numerous brain regions, including the cerebellum, parahippocampal gyrus, and sensorimotor areas. Decreased connectivity was found in the right primary auditory cortex, left prefrontal, left fusiform gyrus, and bilateral occipital regions (Maudoux et al. 2012a, b). Very recently, altered interhemispheric functional connectivity was shown and linked with specific tinnitus characteristics in chronic tinnitus patients (Chen et al. 2015a). In addition, enhanced functional connectivity between auditory cortex and the homologue"

142,487,0.918,Subseafloor Biosphere Linked To Hydrothermal Systems : Taiga Concept,"Details of the tectonic background of the southern CIR (Okino et al. Chap. 11) are summarized here. The CIR is characterized by a narrow axial valley with a slow to intermediate spreading rate (47 mm/year full spreading rate at 25 S) relating to movement of the Somalia and Indian/ Capricorn plates. We follow the nomenclature of Briais (Briais 1995) for ridge segments and use the prefix CIR-Sx in this paper. More than 870 kg of rock samples were recovered by dredging during the KH-10-6 cruise along the CIR-S1 to CIR-S4 segments of the CIR. Several dives by the submersible Shinkai 6500 were also performed during the YK05-16 cruise (Kumagai et al. 2006, 2008; Morishita et al. 2009), and the compositions of recovered basalt samples are reported in part by Kumagai et al. (Kumagai et al. 2008) and Neo (Neo 2011). Basalt samples from dive sites 6 K#924, 6 K#926, and 6 K#927 are reported and discussed here. In addition, the characteristics of serpentinized peridotites√¢¬Ä¬îthe dominant lithologies at sites KH-10-6DR19 and KH-10-6DR21√¢¬Ä¬îare discussed by Morishita et al. (Chap. 14). The petrology and geochemistry of MORB around the RTJ that were recovered during the KH-93-3 cruise are reported and discussed by Nakamura et al. (2006). In addition, details of the petrology and geochemistry of MORB from the CIR-S1 segment, including off-ridge samples recovered during the KH-10-6 cruise, will be discussed in future. Previous research (e.g., Price et al. 1986) has also been undertaken in this area, although no studies involving systematic sampling along the southern part of the CIR have been published to date. The locations of dredge and dive sites in this study are given in Table 13.1 and shown in Fig. 13.1, and are described in the following paragraphs. CIR-S1: Dredge site KH-10-6DR7 is located at the northern part of the CIR-S1 segment, with sites KH-10-6DR6, √¢¬Ä¬êDR2, √¢¬Ä¬êDR4, √¢¬Ä¬êDR3, √¢¬Ä¬êDR5, √¢¬Ä¬êDR12, √¢¬Ä¬êDR11, and -DR10 located to the east of the spreading ridge at the off-ridge area of KH-10-6DR7 along the flow line of plate motion. Basaltic lithologies dominate the rocks recovered from the majority of areas, with serpentinized peridotites recovered from sites KH-10-6DR10, √¢¬Ä¬êDR11, and -DR12."

278,336,0.918,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"One of the most important factors determining the carbon footprint of Western households is household income,7 with (as illustrated in Fig. 9.1) household footprints generally increasing with income (Wier et al. 2001; Dey et al. 2003; Weber and Matthews 2008; Buchs and Schnepf 2013; Baiocchi et al. 2010; Gough et al. 2011; Kerkhof et al. 2009; Chitnis et al. 2014). As discussed by Baiocchi et al. (2010) and Dey et al. (2003), this finding dispels the √¢¬Ä¬òKuznets curve√¢¬Ä¬ô theory according to which, as nations become more developed, incomes rise and emissions are hypothesized to fall. Whereas the relationship between income and carbon footprint is strong, studies have shown that as incomes increase consumers tend to shift their expenditures away from carbon intensive √¢¬Ä¬ònecessities√¢¬Ä¬ô towards discretionary expenditures that are generally less carbon intensive (Buchs and Schnepf 2013; Weber and Matthews 2008; Chitnis et al. 2014; Jones and Kammen 2011).
