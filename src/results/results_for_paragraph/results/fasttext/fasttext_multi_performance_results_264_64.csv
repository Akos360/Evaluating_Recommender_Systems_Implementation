Those who prefer precise wording might criticize the use of the expression âlast stepâ because it could be easily misunderstood: namely as the last possible instead of the latest accomplished, as I meant to say here. But there is no mistake in expression. I meant both and especially the last possible step. Instead of an error of style it has to do with a hypothesis, which is being described by this lecture. It appears that we have reached, in elementary particle physics a completely new paradigm, a kind of a terminal situation, in which the question about the composition of matter receives an unforeseen and satisfying answer. This is actually surprising, because we still canât overcome the old difficulties. Whenever someone says to me, that he has now found the true atom, the building block of all matter, I always ask him, then what is this thing made from? One can just read Kant, to see in what sort of cul-de-sac that leads. And now I claim that high energy physicsâperhaps!âoffers a final solution to this dilemma? I do not want to be misunderstood: first, I am making a claim, which is not accepted by all of my colleagues, and second, I do not claim that we are about to understand everything about elementary particles. But this new approach seemsâat least from a particular perspectiveâto offer us the view, which could be used to take the picture."
247,214,0.985,Humanities World Report 2015,"the needs differ immensely across disciplines. Many of our interviewees had very simple demands for such support: (NA11) Office or quiet space. Library with books and Internet access. Computer. We donât need a lot, but thatâs not so true for people doing visual and sound studies and new media. They need more sophisticated computers. All of these things are available on this campus. The notion that the humanities are cheap, as in they do not require a lot of infrastructure, was mentioned by several interviewees. One respondent said: (NA7) Science requires a team of senior investigators and an army of graduates and postgraduates and you need space and expensive equipment. But in the humanities, itâs difficult to recruit grants to remove you from teaching. I am on a number of grant evaluating committees, and we have a deliberate policy of trying to weight our provisions for junior faculty because they really need it. Iâm taking a sabbatical year next year, which is three years overdue. I need to finish a book, and what I need is time to sit at home in my pajamas and write. Weâre about to lose our offices that we have right now, and weâre moving to a new site, which just has cubicles. But that doesnât bother me too much. This sentiment was echoed by a Russian scholar who did not identify any special needs: (R2) Nothing special, actually; every anthropological research is usually done by a single scholar, we do not work in teams as sociologists usually do, so that in this respect we are closer to historians and philologists. Another respondent identified infrastructure as research time: (NA10) I think part of the infrastructure of a university has to be regular time to do research. I think thatâs being questioned, due to a lot of budget cutting. I think universities that can bring in large grants, so itâs the lab sciences. I think the humanities are having a hard time establishing the need to do research. There is a feeling that the research can be done on the side in inexpensive ways. But, of course, it takes time and travel. Our university has dramatically improved its"
143,581,0.984,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"When you say rebel, what do you mean? Rebelling against what? In our society, we were socialized to go to high school, get extremely good grades, go to university (and, in my case, go to the top course), excel in the university, and then be successful. Breaking away from that moldâcoming to terms with the realization that âHang on, this particular path that has been prescribed doesnât actually make sense for me and doesnât fit with my interests and passionsââwas quite a clear departure from the norms of our society at the time. Of course, my dropping out of the university was difficult for my mom, because it is not what people do. Saying, âWell, this doesnât make sense for me; Iâm going to do something differentâ is a form of rebellion. And the way you then express itâand it was not rebellion for rebellionâs sakeâis a very specific reflection of why this was not going to work for me and why there ought to have been a much better, much more exciting path to pursue for my career. What were some of the main learnings you took with you from 3Mice? 3Mice (a Web hosting and design company in Nairobi) was a fantastic learning opportunity because it was the first business I set up. The most important thing I took out of 3Mice is that one can actually do these things and do them well. I think the fact that, from nothing, we set up a business that became reasonably well known in the country was a very powerful lesson. The other lesson unfolded when we became an Africa online company, witnessing a Pan-African business in the making very early on in my career and to see, again, that it can actually be done. The other more practical lessons were on the âhow-toâ side, like how to get products to market and how to build teams. What really matters are people. 3Mice was a partnership of three people, and what got us all excited was creating a company very early on. However, it was a common motivation, a common vision, and a common purpose that kept the partnership alive as the business model changed and evolved. What innately drives entrepreneurs is essentially their purpose and visionââHow big do you want this to go?ââand they are important in keeping things"

But it took me almost two years to clearly define a set of values, because I put so much onus on them that I was scared of not getting them 100 % right. This was actually where I learned the importance of making a decision, even if it is only 80 % right. Now we have a set of five company values that the whole team is proud of (you can find them on our website), and they have really helped me, and the team test culture alignment in interviews, make decisions internally, and know how to act when talking to potential customers. They have become our internal compass. The third would be to complement raising smart money with just money. Smart money is investment in your business that adds value beyond the money itselfâthings like mentorship, for example. Our first round of financing took over five months to close because I would not accept money from an investor unless it was smart money. In hindsight though, there should have been a balance. The last thing I would have done differently would be to leverage mentors and investors more. It is very hard when you are in the weeds of running a business and trying to plow through the next wall ahead to take a step back and gain the perspective you need to steer the ship in the right direction. This is the support that great mentors and investors can provideâsupport that I need more of and support that I need to do a better job of getting. Thanks, Timbo!"

When we had seen each other several times, they sometimes asked me what my research will be about, even though I had told them when we met first. What I was actually doing seemed less important than the fact that I am a midwife. A midwifeâs presence nearby a pregnant or childbearing woman seems to be selfevident. Secondly, trust is intensified in bodily interaction and in relation to the degree of intimacy. Thirdly, trust is a strategy to handle potentially shaming and even molesting situations.16 Helma had been attended by the same midwife during both of her pregnancies, births and postpartum stages. She told me about the âbasic trustâ she would have for her midwife and the midwife would have for her. So I asked her what the midwife did that lets her, Helma, be this confident. Apparently it is more important what Helma herself does in order to establish and maintain a trustful relationship: âI open up completely. But I didnât have any problems with it from the beginning on. You lay down and you are examined [vaginally]. Somehow this is the most normal thing in the world. And that, I think, is so niceâ. Helma describes trust and her capacity to abandonment relating to the midwife in the context of intimate physical interventions. Being examined vaginally out of an explicitly sexual context in agreement with all interactors is just not âthe most normal thing in the worldâ. It seems to be the intimate intervention which âopens up Helma completelyâ. Helma legitimizes the vaginal examination by trusting and by perceiving it as being âthe most normal thing in the worldâ. Samia described it very similarly: âI would say the head was turned off, one simply did what was said, because then one had confidence, too, and one knew that one was in good hands and at the end comes the childâ. Being trustful is also a legitimizing consequence of handing over responsibility to the midwife. Samia is following advice in order to achieve a purpose, which is giving birth to her child. Being trustful seems to be without any alternative. Finally, women expect to have an intensive and trustful relationship with the midwife as DÃ¶rte explained: And that I know somehow for this period I can build up a very intensive relationship. Not only in prenatal and postnatal care but also that in the middle so to speak. That self-indulgence and intimacy somehow. And"

In every work sprint, we define the process of how we are going to work (âBuildâ). Then after the sprint, the whole team reviews how it went (âMeasureâ). And then, we discuss why some things worked and some did not (âLearnâ). If you do this enough times, you will generate a process for running the Lean Start-up principles that is optimized to your business, team, and culture. An entrepreneur is often seen as the individual hero that develops innovative solutions for long-lasting problems. How much is the entrepreneur really that lonesome ï¬ghter as opposed to a function of a wider community eï¬ort? From both working at Google and running OkHi, I have come to realize that every successful business is like an iceberg. I think everyone is guilty of seeing a company that has been successful with just a simple idea and thinks, âWhy didnât I think of that?â or even worse âWait, I had that idea â they stole my idea.â But as someone who knows nothing about that business, all you can see is the tip of the iceberg above the water, the working solution. As soon as you start understanding more about the business, you realize there is so much more to it than you originally thought. Whether it is that they made a big pivot one year into the business (Twitter), had to fire one of the early co-founders (Facebook), or ran out of money and had to sell cereal boxes to make ends meet (Airbnb), every business has so much more to it below the surface. So what I am saying is that it is never just the CEO or co-founders that make the business, it is the whole ecosystem around the business, from the employees to the partners, from the investors to the customers. Especially in the technology sector, the wider community is a hugely important factor to the success of the business, and it is often overlooked because it is one of the parts of the iceberg that remains under the water. While I was at Google, I spent two years leading Googleâs developer outreach efforts across Europe, Middle East, and Africa and gained a unique perspective on seeing what was a small technology community in London in 2008 turn, in just five years, into one of the largest tech"

Where a specialism is underdeveloped or even nonexistent, it is more difï¬cult to relate clinical skills learning directly to CPD frameworks at home. Mental health is a case in point. One mental health nurse suggested that her learning was less focused on improving clinical skills and much more focused on âsoftâ skills.4 We have referred (above) to âexposuresâ outside health workersâ disciplinary specialisms. In many cases these exposures have played quite an inï¬uential role in helping volunteers to make decisions about their future careers â or adding to their CVs to make those decisions possible. The following junior doctor used the opportunity to gain experience in midwifery as the basis for a planned specialism in obstetrics: Iâm almost certainly going to go into obstetrics training when I get back so for now Iâm still quite a general doctor. Itâs good experience for me, practically itâs a lot of hands on stuff, Iâm doing a lot of midwifery work â itâs useful to have that basic background isnât it? When I say basic thatâs a bit rude really, I just mean it will be useful to know how things should work normally compared to when things go wrong so thatâs really useful.

As a result, I got socialized, not just on computers but also on entrepreneurs who were doing interesting things. The cutting-edge technology of the time and the entrepreneurs globally who were not much older than I was made a powerful impression on my mind. So when I went to the pharmacy school after the two years were up, I saw that my mind had started to develop in a completely different direction from that of the medical school culture. This was a very significant culture clash for me. I only lasted about a year and a half and came to the conclusion that this was not going to work. So I and went back to Strathmore for another year! You started working for several Internet service providers (ISPs), and in 1998, decided to make the transition and start 3Mice. Why was it the right time? By the time I left Strathmore, the desire to become an entrepreneurâ like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and the Netscape foundersâhad already settled in my mind to a point of no return. The basic direction, the highest level where one could go in terms of ambition as a technology person, had settled. What does it mean for you to be an entrepreneur? I think I am a rebelâself-directed maybe, but a personality who likes to have his own mind about things. For me, it was never about the money, but rather about the fact that you could, almost from a blank sheet, create and build something, out of your own thoughts, and shape it into whatever it could become. That was a very powerful idea for me. It still continues to drive me today. It is just an innate personality trait. Then seeing other entrepreneurs and what their companies were doing gave this trait a shape and a form of expression. It is like an artistâexcept that an artist expresses himself or herself in, say, a painting. I figured that you could express rebellion, sort of your view of the world, in the ability to create something new and greatâand that you can do that with a business as well. This desire was deeply ingrained in me by the time I left Strathmore."

It just takes your desire and ability to champion something. I will go back into some of the history. So if you look back to 2005, that is when I started blogging about tech in Africa. Fast-forward three years from that, I had written about a lot of start-ups, I knew a lot of people, and I was part of the blogging ecosystem that was really burgeoning at that time. So it was a network of people who knew each other. Then, we came across the post-election violence and craziness that were happening after the elections. Ushahidi was formed, and I was one of the founders. I remember that I came to Nairobi in August of 2008 and was sitting down with a bunch of other guys at BarCamp Nairobi. There was a large turnout. A great amount of interest, and there was everybody present. All the guys who are now CEOs of their own startups in the ecosystem, but we were still just ordinary tech guys at the time. So, we were sitting around afterward, and we were saying, âWhy is it that the tech guys in the city only meet up once or twice a year at these events? What if we had a place of our own?â And that was the seed that would eventually grow to become the iHub. So why did not somebody else do the iHub? Because it is a lot of work to come up with the money, to come up with the bigger vision of where this thing needs to be. And keep in mind that I was running operations for Ushahidi at that time,"

I think weâre well beyond the era in which borrowing methods and discourse from other disciplines makes one interdisciplinary. The bar that I would set today is that you have to be working with other people in different disciplines on common projects. NA10: Interdisciplinary work is almost by definition collaborative, because itâs very hard for people to control knowledge within one discipline, much less many. As8: Even in the single field of linguistics and culture, you may see a single scholar, or indeed scholars from a single country, with a different source of language and materials/resources that are oftentimes different. They have to work together and conduct collaborating research. E13: Iâd divide [interdisciplinarity] into two types: soft and hard. ... Hard interdisciplinarity involves specialists from different disciplines gathering together over a common object or text. As a result, their own individual ways of operating have to change. E2: Of course the term interdisciplinary is vague. Do we mean that scholars of different fields collaborate and that each brings in a specific expertise? Or do we mean, as some people claim, that we need to dissolve the disciplines altogether? (C) Post-disciplinarity: The last extract suggests a different concept altogether, also alluded to by another respondent: E9: Iâve heard the phrase post-disciplinarity used. Iâm not sure I understand it, but I donât think interdisciplinarity will or should take us to a point where disciplinary boundaries actually vanish. We shall leave post-disciplinarity on one side, since it was only of marginal interest to our respondents.7 By contrast, collaborative interdisciplinarity is extremely important to the humanities, as we shall see in more detail below. For the purposes of this chapter we shall refer to it as âmultidisciplinarityâ. One point should be uncontroversial: a multidisciplinary project will require individual researchers to be interdisciplinary in the first sense mentioned above (A)1, and to an extent the second (i.e. using the sources of other disciplines). But it surely does not require the third, (A)3, a strong sense of mastering another discipline; indeed the"

While they may have visited their ancestral homes or other places where co-ethnics reside, these locations do not exercise the same magnetic pull as the Indian ethnic community in the US. Christianity is also a strong force and a key marker against which they measure themselves. Some among this group we call American-centric classify themselves as religious, while others identify thoroughly with the American secular world. Ekata, our first example, is a 22-year-old Hindu who grew up in Oklahoma during the 1990s surrounded by few other Indian American families. She did not learn to speak Gujarati or perform Indian dances like so many other Indian American friends, but she did learn about Hindu mythology by watching religious videos and reading the comic books that an aunt sent. She also learned about Hinduism and what it meant to be pious by watching her mother do pujas (religious rituals and prayers) with family members and friends, listening to her lessons and stories about faith, and observing the priest who came to their home to say blessings on important occasions. Ekata explained, â[My] parents raised me to believe Hinduism is a way of life and not [just] a religion. I feel the most stuff I learned was from watching my parents or listening to them say prayers and learning what it meantâ. Her Christian friends and neighbours also strongly shaped her faith. Attending an Episcopal school as a teenager exposed Ekata to Christian theology and values but also pushed her to clarify what Hinduism meant to her. This prep school was an Episcopalian school. I would go to chapel every day, for years and years. I think that was kind of a good part, figuring out stuff for myself. In some ways, one would think that would be confusing. But kind of having to be surrounded and learning about Christianity is a big thing. The Episcopalian environment helped me realise what I liked about that or what I didnât like about Christianity and then what I liked about Hinduism. Things I was so unclear on, or unsure of."

How much could you rely on investments from Kenya to ï¬nance BitPesaâs operation? I would love to have had local investors invest the whole amount, but I have not found that much financing available for FinTech (financial technology) start-ups. I would love to have not traveled so much away from my family and my business to find investors. There are very few earlytech investors in the region. We have just received financing from a few Nigerian investors, which is exciting because their expertise is essential to our growth across West Africa. What do you think is the missing puzzle piece to get more Kenyan or African investors on-board? Well, there is currently a lot of opportunity in relatively familiar investment options, like real estate. So why would an investor go into an unfamiliar, and seemingly higher-risk, area like tech? Why would they want to invest in a âvery first of its kindâ business? We still need to see more buyouts and M&A activity in the sectorâsome successful exists. I think those exits will act as data points for Kenyan and African investors to realize that FinTech is a viable investment opportunity. You are one of the few tech companies with a female executive team. Was that a coincidence or a deliberate decision? I hired people that were talented and experienced and that I was convinced would work hard to build something new. In Kenya, you often find tech start-ups with groups of friends from high school. I did not go to high school here, so my first hire was a fellow financial services consultant, Charlene Chen, with whom I had worked on a few projects over the years. Similarly, our second hire was forex trader Amy Ludlum, who had a stellar finance background at a major global bank but was highly motivated to work for a start-up.

Reï¬ecting upon the past years, can you point out one of the biggest âAha!â moments that you have had? I think it is different for each stage when you are part of growing an ecosystem. I have been here for five and half years now. There are different things that happen throughout that time, and there are different things that matter, depending on the stage that we were in. The first âAha!â moment was that this little idea of having a physical space would be good for the community. The âAha!â moment was, âHoly crap, weâre oversubscribed by 2,000 people and, yeah, it worked.â The insight was thisâthat, yes, actual face time with people is important, even for technologists! I had a conversation with Eric Schmidt of Google on his visit a couple years back. We were sitting downstairs grabbing lunch at Peteâs, and I mentioned the numbers we were seeing and the success rates of those companies being around 10 to 15 % for their first year. He responded that in Silicon Valley, the numbers are much, much higher, but the success rates are even lowerâmeaning that we should expect to put out many more companies if we want to see a few succeed at a very large level. This was the âAha!â moment tied to the need to generate more start-ups. It is a numbers game. So how do we help get more things started? We understand many will fail and that is fine. But the more we get out there, the better. It is like if you want the real, sort of bigger investors to come off the sidelines and jump into the system for more start-ups to scale, then we need at least one of them to exit at maybe USD20 million in order to prove to people that there is something here. That is what the ecosystem is figuring out right now. For the iHub, the âAha!â moment came as we realized that we did not have to charge our members if we come up with a service model that allows us to charge for other services, such as consulting. That is why we built the iHub Research arm, the UX Lab, and iHub Consulting. These"

Sometimes I pair the video with a poem by American poet Lawson Fusao Inada, âTo Get to Fresnoâ [23]. Inada was born and raised in Fresno, California, except for the three years from 1942 to 1945 that he spent in a concentration camp for Japanese Americans. But he left Fresno after college, and never returned. So the poem, âTo Get to Fresno,â is about how to remember and cherish a home/land that you have left permanently. Inada takes us on a trip around the world to enact the knowledge of different cultures and universal human being that Fresno gave him, and still gives him, whenever he chances to re-call this place in his heart. The poem leads us on a slow journey around the world, from Fresno to Fresnillo, Mexico, to the Ganges River, to Zimbabwe, to Moscow, to the tundra with its polar bears, and to many other places along the way, before returning to Oregon where Inada made his second home. I was hoping to get everyone to think about what it means to leave a home/land forever, and yet to remain there forever in heart and mind, and what it means to enter this phenomenon as a bystander. What does it mean for us in Tokyo, post-3/11, âto get to Fukushimaâ? Sometimes I pair the video with a classic American picture book called A Tree Is Nice, written by Janice May Udry and illustrated by Marc Simont [24]. This is the first book I remember borrowing on my own from the public library in Kapahulu, Oahu, where I lived from age five through eight. My mother read it to me countless times, and later I read it for myself many more times. Trees are nice, we read and see, because they give us apples and a place to hang a swing, play pirate, or sit and think. They protect cows from the noonday sun, our homes from winter storms, and cats from dogs. We can rake up leaves in the fall and build a bonfire, or draw pictures in the sand with fallen branches. Trees make everything beautiful, we read and see, and if we plant a tree, we can watch it grow up year by year and point proudly to it, saying, âI planted that tree.â As a child I loved this book with a fierceness not easily articulated in words even now. I was able to buy a copy of it when I was in my thirties, after I happened upon it by chance in Maruzen Bookstore in Tokyo, some time during the first years after my move to Japan in 1987 and well before Amazon.com could prevent me from experiencing such joyous serendipity. I like to think that teaching Fukushima alongside A Tree is Nice or âTo Get to Fresnoâ is an act of remediation of the sort I am capable of in my line of work,"

Oscar was part of an old boyâs colectivo in 23 de Enero, which for decades has been central in organizing cultural, sportive and social events in the community. They set themselves apart from many other colectivos in the community by their explicit non-militant style. Also, they were hesitant to tie themselves too closely to the new arenas for popular participation endorsed by the government. Rather, they considered popular struggle as essentially a process of bottom-up emancipation from both cultural and political modes of dominance and power. Consequently, Oscar and his comrades were deeply worried about many of the âvicesâ that continued to thrive within the Bolivarian movement, and the obstacles this posed for continuing political struggle beyond having a sympathetic government in power. He saw ideologies of consumptions as one of the most worrying signs of the limitations to the Bolivarian revolution as a process of deep socio-cultural change: What can we do if there is this constant; the television, the internet, the mobile telephone in fashion. I mean, here people are saying that this is the country with the largest acquisition of new mobile telephones (smart phones) and in the communities, you get shocked how this is instilled in our young women, in your children, that the Christmas presents, from the Jesus Child2 in quotation marks, the arrival of these gifts from Christmas are telephones, they are giving a Blackberry to a child of seven, eight years â¦.

Iâm familiar with analogue research, so I know about and can be critical of the hierarchy of sources available on the Internet. Not all sources are on the same level. Itâs often difficult to get students to understand that. ... some younger researchers lack a critical sense of the sources, because they have not worked enough with analogue material; they attempt to minimise the qualitative assessment of sources. Af1: Digitisation tends to produce the younger âcut and pasteâ scholars, too lazy to do actual under-the-hood, retro research, they surf Google books, cut and slice expressions and segue them into a conference paper. ME4: As regards research, digitisation does not necessarily save time. The facility of digitisation makes you keep searching, and so makes you avoid the moment when you need to think and write. (Itâs easier to read on a computer than to think and write.) Digitisation doesnât affect or reduce the real effort required for research. In the end itâs got to be your own work. As13: It seems that researchers read less and have less incentives to work on something really deep or taking a lot of time.

237,121,0.978,The Academic Book of the Future,"By working closely with publishers and academic staff, the availability of custom books and âbook bundlesâ ensure good value. Our bookshop benefits immensely from its inclusion within the Department of Library Services at CCCU. Our staff regularly help students search the library database. Libraries do not put bookshops out of business. Where texts are too expensive, they can be borrowed or accessed; but ebook users continue to use bookshops. Approachable and knowledgeable booksellers are crucial. It is necessary to pass the âgood bookshop testâ â is being able to âfind books when you are not looking for anything in particularâ or books the browser âwouldnât have found on their ownâ. This âbrowsabilityâ was more recently termed by Mark Forsyth as âthe unknown unknownâ, in a specially commissioned Books Are My Bag promotional title.4 The online bookseller equivalent is their âalso boughtâ selections. The bookshop offers a valuable physical space when it comes to taking time out from the pressures and demands of everyday academic life; it is âa place for staff and students to wander among ideas and to generate chance sparks of inspirationâ. The university bookshop is an âessential part of the student experience at CCCUâ but also âsupports the teaching and research of staff magnificentlyâ as illustrated in the following anecdotes: Recently, I tried to buy an obscure, almost out of print book on Elizabeth I from a) Amazon and b) the Publisher to no avail (they only had three copies and couldnât find them). The CCCU bookshop was the only outlet that found me a copy, I rest my case. I know that I can ask for a book that the library do not stock and you can find it and have it âin Houseâ within days. This makes my work more research focused, more up to date and more effective. It is something I particularly value, even if I am not sure of the title and only know I need a book by Husserl!! Only this morning I was approached after class by an anxious international student who needed some reading guidance and wanted titles recommended to her. I was able to walk her into the bookshop and put the appropriate volumes straight into her hand. Problem solved."

I will never forget the puzzled looks on their faces. âWhy bother?â, they asked. âYou know as well as we do that Georgia will not have 24-hour electricity supply in our lifetime.â This was coming from the top specialists in the ï¬eld, people who had worked in the energy sector for much longer than I had, and who knew the Georgian electricity system much better than I did at the time. Within 18 months of this conversation, 24-hour power supply had become a reality, and in 2007, we were exporting electricity to our neighbors. This experience taught me to see opportunity where others see nothing but obstacles. I made it my mission to inspire others to think that anything is possible, and that a vision can become a reality if the best people pull together to make it happen. In 2004, nobody could imagine that Georgia would one day become a regional tourist hub, let alone one of the worldâs top tourist destinations. When President Saakashvili ï¬rst proposed an investment program to develop the tourism infrastructure in Batumi, a port on the coast of the Black Sea, almost everybody was skeptical. Nobody believed that such an effort could possibly amount to anything. Back then, Georgia was widely considered unsafe for foreign visitors, a fundamental issue for any budding travel destination. There were unresolved geopolitical problems in our relations with Russia. Some territories were (and still are) occupied by the Russian army. There was also no tourism infrastructure to speak of.

56,335,0.977,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"when I told my respondents that I was a student or a researcher (chercheur), it did not necessarily mean very much to them. Taking the literal meaning of the term, they would ask me, âMais quâest-ce que tu cherches ici?â [But what are you looking for here?] In some cases, such complete unfamiliarity with the idea of academia or research had a significant bearing on the degree to which I was able to secure informed consent, as will be discussed below. Suspicion could come in other forms. On several occasions residents displayed a great deal of apprehension about my motives, alleging that I was a spy sent by one of the social security agencies to inform on them. This suspicion is understandable given the climate of distrust which reigned in certain establishments and the practices adopted by certain agencies to crack down on benefit fraud (for manifestations of this mutual distrust see Chap. 3). A number of respondents voiced concern about the confidentiality of their testimony, despite my best efforts to assuage these doubts. The following exchange with one respondent â Mehdi â is indicative of such suspicions, as my field notes record: I asked if it would be OK to record the interview. Mehdi said some very interesting things about this: to do a recording was âtrop graveâ (too serious). If we made a recording, then the government would listen to it and they would try to get him in front of a judge or deport him for something he had said. I said that he could remain anonymous if he wished, but he said no, the government can recognise you just by your voice. He then started talking about how he is a delegate for his comitÃ© dâentreprise [staff council is perhaps the nearest translation], he has been a delegate for ten years now, and every time there is a meeting the boss asks if he can record the conversation, for the minutes, but he always refuses. Again, because he is scared of the consequences: the boss could easily mess around with the recording, edit it or add words and then he would be up in front of a judge. He is very suspicious of the current government; he is sure that they are against immigrants, and are looking for any reason to deport people, including older people. âIls prÃ©fÃ¨rent que nous crevons lÃ -basâ [âtheyâd prefer that we snuff it back homeâ]. Again very interestingly, he said that if there was a âseriousâ government in charge â âif the Socialists were in chargeâ â then he would have no problem giving a recorded interview. I replied that I understood entirely, that it was up to him to decide and that I respected his decision.2"

You have angel investors starting to come from other markets. And this is all happening at the same time. What hasnât happened yet is there havenât been many successful exits from the technology community because itâs so young. And because of that, you donât have many first-generation tech entrepreneurs that are wealthy enough to invest in the next generation. So we need a big exit, and then we need the members of that community to become the PayPal Mafia. Thatâs the missing element. Five years from now, Iâd love to see our earliest employees behind the biggest startups on the continent. Thatâs my personal vision of success. How essential are investors from Africa to realize that vision? I donât think itâs about creating African investors or Silicon Valley investors or European investors. I think itâs about learning a skill and paying that skill forward irrespective of region or nationality. We built a company from the ground up in Nairobi. Thatâs what we know. As weâve grown, weâve seeded partnerships and cut our teeth throughout the continent. So Iâm not on a mission to create âAfrican investorsââIâm on a mission to create entrepreneur-investors that know their markets better than anyone else. Should ICT ventures aim at becoming strategically valuable for a foreign buyout, reach for an international IPO, or simply not worry about it because other things matter? What is your strategy? Thereâs a saying that âcompanies are bought, not sold.â I think thatâs true. Our main priority has been to build a big, defensible company. With defensible I mean that weâre in the business of digging moats to protect our castle from attack. A company that is not defensible cannot withstand attack, or direct competition. In other words, to be defensible means that you have to capture a market segment quickly, patent some kind of unique IP, or jump over a material barrier to entry. Defensible companies are hard to replicate or attack. Weâve made mistakes along the way in terms of prioritizing incorrectly. For example, we scaled prematurely.

The other issue I feel we have with the education system is its outright bias toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Do not get me wrongâI think STEM is very important. But I also feel that the humanities, arts, and physical education are just as important. Again our kids have been conditioned to grow up to become doctors and engineers. In Kenya, the exit point from primary school is a nationwide examination called the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education. Millions of students appear for this exam around November, and by January, the results are out. There is generally much fanfare, and the highest-scoring students are identified, celebrated, and interviewed. And every year, without fail, these kids are asked what they want to be when they are done with education. They invariably respond with some variation on doctor, surgeon, engineer. I cannot recall ever hearing any of these kids say they want to be poets or dancers or artists. In our schools, a smart kid is one who is good at math or science; a kid who is good at drawing, curiously, is referred to as âtalented.â But not smart. For society as a whole to flourish, each of these disciplines brings something to the table. We need STEM. But we also need arts. And physical sciences. And humanities. A holistic approach to our development capacity. How will more âcuriousâ students graduate from the education system? I have always felt that the really good teachers can only be truly recognized after they have left their students to themselves. Allow me to explain what I mean by that. Given that our education system is optimized around passing exams, anyone with a good memory can cram facts and dates and regurgitate them at exam time. But knowing facts and understanding and internalizing them is a different kettle of fish. Good teachers plant a seed in your head, and usually you are blissfully unaware of it. They instil curiosity. Curiosity is what will make you go to the library and look for books on how electricity works. Not because there is an exam or because you have been asked to. You have gone on your own because you simply want to know. Things you learn out of curiosity, or genuine passion, stick in your head a lot longer than those bullet points you crammed to pass an exam and almost immediately forgot. This model of a teacher standing in front, rapping out notes, and then students regurgitating the same notes back at them during exams needs to be reviewed. I have interviewed software"

(Interviewee 18) (114) I think these results [in relation to the comment âOnly a dead Muslim is a good Muslimâ] make sense, if we take into account the Cypriot history; because I think most people do just that. When most people hear talk about Muslims, they think one is talking about terrorists. Basically, they donât know that Muslims also have a problem with terrorists too. And all this is also associated with Turkey, because of the invasion, and they donât see Muslims as individuals. (Interviewee 16) It, therefore, seems that, much like race, our interviewees also take religion to be a fundamental element of an individualâs identity, which may not deï¬ne him/her as a person, but will at least deï¬ne the relationship they will have with him/her. In example (115), a member of the Christian Arabic minority, called the Maronites, is described as being the victim of threats and abuse, only because of his or her religion: (115) Interviewee In my class we had a Maronitis, they are a minority in Cyprus.

Going through Azerbaijan would take much longer. To buy us some time, we announced an ad hoc bank holiday. When the plane from Vienna ï¬nally landed at Tbilisi airport, I was there with an escort of eight special operations soldiers. I hadnât told anyone where we were going, or what we were transporting. Driving around a war zone with USD 100 million in cash is, well, a little risky to begin with, but telling people about it would have turned the operation into a downright suicide mission. As it happened, we delivered the package safely to the vault of the National Bank. I instructed the banks to re-open earlier than usual the next day to show everyone that there was no shortage of cash. The main concern was to avoid that lines of people would snake out of the banks. The banks managed it well. Some banks even gave cash to their employees and had them deposit it in their accounts for everyone to see, saying that they had withdrawn it that morning, that there was no issue with the supply, and that their money would be safer in their accounts than in their homes. By the end of that day, people started bringing back cash and depositing it in their accounts. The crisis was averted. Not one request by international depositor or investor was delayed for a minute. I turned my attention to the remaining USD 250 million. I had the cash ï¬own to Baku, Azerbaijan. Ale, Georgiaâs minister of energy, was still in Baku at the time. I called him on a secure line at the Georgian Embassy there and briefed him on the situation. I asked him to pick up the cash at Baku airport and bring it to the Azeri-Georgian border where I would meet him. âAle, listen carefully. When you leave the embassy, you will not have access to a secure line. So when you call me from your mobile, donât mention the money. Letâs call it the guest. When you tell me that the guest has arrived, I will know that you have the cash. When you tell me that the guest is feeling well, I will know that you have counted the cash and it is all there.

I explained that even I, a non-developer, had had a lot of fun participating in a session of Llewellyn Falco and that I would like to try it with the teams. I told them I thought it would be fun, and mentioned similarities I saw with some of the online games that I knew the junior team members liked playing in their own time. These games are high paced shoot-âm-ups, in which they acted as a team with a lot of online communication, and I hoped the similarities would spark an interest. A second argument was, via feedback in the retrospectives the teams had raised, that there was lot of difference in the skill level and use of tools between the team members, regardless of seniority and time with the company. Everyone agreed that it would be in the interest of the teams, the individuals and the company to spread those skills more evenly. I emphasized how Mob Programming could help us achieve this. Still, the ï¬rst reactions were lukewarm. Even while stressing that the goal was learning and not delivery, people were complaining about the apparent lack of efï¬ciency. A senior colleague, who was not part of these teams but influential in the company, openly said he would dislike working on a daily basis as was shown in the video. I stressed that if people liked this way of working we could do it more often, but that it was not my goal to make this the new default way of working in the ofï¬ce.

21,106,0.977,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"achieve this in those days was really very complicated. Dave De Roure managed the technology at our end. I donât know who managed it in the U.S., but it was quite an achievement and it all worked amazingly well. The Web community is a very different community from the hypertext community culturally, and I donât know how much they understood of what Ted said in his keynote. The most memorable thing for me were the words Ted used to close his keynoteâgiven to a hypertext community in Southampton but addressed to the Web community in Santa ClaraââYour future is my past.â That is so very true, but even now most people in the Web community have no idea just how true it is. As I reflect on how the Web has developed over the last 25 years, I see the ideas that Ted had 30, 40, 50 years ago emerging because they have to emerge. But itâs taken a long while, and whilst I love the Web for all itâs given us I also understand exactly how it slowed things down as well. I felt this with the Microcosm project too. There was another major seminal moment for me at WWWâ98, which was in Brisbane. Three things happened at that conference as I recall. Tim started talking about the Semantic Web again in his keynote for the conference. He had talked about it at the first WWW conference in 1994 [1] and the idea of making links on data in the information management proposal he wrote in 1989. As far as he was concerned in 1998, the web of linked documents was beginning to emerge but his vision wasnât complete until it was also a web of linked data, and so he started to re-educate the community about this at the Brisbane conference. Ted was also at the Brisbane conference to pick up a special award. I remember him demoing ZigZag to us in the bar one night at that conference. He was so excited, and we were all mesmerized. So I had heard Tim talk about the Semantic Web and I saw Ted demo ZigZag at the same conference, and I didnât fully appreciate either of them at the time. I understood the principles, but I didnât understand the detail. Itâs taken me a long time to appreciate both the Semantic Web and ZigZag, but as my understanding of both of them has increased I now firmly believe what I suspected all along: there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two ideas, and that you can implement ZigZag in the RDF graph. Someday Iâll find the time to prove that. I need to get Ted involved in making that happen. I really believe that these two amazing peopleâTim and Tedâhave the same idea of how you can make links on data to create an incredibly rich hyperstructure for generating knowledge. Tim will never talk about it like that. His idea with the Semantic Web is that machines can, if you describe the data using a vocabulary like an ontology, make inferences about the information contained in the data that couldnât be made in any other way. This is what Ted said in the paper he sent us about his closing keynote for this event, that actually if you take all these ideas to their extreme we will generate more knowledge. The other thing I remember about the WWW conference in Brisbane is that this is where Sergey Brin and Larry Page published their paper about the algorithm that became the Google search engine. So for me this really was a seminal conference with so many truly ground breaking ideas emerging at the same time, apparently orthogonal to each other but actually all the same thing as time has confirmed, since"
117,53,0.977,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"The General Phenomenology of Care Care is always initiated by an appeal. Something appeals to usâperhaps purely coincidentally. I then allow this appeal to become a matter of my concern. In accordance with this concern, I develop a volition: I want that which promotes the thrivingâeven to the smallest extentâof that which has appealed to us, that which concerns us, regardless of how I may establish what that entails. Eventually I take practical action. This connection is what I refer to as care.2 Perhaps I hold on to the object of my care in the future and the care becomes love (Freter 2016, pp. 351â363), or perhaps, as the case may also be, I immediately release the source of the appeal from my care again and send it on its way. In the following section, I will attempt to show how this basic phenomenological structure can indeed be derived from a famous literary account, namely the âGospel According to Lukeâ, in the so-called Parable of the Good Samaritan."

That was all he ever gave out. I asked one of the partners, âWhatâs this all about?â He said, âThatâs all he ever uses, those twenty drugs.â23 A number of doctors pointed out that tonic preparations often acted as a kind of placebo and that in some respects the demand for them was patient-led. Stanton recalled: They might actually come in and one of the words that people used was âDoctor, I think I need a tonic . . .â which of course was put into their minds, because doctors prescribed a tonic. âLetâs go down [to] the doctor and get a tonic, then Iâll feel betterâ. So we responded to that. I mean that, that was the traditional approach.24 Giles Walden described a very similar situation: All they wanted was their bottle of the usual red stuff, or green stuff [laughing] â or even the blue medicine. âThatâs all I want Docâ â you know. And this used to be prescribed and off they went. And to begin with there was little emphasis on trying to find out what it was for or why they needed it. I sort of found myself having to go along with this to begin with . . . but I soon began to question what it was that we were dishing out, and for me, things began to change.25 As new drugs for anxiety and depression were developed, the range of treatments became increasingly sophisticated and general practitioners (GPs) were largely required to do their own research into the"

This is a pet peeve of Tedâs. But in this animation, they are just objects, and any object can talk to any object. Iâll take a look at the menu of the animation window. We can stop it ticking, and we can single-step the frame we care about. Maybe we want to share this frame with a painting tool. If this was prepared ahead of time, it would already be done. Instead, to paraphrase Thoreau, we need to find out what Texas might have to say to Massachusetts; that is, how did each of the tools characterize their parts and behaviors. Then we can do what Ted loves, shown in Fig. 3.8, which is to draw a line between the two windows. Some of the actions can be pre-defined, but we can also define one later by doing this gesture to create a dynamic link between the two windows. The painterâs picture wants to be linked to the bouncing windowâs current frame, so we just write that in there and do it. The animation can be started again, and I can start painting the deformed ball. In the end, it starts to look pretty good.

117,164,0.976,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Work on Wanting: Sociomaterial Will-Work Before going into the ethnography of ADL encounters in which wanting is aligned, I want to highlight two methodological interventions that I make with this chapter. Firstly, I contend that the term âwillâ suggests a coherence that hides the relational nature of coming to want something. I therefore suggest that, rather than understanding the will as something we âhaveâ, we should understand it as something we âdoâ in unfolding sociomaterial interaction. Secondly, since my interest here is in understanding the alignment that is strived for in the process of wanting in dementia care settings on a daily basis, I differentiate between âwillingâ and âwantingâ. I separate a more cognitive intending, pertaining to the realm of the legal and long-term decision making (âwillingâ), from a more immediate, emotionally and physically informed activity (âwantingâ). I understand wanting10 to be a fundamental expression of subjectivity, including activities such as desiring, longing, wishing and, significantly, not wanting, which is done in unfolding sociomaterial interaction on an everyday basis."

However, through a social network I put it [the comment] on and thatâs it. Saying things behind [other peopleâs backs] is much easier. (Interviewee 2) Current research has shown that there is no single proï¬le of a hater or cyberbully who is concealed under the cloak of anonymity. Even though there are organised groups that seek to promote hatred online, in most cases the people that hide behind hateful or discriminatory trolling messages are not linked to openly intolerant ideological movements (cf. Isasi and Juanatey 2016), but are instead users who just do not realise the potential impact of their digital activity, and the effects that it can have in the offline world (cf. Stein 2016): (130) Because on the Internet it seems that the thing is diluted, people feel shielded behind their computer, and I am here in my house in Toledo, no matter who reads this. The one who reads it will be far away, so nothing will happen.

Interviewee 3 Well, I suppose that it is bad. Evidently you wonât like anyone who speaks badly about you. Surely then that, as we are in the society that we are, will affect your private life. I donât know, I imagine, I donât know what measures should be taken: closing Facebook or changing names or changing friends on Facebook.

Some people said she should engage more in that discussion and take a stand on the proposals. But you know, these people are mathematicians. If they want to call their models âBoserup modelsâ, why should I be against it? I get a chance that others are becoming interested in what I have to say.

The increasing formalization of society (Adler Lomnitz 1988), for example through the âexplosion of rulesâ (Ahrne and Brunsson 2004), was able to provide a background for how the possibilities for transacting svart arbete also increase. It does not erase svart arbete, just makes it look different. Informal transactions of work flourish not only between people who are socially related or within interest-based groups. Instead they can almost become the norm, feasible between complete strangers. Swedes wanting to acquire a service svart rarely have a problem finding one. Limningers who want to buy services svart only need to ask cautiously, in ambiguous language: I donât need an invoice, but can I get a jolly good price or can you do it at the weekend? BÃ¶rje sums up what many seem to believe. People have always exchanged. Itâs a natural part of life: You fix this and Iâll fix that. But I do not think thatâs working svart, although it is in the grey zone. If you are tough [on interpreting the law]. I think itâs congenial with this market trade. Because thatâs what it is.

Nor do people pay tax simply because they get something in return that is solely for their own personal benefit or because they think that the nation they reside in is utterly fantastic. It is more complicated; our willingness to pay tax depends on combinations of these factors including how tax laws are written, how these laws are interpreted and put into practice when collecting tax, but also on how this revenue is spent. Research about tax compliance thus points to many, many explanatory factors addressing economic, legal and social issues. Some of this research has in various ways used reciprocity as a causal factor, yet in quite different ways. I proposed that there are four types of reciprocity. A tit-for-tat relationship expects something in return for taxes paid. This is not entirely instrumental (although it can be applied as such), but is also a strategy for giving a very clear message that I as a taxpayer expect something in return. The copy-cat relationâs reciprocal content is in doing what others, in a similar position to me, do. If I pay my taxes so will others, and likewise if they pay so will I. Closely related to this is paying my fair share. If we all provide what we owe into the same treasure chest, I trust that its content will be distributed for all providersâ benefit. Finally, it is a question of equalityâof being treated in the same way as all other taxpayers, including the revenue collector. The latter has, as a governmental institute, access to an enormous amount of knowledge, and can also abuse its powerful position. These four categories of reciprocity obviously overlap. That I desire something in return for the taxes I pay does not have to be only for my individual benefit; I might require the revenue to be spent on societal issues that I value and hold dear. Similarly, a tit-for-tat expectation can go hand in hand with all taxpayers being treated equitably and that other citizens get their fair share. What we have seen from the Swedish example is that the everyday exchanges that create reciprocal relations between peopleâtaxpayersâare often forgotten in tax compliance matters. Perhaps researchers are too busy concentrating on taxation from a stateâs perspective.1 Such a perspective omits and forgets what citizens do every day in privateâoutside the realms of the state. Yet such practices also have an impact on tax compliance. It is a sort of tit-for-tat reciprocity where the state is left out of the deal. I call it a quid pro quo reciprocity as it does not have a vestige of a revenge element in it as the tit-for-tat varieties have. People continuously exchange for all sorts of reasons and with various intentions. They engage"

When assessing the potential candidates for recruitment all information available was used, including formal applications and written testimonials from previous workplaces. However, written testimonials could have strings attached. A good testimonial, for example, could turn out to be an attempt to save the face of an incompetent employee and avoid problems which would have resulted from his firing: [Y]ou have to fire a person. He says OK, gets up, leaves his resignation of his own free will and saves his face. You will save his face. He could say that I wonât resign, fire me according to the laws. He takes the issue to court after which the real show begins. He will say that you are paying salaries under the counter. And you will say that I will send 13-year-old hooligans to your home to explain to him where to look for his salary (â¦) who needs this? You will write him a letter of recommendation (â¦) and he continues on the markets, shows the letter. (general director, p3) Moreover, in a formal testimonial the image given of the evaluation target is positive and flawless. The possible failures, conflicts, and other shortcomings at work have been excluded, whereas in an informal recommendation both pros and cons of the target can be dealt with. Because a testimonial as a rule is written to an anonymous reader, it implies a different kind of responsibility than an informal recommendation given in a brokerage chain to an old acquaintance or friend: If for example one of my former employees is looking for job in some firm and asks for a recommendation (â¦) if he does not ask anything supernatural, Iâll write a recommendation regardless of how our work relationship ended.

You might call it human-centered problem solving. Leaders who found a clear purpose, built empathy, and continuously learned, were able to organize their teams to solve what often seemed like impossible challenges. For instance, I recently left a meeting with Ratan Tata [former chairman of the Tata Group of Mumbai] awestruck by his masterful use of purpose, empathy, and learning to solve one challenge after another. Tataâs Nano project started as a sketch in his diary of a moped with a shield. Seeing families of four piled together, unprotected from wild traffic in the middle of often harsh Indian weather, was unacceptable. He believed every family should have access to safe transit. Tata took the sketch to his colleagues to experiment on solutions for what would ultimately become the worldâs most affordable car. His efforts have shocked automotive manufacturing and, more important, improved transportation safety for thousands. The thing is, despite all his success, he spent most of the conversation inquiring about us. I have never met a more humble and curious person. I walked away realizing his practice of humility and curiosity was what actually allowed him to notice his surroundings and continue to learn (at age 77!). Humility and curiosity were the foundation of Tataâs personal legacy of success. Looking back, it seemed nearly all our successes, on seemingly impossible challenges, involved leaders who valued humility and continuously learned.

With each project we would like to ensure a better starting position for the future. Sometimes collaborations or just research projects themselves turn out not to be what we were expecting. Still we want to recognize their potential benefits for our long-term vision and turn them into success. If we are putting our time and resources into something, we should do it honestly rather than minimizing the efforts needed to fulfill the requirements or just ensuring a few more months or years of funding for the people. We want to reach the goal with people improving in knowledge/experience, consciousness, happiness, richness. After finishing a research project people should have more individually and as a group. Similarly as in any business collaboration, also in research we should keep going until everybody walks away feeling goodâwe achieve a win-win situation, everyone wins and there are long-term benefits. This may take efforts, especially as there is often a limited time frame, but that is where the true leadership takes place. In any relationships, it is good to be kind, show gratitude, acknowledge contributions and thank people for their contribution whatever it is. We all like when our contribution is recognized, even if we do not work for that recognition. When we express our gratitude people are inspired to keep collaborating and contribute even more. To be successful in what we are doing we look at merging our goal and our life while keeping a good balance and no separation of all the ingredients. We know from our own experience as researchers that our research is with us all the time and often some of the best ideas we get outside the office hours. As suggested by Mladenic in an interview (Brodnik et al. 2006) âbeing a scientist is more a way of life than occupationâ."

This highlights how reï¬ective observation gained within one context can allow learning from concrete experiences to be applied to another: I think about it all the time when Iâm on placements [in the UK]. Itâs just so different; weâre all patient centred, patient focused, whereas over there itâs more like task focused, like get the job done. And I mean, donât get me wrong, I think a lot of nurses over here can get like that too, when your workload is so big you can be like: âOh, you know we need to get this done, this done and this doneâ and when youâre busy you know it can be like that, but I think thatâs what itâs taught me as well, try to take your time with your patient and just explain what youâre doing and, you know just have a chat and things like that.

Luke 10, 29 and 10, 36 ff.)), and the beaten man simultaneously becomes his closest (cf. Wolter 2008, p. 391). The Samaritan does not want the injured man to continue to be in the state in which he has been: He does not want that which is. The concern has been compressed, has been turned into volition, substantiated to a volition: to a volition for the sake of the concern. The condition of the injured man ought to improve. It ought, therefore, to be different. It ought not to be as it is. This seems to us to be of decisive importance. The Samaritan takes issue with the situation as he finds it. He sets his will against that which is. This appears to be one important source of the ought: when I posit my will, as it arises from my being, against that which is, when I say: it ought not to be so, but rather how I, for the sake of the other person, want it to be. And this will for the sake of another, I suspect, is a preliminary form of the ought. Thus the Samaritan takes practical action, and as the story continues, he âbound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him [ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼ÏÎµÎ¼ÎµÎ»Î®Î¸Î· Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿¦. et curam eius egit]â (Luke 10, 34). The care-giver then releases the nameless man from his care (Zimmermann and Zimmermann 2003, pp. 54â58): â[35]And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him [á¼ÏÎ¹Î¼ÎµÎ»Î®Î¸Î·ÏÎ¹ Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿¦. Curam illus habe]; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay theeâ (Luke 10, 35). What may have happened after that is not mentioned, but it is not important for these purposes. As I stated, the Samaritan does not want the continued suffering of the nameless man. I can form such a willâI now move away from the connection to the parableâbecause I want to address the concern of the person who has appealed to us: I place my will in the service of their concern. This will is the central element of the story. The will is then transformed. This will, which I bring forth in the course of my care, encounters me once againâseemingly foreign, seemingly having become independentâas a demand made to myself. This ought is by no means to be understood universally. With the help of this âorigin storyâ of the ought, I indeed intend to establish that"
137,124,0.973,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"The third profile reveals fathers who before taking leave were already regularly involved in housework and childcare. Rather than âhelpersâ, they see themselves as âsharersâ of housework and âinvolvedâ fathers. âHome aloneâ leave is therefore tied more closely to core issues of autonomy and innovation. The period of leave brings little in the way of the new learning of basic tasks (âI already knew how to do thatâ, âI didnât need a parachuteâ), but it is experienced as a final step towards becoming an independent caregiver to whom all tasks may be delegated as well as an opportunity to be creative, by building up an individualized profile of fathering. This may explain why the seven men in the innovation and independence profile experienced leave as a period of intense activity in which they engage in a large variety of tasks and become fully involved caregivers. As a couple we are quite egalitarian. It was total sharing with the baby (â¦), I didnât breastfeed thatâs all. During that month everything went well, I already knew how to do everything, even if I was slightly unsure to begin with. In fact, I would have liked to stay longer, because itâs a phase in the childâs development in which interaction makes a difference, it increases and becomes more gratifying every day. Being on leave alone also makes for more complicity with the child, so it gives both parents a chance to develop their special place. In my view, it doesnât take away anything from the mother but it adds to the fatherâs role (Raul, 37, TV journalist, 2 children)."

And that this is their main reason for choosing this profession. In the following example, youth coordinator â1â tells about his reasons for applying for the job: 1: â[The job is] very versatile. And I like working with the vulnerable â those who have the harshest conditions. It ended up that way when I taught in high school â that I was asked to work with those young people, who many of my colleagues thought were difï¬cult and challenging. But at the end of the day I thought that when you back track a little and see why they are like they are, then I had no problem saying âI think they deserve another chanceâ. There is something there. But many of my colleagues would not take on that job, because it was hard work, they were externalising, it was heavy. But I liked being in it and understanding why it is like it is. Why they are like they are. Then it is much easier to change the path forward â to help them on this path.â Hence, the focus of the youth coordinators isâin my experience from interviews and observationsâresource-based in both words and in action. I have not once experienced punishment of the offenders articulated as a rationale for their work. The common notion amongst them seems to be that a âchainâ of caring professional as well as private help is provided around the young offender with the youth plan as the guide.21 A chain that can be removed at the young personâs (or his/her guardianâs) will. That a less friendly alternative will then take over is something that they are aware of and live with, but not something they necessarily condone or think they can be held responsible for."

Realistic and unrealistic associations flowed free and forthright while the writer was sitting at the computer of course, not lying on the analystâs couch, even though Sigmund Freudâs study at Berggasse nineteen is only a stoneâs throw from here. But why should we curb our thoughts? Who could make us censor ourselves? There is no need to camouflage the paths our reflections take. Nobody is giving out grades, at least not in enlightened zones, they say. So why constrain ourselves? Why shouldnât the arts, why shouldnât artists, slip outside their time? After all, actors know all about slips, whether a banal lapsus linguae or a more dire, fatal mistake, like the bloody slip Penthesilea commits against Achilles, for which she finds only the words So it was a mistake, a kiss a bite The two should rhyme for one who truly loves With all her heart can easily mistake them [ ... ] By Artemis my tongue pronounced one word For sheer unbridled haste to say another1 Slips (of the tongue) are so common in the actorâs art â why rein in our imagination if we want to understand the autotelos of the actor? Why not continue as we started, raving about where the actor comes from and where he is going, asking all we can of this fabled creature of truth? Why not? Why not play with the truth? Why not say about the pathos of his knowledge, his nous pathetikos, that he âposses[es] his pathos knowingly, insofar as the pathos would be an apprehension of existence returning upon itself â?2 Could it be a site of remembrance, a reminder of what we, qua our existence, might have become?

Still, there is a lot to be said for public domain ownership including âopen sourceâ. It has to be the creatorâs decision of course, what level of ownership to respect. Mark Hardenâs Art Archive has a vast array of beautiful scans. For all intents and purposes, itâs a virtual storehouse of art treasures dating back to cave paintings. The siteâs philosophy is that people should feel free to lift five or six images for nonprofit purposes. Yet does not reality dictate that anyone can lift as many images as they please and put them to whatever use? Thereâs two realities. At the Battle of Trafalgar, or some such battle, Admiral Nelson declares, âFull speed ahead!â His assistant protests. âBut what about those ships?â Nelson, holding up a telescope to his blind eye, the eye everyone knows is blind, replies, âI see no ships.â Orâ¦âDo what I said.â When you say âreality dictates,â there are a lot of realitiesâ¦ So that is why I do not countenance most of todayâs so-called web standardsâ¦ We need something much better and it is my duty to try to make a different reality which can supplant that other reality. I mean, a few hours on the web and you can have a whole lot of gifs and jpegs. Now, those things are being posted with a lot of implicit assumptions which the courts will be settling later, and whether you can repost, etcetera, is entirely uncertainâ¦ By the way, all these museums that are trying to claim copyright on 2000 year old things that they happen to own, God knows whatâs going to happen with thatâ¦like copyrighting the human gene. Computer Lib decries âthe creeping evil of Professionalism.â âI see Professionalism as the spreading disease of the present-day worldâ¦â I guess my claim at this point on that subject would be that everybody is seeking greater legitimacy and better pay for what they do, whether welding chips together, typing, or passing on the supposed validity of art objects. Professionalism is the stance that âI am highly trained; therefore, my work should be very expensive.â In the case of what Talcott Parsons called professionalism, a highly technical definition, we have an association which governs entrance to the trade based on competence and training. So thereâs considerable similarity between the Plumbersâ Union and the American Sociological Association. The upside is charlatans are pushed out of the field. The downside is talented but unqualified people are pushed out and you donât have all the options you should. Nowhere is that professionalism elitist class more obviously breaking down than music.

Prime Minister told me that Kazakhstan wanted to diversify its oil-based economy and accelerate its business climate reforms. He also said that the government was determined to initiate the necessary changes but that his team might need some help to pull the right levers. It was a great opportunity for me to show that the reforms described in this book were not only applicable to a small country like Georgia, but to other, bigger countries like Kazakhstan as well. âSo what are you doing these days, Nika?â he asked. âAs it happens, I am writing a book about the reforms in Georgia.

Following my working rule of âaccepting every invitationâ (Avieli 2012b), I never refused an invitation to join in a jungle meat restaurant or jungle meat meal cooked at home, though I generally prefer to stay away from illegal activities, and despite my objection to wild life hunting. I also found it very hard to eat the flesh of animals whose death I witnessed. This turned out to be awkward: joining the table but avoiding the meat was not merely a refusal to âbreak breadâ, but also abuse of the trust bestowed upon me by my hosts. They allowed me to observe them breaking the law and transgress moral standards, but my refusal to eat the food and embody the transgression, as it were, meant that now I had potentially implicating information about my hosts, but since I did not partake in the actual eating, they did not have the same kind of implicating information about me. My hosts were therefore adamant that I eat or, at least, try the meat, and were visibly upset when I refused. This dynamic was also common in cases were hostesses and potential paid sex were involved. Engaging in paid sex is perhaps the least kept secret of Hoianese men. The subject would come up in many male-only conversations and meetings, usually as a joke or a comment. But if I wouldnât protest or otherwise signal reservation, the conversation would very quickly turn into straightforward discussion of the potential of the waitress or some other women as a sex partner. This would often develop into an ambiguous invitation to pursue sex. I was interested in the subject and the discourse surrounding it, so I usually âpassedâ the first stage, with jokes turning into serious conversations regarding sexual practices, qualities, choices, availability, and price. However, the fact that I took notes and my eventual refusal to engage in paid sex were often met with dismay and discomfort. If I would have avoided the subject or presented a critical/moralistic position to begin with, it would probably be ok. But engaging in a conversation and asking for details that only practitioners would know, and later refuse to take part in the activity itself, was not only surprising but also perceived negatively by people who did not know me well."

Do you have a path to your audience through any of the established distribution bottlenecks (music publishers, radio stations, concert venues, record labels)? Computer technology has put those criteria into the past. Anyone can now create music, notation or instrumental skills being no longer required due to many new digital interfaces to sound. Anyone can netcast, podcast, stream, or publish music online. The line between professional and amateur, to the extent that it survives at all, is too blurry to be useful. And the same goes for visual art, writing, photography, cinema, leaving perhaps only the most physicality-mired creative professions relatively proficiency class based. This lack of a professional Ã©lite that can be clearly differentiated from non-professional creative workers is part of why the economies of the various arts are in such chaos due to computer tech. Now the most stable economic value seems to reside more so in the tools used for creative work, marketed as intellectual property in themselves, instead of in what is made using them. But the design of tools for creative work is too often no longer being done by their users, and such tools often very much limit both creative conception and output. Too often they require a work to be highly preconceived in advance of even launching software to explore. Often they present a menu of templates for project types and standard formats within a medium, shunting their user into one a prefabricated standard form. And for Tedâs main medium, words, we are still locked into sequential text editors in which it would have been impossible to write Tedâs earlier books. Laziness? Lack of imagination? Conservatism? Fear? Or a market-based, profitbased, tool-building industry that knows its bread is buttered by lowest common denominator non-thinking? Or maybe we are simply expecting things to change more radically, faster than they can, because while technology can speed up and get cheaper very quickly, other changes require profound paradigm shifts in the assumptions of entire social cultures.

In one case, a volunteer who spent over a year in Uganda was constantly under pressure not only from her peers but also from the hospital superintendent (in this case, a British volunteer himself) to become involved in routine service delivery and be placed on local staff rotas.15 She battled on a daily basis to resist service-delivery roles for over a year. Sadly, when she returned to Uganda after some months in the UK she immediately found that the expectation had increased. Staff assumed, as she knew the place and had experience of working there, she could immediately substitute for local health workers. In her monthly report she identiï¬ed the âmain obstacles to achieving her objectivesâ as follows: Itâs just that I seem to be left to do things on my own now a lot. Frequently I am doing the ward round alone with or without the intern as the only other midwife on the ward is in the Waiting Home for half the morning. Because I have been here so long the midwives treat me as one of the rota staff, which is lovely as they accept me and trust me, but means I canât do admin and prep for teaching as they assume I am always going to be there to do the ward round. And as there is often literally no-one else to do it I canât really just disappear to do teaching prep etc. so my objectives changed â I think that is probably a natural progression in this type of work after one has been there for a while (V)."

The tone is humorous and the descriptions respectful, like in this account from the otherwise quite father-identified Geir: Very thorough and dust on the brain, cleaning herself to death.

The job is now just a necessary evil instead of my lifeâs calling.â In one important respect, menâs participation in paid employment did not change due to long leaves. All fathers who had completed leaves returned to full-time work and those still on leave planned to do so. An earlier study found that men who took at least 2 months of leave worked fewer hours, mainly through reducing earlier overtime (Duvander and Jans 2009). Despite working full-time afterward, several fathers mentioned making structural adjustments to help work become more compatible with family life. Some changes were major. Mats (group leader, 40) gave up a managerial position he was promoted to before his leave, upon realizing how much time the position took. âI remember when I made that decision, I told them no, I intend to concentrate on my children, and it was so heavenly nice when it was said, when they understood that I was seriousâ¦.â Other job changes were less dramatic, but designed to increase menâs flexibility to participate in childcare. Matthias (telecommunications advisor, 33) reported: âI think like this, âIf I travel to that meeting, how will it work out at home?â You have to think like that when you become a parent, you have a responsibilityâ¦.â Nils (researcher, 40) stated: âI work from home one day a week to be able to pick up and drop off [at preschool] that day.â Carlos (technical production manager, 42) leaves work early to pick up his child from preschool, âIt doesnât matter if I am sitting in a meeting with a super-important person, no, sorry.â Fathers also reported that they experienced negative consequences of leavetaking on their careers. While on leave, Carlosâs boss hired another person as technical manager, a position he thought would be his. Robert said he lost clients when on leave and had to build his base back up again. Noel (creative director, 37) said the kind of company he works at changes quickly ââ¦. I canât be half-time and at the same time be the creative directorâ¦such a person must be present. If you want to have a career perhaps you shouldnât follow my exampleâ (laughs). For some, their changed attitudes meant that career damage did not matter. Nils said: ââ¦if I hadnât had children and had I only prioritized my career â¦I perhaps would have gotten somewhere elseâ¦.. Who knows, I feel very good about this, I feel that I grew as a person because I took [leave].â Another theme from the interviews was that fathers felt that there were positive consequences of their leave-taking for their workplaces. Some claimed leave had made them more efficient when back at work. A few mentioned that leave-taking increased company recruitment. Patrik (production manager, 32) stated: âIt became an opportunity to circulate people and recruit new ones.â A few discussed how being on leave affected their management style, enhancing other menâs opportunities to be at home. Filip (district store manager, 32) reported: âI emphasize [to my employees]â¦ âStay home, we will manage, we will survive. We wonât go under just because you are at home, this will be super important for you.ââ"

Some participants explain that they still use quite old devices, such as 12- or even 20-year-old computers. Others have only one device of each type, as 58-year-old Manuel Maier, who is currently unemployed, explains. He could not listen to the radio for three weeks as his only radio was broken and he had to wait until the Repair CafÃ© to fix it. Some participants also explain that they buy or acquire used media technologies from people who have bought new devices. Several participants âresistâ technological innovation, for example by not having a smartphone but still using âoldâ mobile phones. Others abstain from technologies, with some participants saying they do not own a television or mobile phone, for example. But many volunteers own complex media repertoires, an example being 30-year-old Jan Schmitz, a trained IT technician, who helps to repair smartphones, explains: âI like technology a lot. I donât need a new mobile phone every year but I want to see whatâs new and what makes sense. [â¦] I test [devices] [â¦], either I like it, or if I donât, I sell it again.â To sum up, not only do the aims of people participating in Repair CafÃ©s differ (even though the consumer-critical aims were dominant) but also they have a range of media technologies. What unites all of them is the wish to repair their media technologies."

However, the most frequent reason for postponing having children is the fear of what they, consistent with modern feminist lingua, name âthe gender trapâ, referring to experiences as well as research that indicate that gender equality in the family only lasts until the arrival of children (Kjeldstad and LappegÃ¥rd 2009; KitterÃ¸d and RÃ¸nsen 2012). They discuss it with their partners, many of whom think it is time for children; they set terms and conditions, but still feel troubled by the prospect of losing freedom and control of their lives. Pia, who at 18 was one of the few who said that she would like to marry a stay-at-home dad, is now very aware of how income inequality plays its part in reproducing a traditional gender division in the family: Iâm very happy that he and I earn the same amount, oh god! Iâm happy about that! And I donât want him to race ahead of me in salary. And had I known ten years ago what I know today, I might have thought more about money than I did when I chose my education. (Pia, 30)"
117,319,0.972,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Nurses expressed that continually trying to achieve their care goals is their wish as a healthcare professional, and a few nurses believed that âconstant dripping wears the stoneâ (I-NN-06). Unfortunately, patientsâ lack of intention to follow up on the principles of diabetes management restrains nurses from going further during the care process. In the following case, a nurse tried to motivate her patients at the beginning, but after some failed attempts, the nurse eventually accepted her patientâs decision even though this decision was against her will. However, this outcome led to an uncomfortable feeling on the part of the nurse and hurt the patientâ nurse relationship as well: The patient was exasperated one day and told me, âStop now, I donât want to hear about it [diabetes care] any moreâ. Then I said, âOkay, letâs let it goâ. Then I said nothing about it any more. I had argued with him because of his diabetes. But he still eats chocolate, doesnât change his life. Then he has to inject more and more Insulin and is getting fatter. He wants that. One day you have to say, âOkayâ and accept it. Although it is a difficult decision, but what should I do? I cannot beat him and push him on the way, right. (I-NN-06)"
163,50,0.972,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"conclUSion The gift carries with it three obligations: to give, to receive and to give again. And this is also what taxes make us do if they should sustain. In our contemporary societies, there is an endless giving and receiving going on with state and with societyâevery day and in manifold different ways. Against this background it is interesting to explore taxation in terms of reciprocity. We saw in research about taxation that four different types of reciprocal relation could be identified. First, reciprocity that expects something very explicit in return for taxes paid; a tit-for-tat relation. I expect something in return for having given/paid my tribute to the state although, as Mauss stated, obviously time lags between giving and receiving something in return. Second, it implies a relationship with others in the sense of wanting to behave in a similar way. Reciprocity here is a copy-cat relationship. Such a reciprocity can be invoked by any human behaviour: it is learning by doing what others do and making sure we do the same thing. This way of seeing reciprocity is closely related to situations where we all pay a fair shareâthe third typeâwhen taxpayers comply because they expect that others will pay their fair share. If we all put what we owe into the same treasure chest, we have all paid. Implicit here is our trust that taxes collected will be distributed evenly. Finally, reciprocity also regards being treated uniformlyâit is a question of equality. Here scrutiny is directed towards the power of the law and the interpretation of the law through"

And there is a paper on âThe very idea of an outcomeâ; the notes connected to that paper, I think, brought Tomasz Placek into BST. NB: Thatâs right. TM: Then here is work in â97 building up to the deontic part of Facing the future. Did you have the idea of wrapping that all up in a book by then? It must have been at around that time. NB: It must have been. Mickey and I had the idea fairly early, that we were writing chapters of a book. TM: And you were getting them out as articles. There is another dstit paper with Jeff Horty; he had his book out in the same year as Facing the future. And there is this very nice paper on âConcrete transitionsâ in â98, digging out this notion of a transition in von Wright, which is not easy to find in his work, I think. Did he react to the paper? NB: I donât think so. I read it at his conference, yes. But I donât recall that he had anything to say about it. TM: In his work, transitions are really buried in the idea of âand nextâ, which is much less subtle then what you make of it. âTruth by ascentââ, from 1999, I think I havenât read that. Whatâs in there? NB: Intimations of the revision theory. TM: And then this is a piece that I guess will be very hard to find, âModest notions of free will and indeterminismâ, in the Proceedings of the Creighton Club, 1999âbut itâs one of the few pieces in which you say something about the role indeterminism can play for us. NB: It comes out in some other papers. TM: Yes, it does. Then 2000 has the invited paper to the Advances in Modal Logic conference in Leipzig. This is your piece on âDouble time references: Understanding speech-act modalities in an indeterministic settingâ. So this is, as it were, maybe the next step in the (anti-)Thin red line project. And then in 2001 we have the book, Facing the future, together with Mickey Perloff and Ming Xu. You did the typesetting for that all by yourself? NB: Yes. TM: I think most of the following items I know pretty well. With an intermission of a couple of years, there is the next paper on applying the branching space-times ideas and working out one of the central notions in the BST-framework, namely the idea of modal correlations, or as you call it, âfunny businessâ. And thatâs when we met, at the Workshop on non-locality and modality in KrakÃ³w in 2001 that Tomasz Placek organized with Jeremy Butterfield. Can you say something about the period in between, from 1992 when BST appeared, until that paper? What made you pick up this idea again? It seems like in the late â90s most of your work is really on what becomes Facing the future, and BST is not part of that. But itâs of course clear in a"
50,79,0.972,"Seeing Ourselves Through Technology : How We Use Selfies, Blogs and Wearable Devices To See and Shape Ourselves","Diaries are always, in a sense, written in real time. As engaged readers or followers of online self-representations, we always crave the next post, the next image, the next bit of the story. The very act of starting a blog or an Instagram or Facebook account carries with it an intention to write or share more, again, another day. As Phillippe Lejeune writes of diaries, âAll journal writing assumes the intention to write at least one more time, an entry that will call for yet another one, and so on without end. ... To âfinishâ a diary means to cut it off from the futureâ (2001, 100â1). Social media embed this âcall for yet another oneâ into the software. Facebook asks âWhatâs on your mind?â, Twitter offers me retweet buttons and a box to write my tweets in, and HeyDay and OptimizeMe push notifications to the home screen of my phone, suggesting I might want to look at my photos or update the log of my activities today. The ultimate real-time diary is a diary that writes itself automatically, without needing your input. Smartphones are ideal devices for logging our day-to-day experiences. For a start, they automatically store information about what we are doing: a phone can log our geographic location and thus where we go and how fast we are moving from place to place, and many models can also track motions, meaning it can estimate whether we are running, climbing or dancing. Some phones sense far more than this. The âSensors Overviewâ on Android.comâs pages for developers explains how to use data from platforms that have sensors for temperature, light, pressure, humidity, gravity and more. The phone not only knows whether we make phone calls or send texts or emails, but also knows which apps we use and what we search for online. It knows what version of the operating system we are using, what music we play, what videos we watch and what we read. It can measure how fast we read and the style of our writing. In the final chapter of this book, I discuss the implications of our devicesâ automatic tracking for privacy and surveillance, but in this chapter I explore how we are beginning to use this automatic tracking to document and explore our own lives. We are currently seeing more and more examples of continuous, automated, real-time diaries, where our everyday use of technology is converted into a journal-like format. Location sharing was one of the first aspects of personal data to be automatically logged at the userâs request, first with services such as Plazes.com, which logged you as being at a new location every time it saw that your laptop was connected from a different IP number (J.W. Rettberg 2014, 86), and later with smartphone apps such as Foursquare and Swarm that use the phoneâs built in GPS and DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0006"
137,113,0.972,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"The learning process is also a fundamental aspect of the experience mentioned by all the fathers. Having been on paternity leave for 2â4 weeks, all the interviewees had acquired at least some basic skills, such as changing nappies, by the time they stayed alone. Most fathers therefore describe the acquisition of skills as a process which goes beyond the role of a care âhelperâ. This includes learning how to be an âindependentâ or self-sufficient carer by taking on responsibility alone, learning the ins and outs of emotional care rather than just instrumental care such as changing nappies and feeding, and âtesting oneselfâ as a solo carer. Thatâs when we truly become parents, isnât it? When we have such a close tie to them that we know just by the kind of crying, or by his manner, what he wants â¦ that kind of awareness is very important, I think it shows how close you are, and thatâs what it really means to be a father. (Rafael, 28, management consultant, 1 child) To all effects this was my first complete experience of being a fatherâ¦ during that time you understand thatâ¦ there you have the real proof that your life has changed, right? And that everything will be different, your priorities change completely, your priorities, your timetable, everything. So I, during that month, I had the concrete proof that the most important thingâ¦ was that baby, it was Pedro, and also the idea of the responsibility that this implies is something which, I think, really changes you as a person, especially someone who has decided to use the shared parental leave, it was a big experience (Ricardo, 43, economist, 1 child)"

An elderly woman from another communal council was also asked to speak. She was fumbling at first, but once she got started, she delivered a quite passionate speech, demanding to know the name of the company involved in the project and where it was: âAha, the CDI was started, what was done, where is the money, it is necessary to look for them, to investigate, who are these people who were given money to do this work and then left it?â she said, visibly upset.

309,262,0.972,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"Concomitantly, the choice of products in such contexts was often very selective, limited predominantly to vegetables and fruits for the children. Going the extra length financially and by adding to the regular shopping routine in order to provide the familyâs children with the perceived safest food not only indicates the weight that is put onto the childrenâs health. It also hints at a form of responsibilisation in which it is the task of the individual to protect the health of those unable to exercise choice by themselves, namely children. The role of responsibility for the familyâs health as a pivotal moment was not limited to the interviewed shoppers but also voiced by the organic entrepreneurs. Minh, founder of the organic delivery service started farming based on organic principles on family land in order to provide himself, his family and friends with healthy food: âBecause I care [for] my health and [for] my familyâs health. And I think some of my friends they need my productsâ (Interview, 10/2015), a decision that later evolved into a business. Organic entrepreneur Hoa explicitly described expecting a baby as the pivotal moment that drew her attention to the health aspects of eating: So before 2013 I was not concerned about what I eat, I donât care, I donât know about organic. But when I was pregnant in the first 3 months I was sick, sickness of pregnancy, so I did not eat anything except raw vegetables. So whenever my mom or my husband bought vegetables from outside to bring home we always need many things to clean it. Take time to clean it and people still worry about vegetable chemical effects [being] not good to my baby and my health. So I spent time on the internet to find out, to discover about safe food and organic. So I thought that organic is the highest safety standard in the world. (Interview, 01/2016)"

From a Lacanian-Bachtinian perspective, it is clear that the âweâ functions as a grammatical operationalisation of S2: the replaceable, un-subjective, decidedly impersonal subject of science. But it also covers up the exploitation and expropriation of the servant by the Master (âWe, the Master, did thisâ). And Leahâs therapeutic intervention proves effective, for from now on, Stafford begins to pay attention to Cantorâs use of the term âweâ (or âourâ), which suddenly may give way to âIâ or âmineâ. For instance, he now notices that Cantor informs him that the Krauss team is having troubles repeating âyourâ experiment, and that there may be something the matter with âyourâ notebooks, while he consistently speaks about âourâ Nature article. In the latter case, there is âno ambiguity about ourâ (p. 89). In other words, Cantor uses the âweâ in such a way that he may safeguard his intellectual property rights, while attributing any experimental flaws to his assistant. From now on, Stafford begins to pay attention to (and even count) Cantorâs uses of the signifier âweâ (p. 83). Indeed, the use of the signifier âweâ proves highly symptomatic and, from the point of view of critical discourse analysis, a fascinating object of research. In response to Leahâs intervention, Celestineâs supervisor makes a telling confession. At a certain point in her career, she decided to change her name from Yardley to Ardley, in view of the importance of alphabetic order in the listing of author names: Let me confess something to you â¦ but promise not to spread it around â¦ When I was a senior at Brown [University] â and a very ambitious one, almost unpleasantly so â I paid very much attention to where my name would ultimately appearâ¦ To my fatherâs shock, I announced one day that I would change my name from Jean Yardly to Jean Ardleyâ¦ Yes. I went to the courthouse and did it legally. Itâs best to be first, itâs been true since prehistoric times (p. 51)."

As so often before, the answer lies in the word itself, for the English term inter-esting stems from the Latin inter esse, literally in-between-being.

They started crying and I asked them âWhy do you blame me? Why only me? If itâs about putting on blame, then it should be fair and include mom and dad, but why only me? Why donât you have a go at your father?â âBecause he is not here and the only one here is youâ they say. Well, if the only one here is me, then you should understand me because all the responsibility of dad is mine. I have the full responsibility, and if I work, I donât work for me, itâs for you and I am so very tiredâ¦ Why are you so unfair with me? Complain when I donât fulfil my duties, then complainâ. Linked to this, in the absence of the head of the household, children frequently assume parental responsibilities. Boys take on roles of authority (especially older boys) and girls assume caring duties regardless of their age. JosÃ© exercises his fatherhood through the phone. He calls three times per week, sometimes every day. Cristina says that unlike many other migrants in Tilcajete JosÃ© is an exemplary father. âHe has always looked after his children. He sends them so many things and gifts, I even tell him to stop spoiling them ... I have no complaints with him as a fatherâ. Technology has been fundamental in enabling closer relations between migrants and their families in the community of origin, though unfortunately not all households have access to a telephone as there are only a limited number of phone lines available and these date only from the year 2005. Mobile phones are more common although they are much more expensive and have very bad reception in the valley. Since 2008 computers have become an increasingly valued asset and investment, linked with migrants and with the importance of education. Nevertheless, internet access is also limited and of very poor quality. There is also a generational gap in terms of technology use. Youngsters are much better prepared to use technology. Thus, phones (in homes, with relatives, or at local phone booths) remain the preferred option. Videos and photographs are also crucial. When children do not know their fathers, they become acquainted with them through photographs, videos, and phone calls. Money is a central topic in families with migrants and it is usually one of the main reasons causing emigration, although it is not the only one. Many newlyweds resort to migration in order to seek economic"

334,258,0.971,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Following Rosenberger and Winklerâs (2014) terminology, the beneficiary can be described as the object of solidarity protest. This designation underlines their rather passive role in the protest, compared to the civil society actors qualified as protest subjects. Even if the beneficiary does not take part in the protest activities in the same way as the civil society actors, we argue that their role cannot be described as passive. Our results show that the beneficiary of the protest is equally its protagonist. Representing the case defended by the protesters, the beneficiary has to face the media, break the silence and accept to reveal his identity. The particularity of casespecific protests is indeed that the beneficiary does not remain anonymous. They leave the shadow in which other undocumented migrants remain, afraid of what might be seen as a strategy with an uncertain outcome (Antony 2010, 15). As described by one beneficiary we interviewed, beginning a public protest requires courage: That demands a lot of work, and then it requires a lot of organization. Not everyone can do it. At the start we were about ten people in Geneva in the same situation. [â¦] I called them all ten, and said: âWhat shall we do now?

I have done an investigation and analysis of automobile catalogues using data from around 1995. What I found was that for automobiles of the same weight, the average fuel economy values for Japanese cars were about 15% better than those from the US and European manufacturers. However, if we look at data from 2015, we now see that there is practically no difference when it comes to standard gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles. Uchiyamada I talked about it earlier, but one of the biggest drivers for hybrid vehicles was that the worldâs manufacturers got wrapped up in a competition over fuel economy. Due to this, governments also decided there were still more regulations they could set and those regulations got tighter. Itâs tough for us, too, but given that these regulations apply to all manufacturers your only choice is to do what you can to come out on top under those conditions. Komiyama Right. If everyone really joins in, and in particular if China and the United States join in, then the tighter the regulations the more Japan has an edge. Uchiyamada There certainly are some who say itâs better to make them as strict as possible, but when you do so the burdens on the customer rise dramatically. You need time in order to not push the cost up. The best time for developing and introducing the new engines and platforms that make the biggest improvements to fuel economy is when you do a model change. Accordingly, even people say letâs improve it by 20% starting next year you canât do it out of the blue. Mid-to-long-term targets like those of the Paris Agreement talked about at COP 21 are important. Komiyama Are various efforts already underway with 2050 in mind? Uchiyamada Things have already started. I canât offer you any specifics as of yet, but letâs take furnaces as an example. Currently, we fuel them with natural gas, but weâre wondering about whether or not we can use hydrogen, which doesnât produce CO2 when burned. Nobody thought about this at Toyota before we came up with the challenges. Itâs that sort of a new idea. We havenât built a plant in the past 3 years, but in the future, we will begin construction for the next stage of development.

They take pride in the fact that they have been married to their wives for more than half a century.

But, and then you had to get yourself together because you started to get old, you know, and there was nothing to move out for. Q: What did you think about then? Oh, I had a lot of strange thoughts.

223,183,0.971,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"As aptly as these introductory words by SchÃ¼tz and Simmel summarize my own hypothesis on the presumed phenomenon of non-knowledge,1 I note that it is captured still more precisely by economist Joseph Stiglitzâs (2005) formulation about the âinvisible handâ (p. 133) ostensibly operating in the market place. Asked why the invisible hand is invisible, Stiglitz gave a straightforward answer: because it does not exist. Similarly, I ask in this chapter why non-knowledge is difficult to grasp. And my equally analogous response is: because there is no such thing as non-knowledge. Not wishing to capitulate already at this early point, I concentrate in this chapter on scientific discourses in which participants maintain that something like nonknowledge does exist. The knowledge/non-knowledge dichotomy appears in many discussions on the subject as a kind of performative speech act (Sartori, 1968). However, it recommends only one side of that which it designates, namely, knowledge. I cannot quite sustain my doubt about the existence of not-knowing; from time to time I have to deviate from it and maintain that non-knowledge does exist. At the same time, I draw attention to other terms that are empirically and theoretically more productive than the naked assertion that non-knowledge exists. Finally, I will point to a number of intriguing, but rarely studied topics relating to the question of the societal function or societal treatment of apparently insufficient knowledge. My usage of the term non-knowledge follows the convention in the literature that discusses the absence of knowledge. The term is synonymous with not knowing and has a close affinity but not identity with ignorance. In German the term is Nichtwissen."

This certainly refers to a certain degree of ambivalence in their relationship; the mixed-method approach allowed us to note that both partners are ambivalent while a single method would have led us to conclude that one partner only is high on emotion and thus âresponsibleâ for the negativity in the relation. Moreover, we would not have identified the same partner as the ânegative oneâ depending on the chosen method. The mixed method also allows a more complex and comprehensive evaluation of a situation. In fact, each method measures a different aspect of this situation and grasps its nuances and subtleties."

299,25,0.971,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"questions of values and public policy somehow corrupts their academic purity and virtue. Moreover, like others, I found that applied work enlivened the basic one. Thus, when I tried to sort out when privacy should yield to the common good, for instance, to protect public health, I found it helped me think through more generally how one is to deal with clashes between two core values (Etzioni 1999). Most of what follows is applied. To some, the term âethicsâ evokes values such as veracity, loyalty, and truthfulness. However, the ethics domain is much vaster. It concerns itself with individual rights, social justice, peace, and much else. Cases in kind follow. They all deal with current challenges both in societies and on the global level. Part I asks how we can determine what a good life is. Many measure it by how happy people are. Happiness in turn is assumed to be derived from high income that enables one to lead an affluent way of life, mainly viewed as being able to consume a lot of goods and services. However, evidence shows that by and large (there are always exceptions when one deals with social science data), once income rises above the level at which peopleâs basic needs can be met, it adds little to their happiness. Other social scientists studied whether what one does gives meaning to life. However, meaning can be gained by joining a gang or ISIS. At least from an ethicistâs viewpoint and, as I see it, from most peopleâs personal viewpoint, something is missing, something rather profound, namely, the sense of doing good. It is a sense that leads people to make sacrifices not for self-glorification, not to feel good about themselves, but to service others. I am not writing about saints, but about parents who take care of a severely disabled child, about spouses who take care of their partners with cancer or Alzheimerâs, and about volunteers who go into places that are unsafe to help those in danger (see Chap. 1). The three Abrahamic religions have a clear perception of what human nature is; I call it one of a moral wrestler. Although they differ on the weight they accordâand the ways they depictâthe forces that make us stray, they share the basic understanding of human nature. For Catholicism, the original sin plays a greater role than the yetzer hara (bad instinct) in Judaism; and neither embraces the Protestant notion of predestination. Islam emphasizes humansâ inherent goodness (fitrah), which must be upheld against base desires and sinful outside influences. However, all see life as a struggle between doing good and being tempted to violate our sense of what is right; all see room for some form of punishment as well as redemption. Social science by and large, with notable exceptions, has moved away from this view of human nature. This is not true merely for economics but, we shall see, also for psychology, sociology, and anthropology. If we could do more to incorporate the concept of the moral wrestlers into the social sciences, we might be able to learn more about what makes for better human beings and better societies (see Chap. 2). Part II is dedicated to an examination of human nature. Are we out to maximize ourselves and does society work well when each person focuses on what they consider good? On a basic level, this issue has been debated as the difference between homo economicus and homo sapiens. Those who adhere to the rationalistic paradigm, the one that treats people as homo economicus, assume that humans have"

299,468,0.97,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Our ambitions are high. We have a long list of desiderata that in effect entail reengineering much of the physical and social world around us, even the self. We Americans are keen to prevent the alarming deterioration of the environment, to attain higher rates of economic growth, to reduce inequality, to curtail the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent offenses while simultaneously reducing drug abuse, to end war and genocide, to foster human rights, to reform campaign finance, and to improve our knowledge, skills, and self-awareness (most recently through âmindfulnessâ). When then-President Bill Clinton was asked, on the eve of a new year, what he wished for his fellow Americans in the year to come, he responded: âHave all your dreams come true.â Sadly, a deep gap exists between our aspirations and our capabilities. We aspire to re-engineer much the world, but actually we are often buffeted by forces we neither understand nor control. Revisit the list of desiderata introduced above; it soon becomes clear that we have made little progress on most of these fronts, and we actually have fallen back on quite a few of them. All too often, we do not even agree about how to tackle these issues, nor do we command the know-how, resources, political will, or personal dedication to proceed successfully. After conducting a review of the history of how we acquired these ambitions, and the role of science and technology in fostering them, I asked where we go from here. It seems obvious that either we must greatly scale back our ambitions, or we must double down and find more effective ways to proceed. Actually, it is likely that we will have to do both. Science and technology are seen by some as the most promising sources for finding ways to catch up, for controlling history rather than being subject to its vicissitudes. Others see science and technology as exacerbating the problem. Here, too, there might be a third way."

Really cosy here! There is nothing negative about this room (Girl, 13â15 years). Another typical answer related to the fact that children could do things in the waiting roomâthey did not have to sit passively and wait: â There was a lot of toys here and that was nice. Itâs lots of things to do (Girl, 10â12 years). â I like the waiting room because there are lots of fun things to do here, for instance play Wii, or relax (Boy, 10â12 years). â You can do a lot here. I wish my room was like this! (Girl, 10â12 years). A third quality that the children appreciated was the ability to relax in the waiting area. â It is nice here, and there are no kids here so it is nice because it is mostly quiet. And I have relaxed and it was good so I really had a good time in the waiting room (Girl, 10â12 years). â I liked the waiting room because of the [massage] chair. It was really good to sit in it while I relaxed and some of the people who work here talked to my mum so I sat in the chair (Girl, 10â12 years). Referring to Rasmussenâs (2008) study, ÃstrÃ¶m and Rejmer (2008) argue that childrenâs responses in interviews suggest that they appreciate and notice the colours, toys and furnishing at the Barnahus. From the perspective of the children who participated in the survey on Norwegian Barnahus, child-friendliness is also connected to the activities that the waiting area invites and the choice between relaxation and play or entertainment. These possibilities are important in both the concrete and symbolic sense; they offer children a sense of agency and they can choose the level of activity that suits them in the situation."

However, my perception was a bit wrong, as I learned more about the psychological background than anything else. Fortunately, psychology does interest me, mostly as to how people think and their perception of products and their surroundings. In my opinion, however, the learning line is a bit too much. After one course of 5 ECTS, I had learned enough about psychology, with the two other courses of Human in Technology merely acting as repetitions of the ï¬rst course. My interest faded because of these repetitions and my motivation began to decrease. The project, on the other hand, was a lot of fun. We used the information we learned in a practical sense.

That is to say, responding to the problems related to the environment and energy, and the aging society is certainly necessary for humanity in the twenty-first century. It seems to me that, as opposed to having a single industry solve a given problem, such as the aging society, for example, that the entire system will need to be revamped. It seems that everything, like buildings, transportation, and distribution â almost everything as we know it â will change. Konishi Yes, the industrial structure changing to that of the Platinum Society. Yoshikawa The technology developed in each specialized field has to be bundled together and integrated horizontally, so that what are essential should be produced at the end. Komiyama I believe that we are entering an era where that will be possible. If we can appropriately combine technologies and knowledge we already have, it can be done. Thatâs why the horizontal axis becomes important. Yoshikawa For example, the vehicles used in the emergency medical field will probably become smart cars, but that means that the departments that become the destination points for those emergency vehicles will also have to incorporate new technology and change. This is where it becomes necessary that there be a coordinator for facilitating the horizontal integration. Komiyama If an attempt were made to configure the emergency medical system by new technology such as drones, GPSs, smart cars, etc., it would run up against the vertical hierarchy of the government bureaucracy. So, I believe that this is the type of problem that needs to be solved by the government."

However, a surprise came at the end, when the expert was asked for the total magnitude of white-collar crime. The expert responded that to keep consistent with previous answers, the answer would be 3 billion NOK. From a methodological point of view this is fine, as there is no reason to argue that respondents should be able to keep track of previous estimates to keep consistency during the interview. As illustrated by the two bank executives who first refused to participate, and then changed their minds as they were contacted by someone they knew on the project team, recruitment of experts can be influenced by previous relationships. The one researcher on the project team who they knew, is also quite well-known in Norway, because he frequently comments on white-collar crime cases in the media. This phenomenon caused even more experts to change their minds or to contribute the name of an alternative expert. For example, one bankruptcy attorney responded: Nice to hear from you, and I hope we can have a chat over a coffee or lunch about your stay in the United States. I currently receive inquiries from both home and abroad to participate in various surveys and the like, and I have therefore set a limit to what I can participate in.

275,56,0.97,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In the pictured example, P(1) = 2/3 would be a reasonable prediction since in two thirds of the cases where the context 0011 occurred before it was followed by a 1. (Laplaceâs rule gives a slightly different estimate.) Humans often make predictions this way. For example, when predicting whether I will like the food at a Vietnamese restaurant, I use my experience from previous visits to Vietnamese restaurants. One question that arises when doing induction with contexts is how long or specific the context should be. Should I use the experience from all Vietnamese restaurants I have ever been to, or only this particular Vietnamese restaurant? Using the latter, I may have very limited data (especially if I have never been to the restaurant before!) On the other hand, using too unspecific contexts is not useful either: Basing my prediction on all restaurants I have ever been to (and not only the Vietnamese), will probably be too unspecific. Table 2.2 summarises the tradeoff between short and long contexts, which is nicely solved by the CTW algorithm. The right choice of context length depends on a few different parameters. First, it depends on how much data is available. In the beginning of an agentâs lifetime, the history will be short, and mainly shorter contexts will have a chance to produce an adequate amount of data for prediction. Later in the agentâs life, the context can often be more specific, due to the greater amount of accumulated experience."

Instead, the search for trillions of dollars for good returns on investment causes frequent bubbles and economic instability. Sounds absurd? That is what I thought until I read good old Karl Marx. He explains how, in the context of the ascent of the mainstream economic paradigm, money has been given a peculiar functionâa function that Polanyi acknowledged when he called it a ï¬ctitious commodity, but that economics textbooks overlook.

Before the war everyone spoke like this [us].â She added that one did not even know who belonged to which nationality, especially if the name did not tell; and most people did not care, as if they were one big nation. Minela includes herself in the group of people who saw everyone as the same. As if to underline this fact, she said her two best friends before the war were Croat and Serb. This claim for the sameness of the people in Yugoslavia, however, seems to oppose her view of the Bosniak nation as distinct from the Serb and Croat nation. When referring to pre-wartime, Minela stresses the sameness of people in BiH and claims that distinctions are artificially created. At other times, however, she follows a discourse that strongly essentialises the Bosniak and Croat identity, thereby emphasising peopleâs differences over their commonalities. This discourse of essentialising identities became most clear when Minela spoke about mixed marriages, especially about children from such marriages. She abruptly stopped arguing that all Bosnians were Bosnians first and foremost but focused instead on their national differences: Before the warâ¦ we were indeed ashamed to say that we were Muslims. Somehow we felt like this. Listen, at the time of Bajram, the last Bajram before the war began, I think it was February, I and a friend of mine were waiting in the hallway for a lecture to begin when someone came in and said, âBajram Mubarek Olsunâ [Bajram greeting]. We looked like this [she looks with her eyes wide open] because nobody ever said that aloud. Like they were some Hare Krishna or something like that. And so we stayed there and just looked at her like, âWhy do you say that aloud?â as if she was not allowed to say that. It was because of communism. You know, like there is no religion, there is no religion, nothing like that exists, you know? As if it was wrong, you know? That is why we [Bosniaks] often got married to Serbs and Croats and then you lose, you totally lose your identity. You give up your faith for your family; this is why these marriages were not good. You get married and you lose your faith and then you have nothing. Then you just celebrate Christmas and thatâs it.

Through these actions, he expresses his identity to the public. The reason why he attracts our attention here is that his identity was not exclusively determined by nationality. He was a model for The No-No Boys, by Teresa Funke (2008). Although this book is a fictional work, it deals with the actual issue of Japanese Americansâ struggle for their identity. He chose to become one of the âNo-No Boys,â who demonstrated no loyalty to America and refused to serve in the US armed forces.4 This choice caused him to be sent to the Tule Lake Camp, which was famous, or infamous, for having the severest surveillance in the US. The Tule Lake camp was a specific facility for those who did not demonstrate their loyalty to America, and for those who were subject to investigation by the FBI. It is said that approximately 18,000 prisoners were held in the Tule Lake Camp, under constant armed surveillance. Interviewee A talks about the compulsory confinement of Japanese immigrants and their conscription as follows (â[ ]â signifies information added by the researcher): In America, many people call where I used to be held a ârelocation camp,â rather than a âconcentration camp.â However, based on our understanding, we call it not a relocation camp, but a âjailâ or a âconcentration camp.â We were deprived of our homes, land, stores, jobs, and everything. Nevertheless, it is called a ârelocation camp.â We feel upset about it. It was a concentration camp without any doubt. Not serving in the military, we had no national identity. We did not know who we were or where we could go. And what was waiting for us, those who did not serve in the military, was detention by the FBI, or repatriation to Japan, or life-long imprisonment at Tule Lake. Meanwhile, I was grateful that I was able to work in the camp as a time-keeper, a cook, a cleaner, and so on. Although the payment was low, it was still good to have a job. Also, I was able to go to school and play sports. That was something to be grateful for, but people around me and I thought that we would be killed if Japan won the war. That kind of anxiety was always with us in the life at the camp. Of course, there was no way of knowing about the progress of the war. We lived our lives at the camp without knowing what was going on. As for the 442nd Team, I, from the perspective of [being a member of] the No-No Boys, have a complicated feeling. Not all the team members who did a good job in the European battlefields demonstrated their loyalty to America. There has always been a political use [of the history of Japanese immigrants]."

One thing led to another and one of the instructors had started a shop of his own. He was really charismatic, but damn blunt. He was a towering bloke, at least two metres tall and weighed at least 140 kg, you know, the kind of person who takes over any room he walks into. No one dared to question anything [he said or did]. So he took us out on svart jobs. He took the best guys, you know I was a concrete man and used to work with these things. There were also bus drivers and shipyard men, but they didnât know a thing. So he asked me if I wanted to come along. I donât remember what I got paid. But first I got travel compensation from the dole fund. Then I got paid by him, svart of course. It was great, super. But there is more. We were there during this course, and when it ended I got a job with his firm. Thatâs how he managed and made it grow. Just went in and took the guys he wanted. The other instructors had no say, maybe they got a piece as well, what do I know? Everybody who worked in his firm had been at AMU, by the way. He ran a great business, with good guys and we had fun together. Actually, it was a really good time. So we continued working for AMU and did all the jobs there. There was a lot of immigration and other stuff going on, lots of construction at this enormous centre they had in Gothenburg. So we went around, built offices, refurbished and even tore down things we had constructed ourselves. There was nil planning and too much money. We were even at the home of the boss of the entire AMU Gothenburg and installed a bloody big oak door in his garage. He did not pay five krona for it, of that Iâm certain. We built a carport for another boss, AMU paid for the materials and we were paid on the side as you say [svart]. We did so many reconstructions and there was so much money, and as I was already then a bit interested in how society works, I thought it was damn disgusting. Even if I was being paid, it irritated me that government money went on this! They spent so much money that finally there was a directive from above that no invoices could exceed 25,000 for refurbishment. This just resulted in a hell of a lot of 25,000 krona invoices. How bloody stupid can you be?"

There were two further insights that told me this was the right problem to solve. First, during an interview with a Red Cross ambulance driver, she told me that she was so lost trying to find someoneâs house that when she arrived it was too late, and the person was already dead. This made me realize that the problem of physical addressing was so much bigger than just the logistics and supply chain industry. The second insight was from a United Nation (UN) spokesman, who said there were four billion people in the world without a physical address today and that this number would double to eight billion by 2050. That was when I realized quite how big this problem is for the world and that finding the right solution for it would be a mission that I wanted to dedicate the next decade or more of my life to. The last step was to turn the problem into a single mission statement that inspired not only the team but also anyone who touched OkHi, from friends to journalists, family members to prospective employees. It actually took us 18 months to come up with our current statement. At our first offsite retreat, we spent time trying to answer why OkHi needs to exist and why it is so important to solve the physical addressing problem. We settled on an initial statement that was to âphysically connect the world with a global address system.â Over time, though, it became clear that the statement was not inspiring enough, or emotional enough, so recently, we worked hard to revise it to something more human and aspirational. And that is what our mission statement is today, to âBe included.â What do we mean by that? Well when someone gains a physical address, their life changes; they can now get access to emergency and finance services that they could not otherwise get access to. They are now part of society. They are now included. As a side note, it often feels like certain elements of a company need to be 100 % right from day zero, such as the mission statement and values. A big learning from building OkHi is that it is much better to make a quick decision that is 80 % right than to worry about the last 20 % and potentially never make the decision at all."

One notorious example which appears to be of this type arises if I accidentally leave my coat behind in the cloakroom at the close of a conference session, and return the next day to find it still there.14 Knowing that there were dubious characters in the neighborhood when I left, and that many individuals had access to that cloakroom during my absence, I would reject as false the sentence: If my coat had been stolen, it would have been the most recent person to visit the cloakroom who would have stolen it. No doubt the first really dubious character who came by after I left was likely to take my coat, pre-empting any opportunity that the most recent nefarious visitor might have had. For such an example, it is difficult to say what the relevant sense of similarity between histories might be, but it seems clear nonetheless that no comparison with histories from other worlds is particularly apt. For external counterfactuals, we have a choice: we could base our account on a similarity relation between worlds or on a similarity relation between points of evaluation. For a sentence such as If the match were struck, it would light it might be most appropriate to compare moment/history pairs (without regard to what world they were in) and focus on the ones whose factual conditions were most similar to those at the point of evaluation. On the other hand, for Lewisâs example If kangaroos didnâ² t have tails, they would fall over backwards it might be best to refer to similar worlds, particularly since there are probably no suitably similar moment/history pairs in our world at which kangaroos lack tails, and it would take a very different world to include such situations in a coherent way. The moral of all this rumination about supermodels is that they open up considerable new prospects for exploration and exploitation. We now begin to glimpse the plausibility of supposing, for example, that different kinds of counterfactuals call for different accounts, and we see that supermodels might provide an environment friendly to such fine-grained discriminations. Moreover, it is not unreasonable to suppose something similar might be the case with accounts of causation, particularly if we suppose that counterfactuals play a major role in, or are in some other way closely connected with, an account of causation."

In reality it is somewhere between very hard and impossible. We often do not know what the most responsible moment is until that moment is long gone. That has often happened to me. I defer a decision to a later moment, because I feel that it would be irresponsible to decide now. At that later moment, I realize that I missed the opportune moment. This happens much more often than I care for. Every time it happens, I realize (once again) that my responsibility as an architect is not only to make and communicate technical decisions, but to make them at the right time. It is safe to say that as an architect I am always designing.

They could be educators and help the blind learn how to see; this is what science has done for the entire human race. But learning to see is a chore, so most, especially marketing people, are not interested. This is too bad, especially when we consider the efforts the two-eyed people like Ted have to go through to even have a glimpse happen. One of the keys is for the two-eyed people to turn into evangelists. Both Ted and our mutual hero, Douglas Engelbart, worked tirelessly over their lifetimes to point out that, in this dial-tone world, the emperor not only has no clothes but his cell phone canât transmit real music. Yes, Iâve mixed a metaphor or two. Another key is to make a working system of the future. This was ARPAâs and especially PARCâs main mission. Make something that works, not just for a demo, but for a group of people. Some of what I showed during my talk is what Steve Jobs saw, and the Macintosh was a result of his glimpse and also interpretations of that glimpse by him and others at Apple. But it missed a number of really important ideas. Many of Tedâs and Dougâs ideas have been missed. So, with all this working against someone like Ted, why bother having visions? Standard schooling is already trying to convert two-eyed children into standard children, that is, into blind children. Why not just put more effort into this and save all the bother? To me, the visionaries are the most important people we have because it is only by comparing their ideas with our normal ideas that we can gauge how we are doing. Otherwise, as it is for most people, normal becomes reality, and they only measure from that less broad view of reality. Toss Ted back into this mix, and youâve upset the Apple cartâand thatâs what we need! This allows us to see that normal is only one of many possible constructions of reality, and some of them could have been much better. In addition, the normal ideas in the future could be very different and much better from what is considered reality today. Letâs be very thankful that we live in a place where two-eyed people were really supported in the 1960s and at least tolerated today. And let us also be thankful that we have a two-eyed person like Ted Nelson who has been tirelessly energetic about not just having ideas but also about going out and telling people about those ideas, not letting them die, not letting them get absorbed into the low-pass filter.

The same with family relations. Some think that it is a bad idea to conduct business with your wife. But there are situations where it works well. (director, p10) The respondent does not detail the nature of the test. But this could mean, for example, giving a customer-friend credit without guarantees, or not demanding written, formal contracts which could be interpreted as a lack of trust between friends. Unlike in previous examples, friendships could also be built upon already existing business relationships. Some respondents considered this variation easier than the preceding one: In my opinion if a good business exists, a friendship will be born. The other way around is rarer and thatâs why I try to avoid building business with friends. (general director, p7) Another respondent supported this reflection by warning against starting a business with someone only because he is a friend. It may be pleasant to drink beer with a friend, but besides this, he may turn out to be a useless business partner: But the other way around [turning business into friendship] â as much as you like.

82,35,0.969,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"To say that infinitism has consistently had a bad press would be claiming too much. Infinitism had no press at all, since until very recently nobody took it seriously. The reason for this is not difficult to discern. In an epistemological tradition dominated by Aristotelian and Cartesian foundationalism, a position like infinitism is highly counterintuitive to say the least; for how could anybody, in Aristotleâs words, âgo through infinitely many thingsâ? It is therefore not surprising that infinitism is hardly, if ever, mentioned in treatises or textbooks; and if it is mentioned, then it usually serves as an example of a blatantly ridiculous way to go. Yet it cannot be denied that infinitism sits well with some modern ideas about the nature of knowledge, such as that knowledge is essentially fallible, and that the human search for it is, indeed, without end. Despite many attempts to show the contrary, it is not at all clear how these ideas, which so many of us endorse, can be smoothly combined with foundationalism or even coherentism.15 In this book we will investigate the consequences of an infinitist response to the regress problem. We do not propose to defend infinitism as such. Rather our aim is twofold. On the one hand, we intend to show that some standard objections to the position are not as strong as they might seem at first sight. On the other hand, we explain how our analysis of these objections brings about insights that cast new light on the traditional positions, foundationalism and coherentism; as we will see, a careful analysis of infinite justificatory chains will teach us interesting novel facts about finite ones. In the end we somehow try to get it all, sketching the contours of an infinitist version of coherentism, which also acknowledges the foundationalist lesson that we should somehow make contact with the world. We will return to this in the final chapter. All-important for the development of infinitism was the work by Peter Klein. Around 2000 Klein wrote a number of papers in which he took the bull by the horns and presented infinitism as a genuine competitor to coherentism and foundationalism. Here is how Klein introduces his view in a relatively early paper: The purpose of this paper is to ask you to consider an account of justification that has largely been ignored in epistemology. When it has been considered, it has usually been dismissed as so obviously wrong that arguments against it are not necessary. The view that I ask you to consider can be called âInfinitismâ. Its central thesis is that the structure of justificatory reasons is infinite and nonrepeating. My primary reason for recommending infinitism is that it can 15 For a prominent attempt at reconciling foundationalism and fallibilism, see Audi"

275,345,0.969,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In this experiment, the participants consistently rated option (b) as more probable than (a). However, according to the axioms of probability theory, the conjunction of events is less probable than a single event, so (b) must be less probable than (a). This type of judgement errors has been found so invariably that it became known as the conjunction fallacy (see [31, 34] for other such fallacies). These findings are not widely known, let alone implemented, by programmers designing the communication part of autonomous systems. The latter systems so far adhere to the laws of probability and logic, which is their strength. Their weakness, however, is to not account for how humans make decisions. For example, an intelligent system that would correctly answer (a) in the experiment above, might bewilder the human who was expecting answer (b). In turn this could erode that humanâs trust in such a system. Let us take another, more concrete, example from technology soon to become reality. Suppose you arrive late in the evening at a meeting. As the street is clearly indicated as a tow zone, you let your self-driving car find a parking space elsewhere to park in your stead. Later you come back and find that it parked in the first free spot in that same street. Would this not be the time to reconsider your trust in the autonomy of the car? And so you instruct it not to do this again. But then it politely explains [24] that the tow zone only applies during rush hour, thus restoring your trust. An even better scenario would be that when you leave the car to park itself, it would tell you that yes, this is a tow zone, but only during rush hour. Machines have become smart enough to do the first part, in this case finding a parking space and park. But then, is it not time to work on the second part, where the machine proactively explains its actions from the humanâs point of view? Or the part where it can foresee a human error because it knows how a human would reason in a particular case? This stands to hugely help humans put trust in autonomous systems, and in the current presentation we show a direction one could go. To elaborate the problem we want to address, before trying to solve it, consider Wittgensteinâs often cited remark âIf a lion could talk, we could not understand himâ ([37], p. 223). The remark has been food for much thought and speculation (that it is probably true) for half a century, notably in the philosophy of language. We wonder, however, that if we cannot even understand a lion, whence the confidence that we will understand machines when it comes to communicating with them verbally? Here we think that Wittgensteinâs own, less quoted, comment can lead the way [37]: If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgements. This seems to abolish logic, but does not do so â It is one thing to describe methods of measurement, and another to state results of measurement. (p. 391, our italics)"

To borrow your words, it is as you say that leading country in resolving societal problems has more opportunities for business commensurate with their status.

143,375,0.969,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"As a co-founder of AkiraChix, I looked to Silicon Valley to give me answers on how to work on the issue of womenâs low representation in technology. But over time, I realized we had a better chance of solving the issue for ourselves right here in Africa, because the technology ecosystem was young and in its formative stages. If we tackled the problem before it became as institutionalized as it is in Silicon Valley, then we had a better chance of success. I came to see that we are operating at the best time to address this problem. Our hope is that, 20 years from now, women will account for more than 40 % of the workforce in the field of technology. In order to achieve this vision, we want to scale to five training centers in towns and cities all over Africa. We also want to expand to the major urban centres within Kenya. And in order to reach more African women technologists, we plan to partner with hubs and co-working spaces all over the continent to support their initiatives of having more women represented in technology. We are currently developing the Akirachix model that we can share with interested people and organizations. This is the best way and time for us to write the story of African women in technology. How did you create a community for women? We started by having monthly meet-ups for women in technology. Over time, we realized that we were sharing a lot of information and knowledge among ourselves that other women could benefit from. We therefore decided to start a training program that targeted young women from low-income areas. We wanted to target young women who did not have an opportunity to be in the technology industry. Over time, we also started a high school program so that we could expose girls in secondary schools to careers in the technology industry. We had realized that many girls did not consider careers in technology, because they did not know about them, and if they did they did not see women whom they could identify with. As we continue to grow our community of women in technology, we have also realized that we need to work with men in the industry as our partners. This is because the women we work with do not exist in a vacuum. They work and study with men in school or on the job. One of the"

Only at a later stage (if at all) did I ask about the âmissing partsâ in their narratives. This was a highly sensitive endeavour in which I always had to keep in mind not to push too hard when my interlocutors signalled that they were reluctant to elaborate on a certain topic. These initial unstructured conversations with a loose agenda helped me to identify silences, the periods or events my interlocutors opted to leave out in their narratives. Though most authors agree that memory cannot be studied without its counterpart forgetting, few studies explicitly deal with forgetting, gaps and silences. Dealing with gaps and silences confronts the researcher with methodological difficulties. It is not only hard to interpret silences but even harder to locate them. Passerini quite rightly asks: âHow can we find traces of forgetting and silence since they are not themselves observable? We know that certain silences are observable only when they are broken or interrupted, but we want nonetheless to find themâ (Passerini 2003: 239; see also Connerton 2008; Fabian 2007). It is true that the ability of researchers to identify and interpret silences is restricted, but longterm fieldwork is a way of meeting this methodological challenge since relationships of trust often are achieved only after months or even years. Although I tried to avoid leading conversations along a clearly defined agenda, my interlocutors sometimes pursued such an agenda themselves. In such cases, their narratives were ready-made and presumably had been told several times before. I gained the impression that during their narration they were not so much remembering the event they were telling me about, but rather the last occasion they had told the story (see Bloch 1998). In such encounters my interlocutors clearly had an interest in sharing the âtruth about the pastâ and these discourses were hard to ignore. But narrative abilities are not equally distributed, so it was particularly important"

They are going somewhere, they want to go home, or shopping, or whatever. So they are not running awayâ. He continued to tell me about an event that had occurred recently: Two weeks ago we had one resident disappear. The two carers on the night shift called me. It was the weekend. They had looked everywhere, but they didnât find her. So they called me in the middle of the night and we eventually had to call the police, and they came with a helicopter. We looked everywhere in the surrounding woods. It was late at night. Eventually we found the resident in the closet of an empty room, anxious and distraught. We were lucky to find her inside the village. But you see, when youâre dealing with such cases, hearing peopleâs criticism of the fences becomes laughable. Obviously it would be nice to live in a free and happy environment, but if something happens to a resident, if they get lost, or if they drown in the lake, who will be held responsible? The same voices will ask: âWhy didnât anybody stop her?â Sometimes the dementia discourse is packed with hypocrisy."

This is frequently mentioned, and often as being specific to the father. For example, Mr B mentions his âtypicallyâ paternal skill of âknowing how to playâ: I think that, even though it might seem quite a caricature, my wife is very involved with organising thingsâ¦ she is less involved in playâ¦ Iâm more present when it comes to playing; I spend more time playing games with them (Valentin B, municipal employee, 38, partner waitress). Although they suggest that their play activities with the children have a regular schedule, always at the same time and integrated into a set timetable (usually between the nap and the afternoon snack), these activities are presented as being unplanned, not very organised, and spontaneous: âIâm more about the here-andnow, yes. More about having fun togetherâ (SÃ©bastien L, local engeneering executive engineering, 46, partner project manager in the voluntary sector). Some fathers even describe themselves as a âplaymateâ, without placing any educational or earlylearning emphasis on the activities. This is the case for Mr C., who describes having fun with, and alongside, his 2 sons: âbesides, they are boys (â¦) so itâs something we can really share. We play with the remote controlled car, building games, Lego, things that I enjoyed as a kid and so itâs something we have in commonâ (Fabien C, 34, engineer in the automotive industry, 34, partner IT engineer)."
14,233,0.968,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"It Is Not All About Ethnicity: Contesting the Ethnic MajorityâMinority Framework We have shown that the question of ethnicity plays an important role in the ways the interviewed youth perceive and construct their identities. However, there are other equally or even more important factors, common to all young adults irrespective of their origin, that in the eyes of the research participants shaped them into who they are. First love (reciprocated or not), ï¬rst âseriousâ relationships, friends, physical distinctions or defects (congenital or caused by injuries), or even travel experiences, experiences of living abroad, and hobbies that turned to passions all had a big influence on the lives of the study participants and their identities. Furthermore, the turbulent relationships with their parents should not only be seen as something connected solely to struggles caused by cultural gaps, but as something that normally occurs in the relationship between child and parent, irrespective of ethnic background. One of the themes that appear through Karelâs narrative is that of his ï¬rst serious relationship. His love for this Czech girl and the things that he learned from her, as he put it, introduced him to a radically different perspective and led him to re-evaluate his outlook on life and ideas about himself. Marek (twenty-seven), who came to Czech Republic at the age of nine, also mentions how his love for a girl while he was in primary school presented the main âmotivatorâ behind almost all his actions. In the case of forming my own âme,â I fell in love with a girl, I was into her from the age of nine and it took me more than three years to keep lying to myself about that I was not good enough, like I was telling myself that I am not sportive enough, smart enough and so on. This actually kept me going, kept me motivated in perfecting myself. Every time she declined my âoffers,â I was partially sad, partially pissed off and because she turned me down thirty-ï¬ve times in all, I at that time realized that you cannot get everything even if you really try hard. Because that was what I was thinking before, before I met this girl. So she really influenced me and I changed in the way that I wasnÂ´t that ambitious, choleric guy anymore but became more relaxed."

124,287,0.968,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"knowledge. That was to come later. As I recall, Belnap was working with Anderson at the time developing a new theory of ârelevance logic,â another area in which he has made significant contributions. My own dissertation director and philosophical mentor at this time at Yale was Wilfred Sellars, who soon after was to move to the University of Pittsburgh, along with Belnap and Anderson. Sellars was a compatibilist about free will, like the vast majority of scientists and philosophers of that era, and he did not believe that a libertarian free will requiring indeterminism could be accounted for without appealing to obscure forms of agency of the kinds Strawson had called âpanicky metaphysics.â Appealing to an influential distinction that Sellars had himself introduced into contemporary philosophical discourse, he granted that free will in some sense was an integral part of what he called the manifest image of humans and their world. But he did not believe that a traditional indeterminist or libertarian free will could be reconciled with what he called the scientific image of the world; and he challenged me to show otherwise. With the naÃ¯vetÃ© characteristic of a young graduate student, I suggested that I would return in a few weeks with an answer to this challenge. It has turned out to be a project of somewhat longer duration, still ongoing. It was a surprise therefore some 40 years later when I received in the mail a complementary copy of Facing the Future, sent to me by Nuel Belnap. It was not sent to me as a former student, but rather as someone who had in the intervening years written extensively on the free will problem, attempting to make sense of the libertarian free will, who might find the book congenial and a significant contribution to that project. (He had in fact forgotten I had ever been a student of his so many years ago and I had to remind him of the fact.) That our intellectual paths should cross this way after so many years was indeed fortuitous. For, as noted above, I do believe that FF provides a logical framework that is congenial to the project of making sense of a free will requiring indeterminism and hence to addressing the Intelligibility Question."

They also believed in me, for which I am incredibly grateful. I especially want to thank our Chairman Ronnie Chan. I have worked with Ronnie for 20 years, and it has been a very rewarding partnership. Together we built the Asia Business Council and now CAPS (Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society).

Sisters Wange and Biamo, our tutors, announced that we must respect the communityâs grief. The death of a leader meant that emotions would be running high at the hamlet level, and we did not want to get caught up in any conflict that might surface. This meant major changes to our plans for the practicum: the tutors decided that instead of going to the hauslain (hamlets) to do our community health projects, we were to stay inside the fence of the Open Bible Mission and work only with pastorsâ families, for our own safety. The next day, after the ambulance arrived from Goroka with the coffin, students clustered together anxiously as it was carried into the church. Behind the coffin walked a long procession of weeping mourners, their skin, and clothes caked with the regionâs distinctive orange-red earth. The deceased manâs close female relatives, held up by supporters as they climbed the small hill, fell to their knees in grief every few steps. We tried to keep a respectful distance. Once everyone had crowded into the church building, the Adventist students were called forward by the pastor. Priscilla strummed the acoustic guitar while they performed two gospel songs: the first in English, the second in Tok Pisin. As the final strains of âYu Yet Yu Bikpela Jisas (Jesus You are the Greatest)â faded away, the pastor returned to the pulpit and gave a sermon on the immortality of the soul: Our brother has left this body, and taken another body, it is the spirit and it is inside the presence of God in Godâs Kingdom. Dying and rising again, Jesus opened that road, he died on the cross and this opened the road to show us, all of us men and women on this earthâthose with big names, those who are money men, those who are rubbish men, all sorts of peopleâ all of us on this earth will die, there is only this one road that Jesus opened. Our brother here, he has taken this road. â¦ We can mourn, we can cry, but he is not completely dead. There will be a time when he is resurrected, just as Jesus was resurrected, and we will see and we will rejoice. Amen. This kind of [bodily] death, it is not total death. The spirit of the body that is inside your life, the Bible says this spirit will wake you again and you will be resurrected. You will leave the grave. You will take a new body. And you will become something else, as Jesus did. You will not die completely. The body can die and be finished, but the spirit today is with God in Paradise. â¦ The Bible says here, âThe body we bury, it will rot. The body that is resurrected,"

Some time back I heard you talk about the âPayPal Maï¬a of East Africa.â What makes it so valuable? Silicon Valley is both ecosystem and mindset. The ecosystem is a function of mature capital markets, supportive institutions, and experienced entrepreneurs. Itâs common to see successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley become investors, and for good reason: They offer capital and, more importantly, empathy and expertise. Look for example at all of the consumer Internet companies you know today, the big ones, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc. Most of them have PayPal employees invested in them. So when PayPal IPOed, it made a huge number of millionaires, and now those employees are seeding entire generations of investment and starting new companies. You see it in 500 Startups, too. I mean, itâs all over the placeâPeter Thiel with Palantir, Elon Musk with SpaceX and Tesla. These are all PayPal people. We want to see that same ecosystem develop in East Africa. Specifically, we talk about building the âPayPal Mafia of East Africaâ because we want our team to become the first batch of entrepreneurinvestors in the region.

While the majority of the interviewees refuse to be an active part of the media discourse (e.g. active in social media or giving interviews to journalists), all interviews emphasized the importance of social media. Social media is judged as a chance for the Catholic Church to reach people they would not reach otherwise: âbut if you want to reach people you have not reached before, then you have to walk new paths (â¦) find new paths which you havenât tried yet. And that can be done by using mediaâ (NKG275140136_2). However, the majority referred to the level that we can call translocal scope. For example, the interviewees often approve the Catholic participation in public debates by referring to figures such as the chairman of the German Bishopsâ Conference or Pope Francis. Media is seen as a possibility for those representatives in translocal positions to communicate via a strong Catholic voice in the public. When one priest was asked about his opinion on Cardinal Marx, he said: âAll the others are very reserved. However, it needs people who have the courage to go there [in talkshows, the authors] and to do it and I think Marx can do that. He is very communicativeâ (KÃD246150346_1). We can observe similar arguments when it comes to media coverage on Pope Francis. For example, one priest stressed the outstanding media-related characteristics of the pope: âHe was so good. Protestant colleagues envy us a little â¦ because suddenly you are the subject of debate for a few daysâ (KÃD246150346_1). Being active in media seems to be a necessary criterion for being part of the public discourseâand therefore abilities and character traits that are seen as compatible to the media are well appreciated in persons of a translocal authority position. At this point, we can observe a distinction between the different religious figures and roles within the organization and their relation to media. Whereas certain media skills are seen as a necessary characteristic for a translocal figure of authority, the same is not characteristic for local authorities. As one priest put it: âWell, I think it is important to say: we have to be active [in Facebook], as a parish. But that does not mean that I, as the priest, also have to do that, right?â Even if they stress the necessity for the Catholic Church to reach people outside the classical parishes, social media are not seen as the right tool for that within a local scope. Most of the priests see their area of influence as limited to their parish and try to hold up a local profile: âI cannot reach the public from Flensburg to Munich, but letâs say it like that: sometimes Iâm glad that we are different here in situâ (KÃD246150346_2)."
163,2,0.968,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"taxation, a view that intimately connects the spheres we call economy and society. This view on tax compliance changes our focus from legal explanations and economic quantifications to descriptions of the type of reciprocal relations that taxes and tax collection entail. As John Locke stated centuries ago, taxes open up issues about democracy and reciprocity. Here it is the latter that is in focus, although democracy plays a role as well. In this book I delve into taxation as creating relationships of various sorts, and I focus on the taxpayerâs perspective. Taxation is made possible by many things; the focus here is on the relations it creates between people, and between people and their state. I argue that in order to understand tax compliance and tax cheating, we have to look beyond law, psychological experiments and surveys to include tax collectors and taxpayersâ practices. What do they actually do? What are their views on taxation, in their own words? I explore the view of taxes as citizensâ explicit economic relation to the state and implicit economic relation to all other compatriots. Such a view brings us straight to the core of economic anthropology. I end the book with some thoughts about how to build and increase tax compliance if we are to take the creation of reciprocal relations through taxation seriously. Reciprocity is an old concept and many have advised me to think about other concepts instead. Yet the way I hear Swedes discussing why they pay tax and why they avoid doing so includes varieties of relations and expectations that I cannot find a better word for than reciprocity. This book is thus an amalgamation of several research projects; about the Swedish Tax Agency and about a group of Swedesâ avoidance of paying tax. In particular I draw on Chaps. 6 and 7 of my dissertation Illegal yet Licit: Justifying Informal Purchases of Work in Contemporary Sweden (2010). There are many quotes from the ethnographic interviews I conducted during my dissertation fieldwork, yet they appear in a different light when contrasted with the views and writings of the Swedish Tax Agency as they aim to make Swedes comply. When I write about the Swedish Tax Agency, I use pluralâthem. This is to acknowledge employeesâ voices, opinions and reflections about the society and the citizens they are set to tax. The plural also reflects that there are contrasting views within the Swedish Tax Agency. I am grateful for the encouragement and discussion about various aspects of this subjectâreciprocityâs importance in understanding tax complianceâwith colleagues inside and outside academia. I call them colleagues because of our common interest in tax compliance issues. In"

This points to the fact that we, of course, are also the readers hovering at the edge of the page of each diary, and, in turn, raises the puzzling question, unaccounted for in the narrative, of how we come to read these diaries. As we have seen, Selinaâs diary is never physically accounted for and Margaretâs, we discover, is burnt, down to its very last page (348). Within the novel itself, these texts leave no discernible trace; they, like the desire they record, exist only in Watersâ, and her readersâ, imagination. What the novel suggests, then, is that Waters has materialised the diaries for us so that they may retrospectively inhabit and expand the Victorian literary tradition, materialising experiences rendered invisible by the historical record. In fact, this is dramatised for us in the novel. When Margaret Prior first visits Millbank Prison in her role as Lady Visitor, she casts off convention and, instead of reading to the prisoners from the Bible, determines that she will listen to the women tell their own stories (22). The response of one of the wardens indicates the extent of Margaretâs subversiveness: âShe looked at me then and said nothingâ (22). Indeed, the convict women share in this silence: they have all but lost the ability to tell their stories, stumbling over their words (39). Or, rather, the legal system has made them tell their stories, and has coopted and told their stories for them, so many times that they seem divorced from the women themselves: âthe telling has made a kind of story of it, realer than memory but meaning nothing. I wish I could tell her that I know what such a story feels likeâ (40). Margaret knows what this feels like because she has witnessed the rewriting of her passionate history with Helen into a heteronormative narrative allows Helen to pass as an ideal of Victorian womanhood: âHelen attended Mr Priorâs lectures,â [Mrs Prior] said, âand, Margaret meeting her there, she was brought to the house. She was always a great guest of ours after that, and always a favourite with Mr. Prior. Of course, we did not know â did we Priscilla â that it was all on Stephenâs account that she came here. â You must not blush, Helen dear!â (102) It is significant, here, that Helenâs blush becomes an ephemeral sign which we are asked to read in the light of two contestatory explanations, and that Margaretâs agency, as well as her passion, is entirely written out. Her role in bringing Helen to the Priorâs residence is written into"

I would like to propose some additional metaphors that describe the architect. These are not distinct. Rather in an agile world each architect has all of them. Personally, I have acted in all these roles, often in many of them simultaneously. 9.1 The Tribal Elder In this role, the architect acts as the guardian of the collective memory. He has seen the domain evolve and the architecture evolve. He understands why decisions were made. He understands the deeper meaning of the various dependencies. He is also very expeâ rienced beyond the scope of the particular problem. He remembers mistakes that were made, and how they can be avoided. He remembers useful lessons. He has seen how many predictions that were made with certainty do not materialize, and he has seen many surprises. He has a wealth of stories that he is happy to share to make his point. He might not be as âhands onâ or as quick on his feet as some of the younger ones, but he more than compensates for that with maturity, understanding of human nature and experience. One of the challenges with retrospectives and with lessons learned, is how do we preserve these insights over time? How do we maintain a record of these lessons? In a lean or agile environment, this tribal elder is constantly making sure that lessons that were painfully learned are not forgotten. The challenges for a tribal elder are many. Too often he expects that people will accept his word on authority alone, rather than on the merit of his idea. On occasion we might ï¬nd that the tribal elder has lost touch with the times, as lessons learned a long time ago might not be relevant any more, and the tribe elder will try to keep us in line with dogmas that are no longer relevant. So this architect needs to be humble and to have a very good sense as to when his experience is of value, and when it is outdated. In my group, we are constantly caught up in the tension between a generic product and a customized product tailored to meet the customer. This tension has existed for over twenty years, and we periodically cycle from one extreme to another. Now, when someone suggests a shift from a generic product to a customized product or vice versa, the tribal elder (me) will tell stories of what worked and what failed in the past. The tribe elder will warn of pitfalls, while taking care not to dampen any enthusiasm."
62,536,0.968,"Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming: 17th International Conference, XP 2016, Edinburgh, UK, May 24-27, 2016, Proceedings (Volume 251.0)","3.2 Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias Stereotype threat describes the experience of any group who suï¬er from negative sterâ eotypes. In the case of women in technology (and also men in the caring professions, as just one other example), these negative stereotypes manifest as a general assumption that they will not have the skills they need to succeed. Such damaging ideas put people under threat, because they constantly feel they have to disprove them. There is a large body of research which supports the statements I will make in this section. Several examples are referred to in the excellent book Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine [4], and I will quote some of them here. For instance, research shows that womenâs ability to perform is hampered by their anxiety about negative stereotypes. Instead of being able to concentrate on diï¬cult tasks, a signiï¬cant proportion of their mental concentration is taken up by trying to quell their fears about their potential lack of ability [5]. My own experience bears this out. I have described in this paper how, after a few years in the profession, I found myself in a job where my requests to do more interâ esting work were denied. There was always a part of me which believed I was less capable than my male peers, and that it was therefore quite reasonable for those requests to be denied. I decided that I would be better off looking for success in other areas of my life â my family and my hobbies â and that I would accept that my job was simply something whose purpose was to pay the bills, rather than something I could expect to excel at or enjoy. Another problem is that the more successful a woman becomes in a male-dominated profession, the more she will be aï¬ected by stereotype threat. This is for several reasons: The more she moves up the ladder, the more of a minority she will ï¬nd herself in. This will make her more anxious about other peopleâs assumptions, but will also encourage her to believe â by sheer force of statistics â that those assumptions are true. âOne study found that the more men there are taking a mathematics test in the same room as a solo woman, the lower womenâs performance becomesâ [6]. The problem is not that girls are inherently less good at technology, or even that theyâre less interested; it is that people expect less of them. For instance, some men and women were given a diï¬cult mathematics test. Before they started, they were told that it was designed to better understand what makes some people better at mathematics than others. A control group were told the same thing, but were also told that thousands of students had been tested and no gender diï¬erence had ever been found. In all groups, the average score for men was 19 %. In the ï¬rst group, women also averaged 19 %. But in the second group, women averaged 30 %. Even though gender was not explicitly mentioned to the ï¬rst group, it did not need to be. They could make that connection for themselves, and their performance was aï¬ected. But once that stereotype threat was removed, the potential of the women appeared to be unlocked [7]. As well as stereotype threat, another important phenomenon is âunconscious biasâ. This is eï¬ectively the technical term for what I have referred to in this paper as an âinner voiceâ. It refers to the automatic connections that most of us make, for instance between women and the arts, and between men and technology."
57,102,0.968,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","Work With What You have We think of relations with respondents as a kind of role-play: we do not pretend to be anything other than ourselves, but we do present particular versions of ourselves that we think will help us build the relation, and establish the best possible connection with our respondents. There are widely different strategies for this, which have a little bit to do with oneâs personality, but actually more with how we are seen by others on the basis of ascriptive categories like nationality, age, and gender. Below, we set out some opposites to illustrate how different characteristics propel us towards different rolesâbut these are stylized foils. In reality, our interviewer persona is not so entirely fixed: it may evolve over time, it partly depends on the type of respondent, and sometimes we may even change gear in the midst of an interview to get more traction. Our researcher in India and Mexico, a young man doing research on forms of repression, typically tries to make the relation with respondents as informal as possible, often meeting people multiple times, looking for ways to break the ice, trying to make it âclickâ. This approach seems quite natural when meeting journalists or human rights activists, who often have values similar to our own. But he has also applied it with âagents of repressionâ: police or security officials. One of his most revealing interviews has been with a security agent in a bar, who was detailing how he harasses opposition politicians for a living, while drinking and using cocaine. For our Morocco researcher, a young woman operating in the Arab world, such an approach would be a recipe for disaster: diving into informality with a relative stranger, seeking repeat meetings, being in places where alcohol or drugs are consumed could all lead to misunderstandings. Instead, she stresses her professional persona, makes it clear that interviewing people is âworkâ, and while engaging in the necessary small talk as described above, she deflects questions about her private life. Our Kazakhstan researcher, operating in a context less marked by stereotypical views about the sexual morality of western women, steers an in-between course. She would not meet respondents at a bar or in the evening, but her approach is a little more informal. She uses her nationality, making assumptions about respondent impressions of Italian culture, and emphasizing similarities like the importance of hospitality, late dinners, and big weddings. Akin to the informal/professional divide, but a little different, is the choice to present ourselves as well-informed or naÃ¯ve. Naivety is a"

The only way scientists have obtained this knowledge is through an engagement with death.â Pastor DieudonnÃ© earned a License degree in physics (equivalent of an M.A.) from the University of Kinshasa (UNIKIN). After working as a teaching assistant at the university for a few years, he abandoned the academic world because he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his faith with his work as a scientific researcher. For Pentecostal Christians, any knowledge that distracts the Christian from Godâs path is perceived as anti-Christian. Knowledge in itself is not diabolical or divine, rather the difference lies in the source of knowledge. Some knowledge is God-given (euti epay ya Nzambe). Most Christians have received this gift of knowledge (bwanya ya Nzambe), which allows them to understand the world, to interpret signs of the material world as metonyms of invisible powers and spirits, and act upon it (Pype 2012: 112â115). However, other kinds of knowledge are inspired by the devil (ya Satani). To understand whether certain knowledge is âChristianâ or not, one should look into its consequences: does it sow death, as, for instance, the atomic bomb? Or does it harm people, as do weapons, for example? The types of knowledge that do not âcome from Godâ are abstract and irrelevant for daily social life. Pastor DieudonnÃ© explained how he had refused to continue his postgraduate studies at the university. Having finished his License degree with a dissertation on metallurgy, he felt uncomfortable with the level of abstraction that studies in physics entail. The mysteries of abstract thinking undoubtedly lead to the devil. According to pastor DieudonnÃ©: There were certain demands that I could not perform. Especially things that you cannot grasp with your five senses. We have five senses, but some scientific experiments rely on another sense. As a Christian, my 6th sense is my faith. If I cannot feel, taste, hear, see, or smell something then I need to believe that God is there. But, I know that in those sciences, people do not rely on God."

These men were highly engaged in a discourse of âinvolvedâ fatherhood. For example, when Jason and Kylie were asked how it is they came to be taking APL, Jason responds: I think I mean before even considering having children, we had always, without agreeing anything, thought that weâd share the [maternity] leave. Probably one for just to be equitable between the two of us, and where we were, we just make it work, whether it was financially supported by the government or not.

The length of leave (5 or 6 months) and the amount of time taken by each parent (one or more months, and when) always require a complex decision-making process in which the couple has to weigh up different factors: the impact of leave on each partnerâs career, employersâ openness to fathersâ leave-taking, the interests of the child (e.g. age for starting daycare) and those of parents (e.g. professional self-fulfillment; parental and gender equality values; reprisals in the workplace). All fathers had been informed of the new âsharing bonusâ contained in the 2009 law, but only some knew about the individual entitlement to the complementary parental leave compensated at 25 % of previous earnings. However, they all discussed the use of sharing bonus with their partner and informed the employer as soon as possible. Although these forerunner fathers began by âtellingâ their employer, as a mother would inform that she was pregnant and going on leave, they also describe having to enter into a process of negotiation, since employers did not readily accept fathersâ leave use as a natural right beyond the 2â4 weeks of paternity leave. As one father put it, contrary to what happens regarding the ânaturalâ inevitability of leave use by the mother, in the case of a man who is going to use parental leave the first reaction is to consider this as a choice or an option, which is often frowned upon by the employer. I think you have to put your foot down. I think that itâs because youâre a man that they say: âthis is not necessary, youâre doing this because you want to, you donât really need to do thisâ. Thatâs their idea of things, âlook, man, you donât need to do this, but if you really think you need toâ¦ well, itâs difficult to do without you here, but itâs your choiceâ. Whereas the mother, everyone accepts that the mother goes on leave, thatâs how it is, but a man there is the question of: âBut what do you think youâre up to?

But for others, the choice of language can have complicated political connotations, especially for researchers of local or dual heritage. Like our own Morocco researcher, a colleague of Moroccan descent who has grown up in Europe conducts interviews in French or English. This is not because he has difficulty speaking the local dialect of Arabic, but because his accent would lead a respondent to make immediate assumptions regarding his familyâs regional background and social class. His fluent English and French and prestigious academic affiliations can offset this, but in turn cause him to be seen as more of an outsider. By contrast, a colleague of Turkish descent who has spent most of his adult life in Europe finds that his accent gives him easy access to elite circles, but can cause him to be distrusted by ordinary Turks, and even more, Kurds. He prefers to use English in his engagement with Kurds in Europe. Even when we get started with the real interview, there is always an initial part where you try to measure each other. As researchers, we try to assess how much we can push, not starting right out with the big questions. If we feel that there is a difficulty with a particular question, we may skip it and return to it later. Not all of this is about political sensitivities: not everyone is used to giving concise, to-the-point answers even to straightforward questions, and multiple approaches may be needed to get a question understood and answered. But when sensitive topics are being broached, it is all the more important to engage in a careful ritual dance. Showing up like a newshound, pen in hand and firing off questions will alienate even well-disposed respondents. We have all experienced situations in which establishing trust was unusually difficult. We will illustrate three of the four most common reasons, as we have encountered them: suspicion, ideological hostility, fear, and personality. An example of suspicion was experienced recently by our China researcher, who was exposed to a kind of reverse interview by a policy-maker. For half an hour, she was asked directly and indirectly what she wanted, why she does this kind of research, why foreigners are interested in the details of Chinese policy-making, why our project got a big grant, what the EUâs interest in providing such grants might be, and so on.

Participating in social events like slametan is very important for the rural people. Moreover, women are responsible for preparing food for such events and this presents a challenge for diabetics. One woman who used to help with cooking sent a message to Tuti: Nek ora diicipi wedi ra enak, ning meh kabeh legi. Piye yo? (if I donât taste the food, Iâm afraid that the taste is not quite right, but almost all are sweet, what should I do?).

People usually mix tetes with water and ice to make es tetesâan irresistibly refreshing drink for a hot day at the market. When I met mantri later that evening, he told me that some of the women had been enquiring about the health effects of the food they consume daily, including tetes. For example, one of his patients texted him to ask: Nopo tetes saged nginggilaken gendis? (Could tetes drink increase my blood sugar?). When I interviewed this woman, Darni, she explained that her glucose level was constantly high and she wanted to know whether her love for tetes caused this problem, âIf youâre poor, itâs a refreshing drink that poor people can afford, because itâs cheap. I can drink two glasses especially during a long hot day at the market.â Mantri responded to Darniâs text with simple suggestion: Please try to drink water.

But the scheme is inscribed into the constitution and thus I found it surprising to see the Wikipedia entry for GNH quickly changed into past tense, claiming that it had been abolished. The only source for that was a New York Times article in which no proof was to be found. Later articles and speeches of Tobgay, like this quote in The Guardian, cast a different light: Whatâs changed with our government is that we believe our priority must be at home â¦ We must remove the obstacles to GNH and be true to it within the countryâ¦ But the job of government is not to lead debate; it is to implement the principles at home.

53,54,0.967,"Healthcare, Frugal innovation, and Professional Voluntarism : a Cost-Benefit Analysis","volunteers, especially doctors, refer immediately to the potential for clinical skills enhancement. And, post placement, professional volunteers report gains in clinical skills achieved through the sheer volume of cases they encounter; their exposure to diseases that are unusual in the UK; conditions that are rarely seen due to early or preventive intervention (the outcomes of delays) or, quite commonly, scenarios that they would have limited direct (hands-on) access to due to their status (in terms of seniority or cadre). One of the most tangible and obvious beneï¬ts of spending time in a low-resource setting concerns the large volume of cases and the access that clinicians are likely to have, even at a relatively junior stage in their careers, to these. The idea that learning is gained through repetition (case volume) is captured by theories of learning focused on âdeliberative practiceâ which suggest that individuals acquire or hone skills through practice (Ericsson et al. 1993). Skills enhancement here relies on an assumption that the learner has been taught the skill in the ï¬rst place, and it is use of that skill that perfects the skill and builds conï¬dence in its utilisation; similarly, lack of practice may result in skills wastage or more likely in waning conï¬dence. This form of learning, through repeated use of pre-existing skills, could arguably happen in the absence of supervision but may be signiï¬cantly enhanced when the learner has access to a âmore knowledgeable personâ (Kolb 1983; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). An experienced midwife volunteer described the gains she feels she made in terms of clinical skills: Some of my clinical examination skills are ten times better than before we came out. In the UK we lose our basic skills and midwifery skills of how to palpate a uterus and to say which position the baby is lying in because if thereâs any doubt we just send for a scan. I had a woman who came and I felt her abdomen and she saw it on my face â she said, âyou think Iâve got two babies donât you?â I said, âI really do think youâve got two babies in thereâ. She laughed, she said she had a scan the week before and it said single baby but there were too many poles and too many limbs for it to be one baby. I said Iâm not happy with that scan result I want you to go to [hospital] and have another scan and ring me. In the evening I got a telephone call. She said âI have twinsâ! How fabulous that?"

In addition, the permits did not allow them to carry out any activity other than agricultural work. However, for some women, abandoning the fields clearly represented a better alternative to the harsh working conditions, even though they faced an uncertain future. Many ended up in the personal care/domestic work sector. Khady explains that after leaving the greenhouses in Huelva, she joined some friends settled in Barcelona. She lived for some time with them before leaving for Tarrasa: After leaving the strawberry fields, I was trying to survive as I could.

278,1,0.967,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Industrial ecology has come of age: it has its own journal, its own society and, in this volume, a first full retrospective â âtaking stockâ of its first quarter of a century as a scientific field. It is a remarkable achievement. To speak of society as having an industrial ecology would barely have been understood, as little as three decades ago. Early in the 1990s, I submitted an article for a newspaper with the phrase industrial ecology in it, only to have the editor send it back to me, corrected to industrial âeconomyâ. At the time, we all knew exactly what the industrial economy was (or thought we did), but clearly industrial âecologyâ could only be a typo. When I explained that it was not, the editor deemed it best to remove the term, because âno one would understand itâ. Two decades later industrial ecology is a clearer concept than industrial economy. The former even has its own Wikipedia entry; the latter, strangely, does not. Language is a curious commodity. Its malleability appears sometimes to be almost infinite. Meanings change and mutate over time, as intellectual territory is created and destroyed. We can respond to this linguistic contortionism in several distinct ways: at least two of them are wrong. One of the wrong ways is to suppose that the meanings embedded in terms are not just fixed but rightly so. We can spend a lot of time and energy defending the territory that language creates: defile my meanings at your peril; they are part of my identity and protect my legitimacy in the world. This is a subtly disguised variant on G. E. Mooreâs (1903) naturalistic fallacy: what is, is what ought to be; and woe betide offenders. The best way to avoid such an error is not to be too attached to the precision of language. Alternatively we can celebrate the loss of meaning in late, postmodern, advanced consumer capitalism, where nothing is any longer sacred, and definition counts for naught. Accepting this fluidity of meaning, it is all too easy to allow ourselves to float above rigour and define away contestation. In fact, a cynical variation on this theme is to deliberately employ such tactics to create your own territory. Academics throughout the ages have fallen foul of this.

His last brag was that he gave the world a potential solution for world peace. He hated violence, yet supported the Vietnam War, both Iraq Wars, and a host of other US military actions abroad. He believed absolutely in our military buildup during the Cold War and continued to support it even after the Berlin Wall came crashing down. At various times, heâs been accused of being a war hawk. Thereâs still a framed cartoon from the 1970s on the wall in our family home where my Dad is lampooned as a war hawk, standing next to a colleague shown as a peacenik. He found it so absurd as to be funny and worth memorializing. He could be confusingly contradictory. I used to think of him as a ï¬scal Republican and a social Democrat, but then he really deï¬ed all labels. Iâve always believed weâre a complicated species in a complex universe we barely understand. Our world is organic, with messy boundaries and beautiful colors. Itâs impossible to impose upon it our black and white organizational grids without running into contradictions of their very purpose. Iâve never met someone with strong opinions who didnât sometimes look like a hypocrite. In that way, my father was like any other. He had layers of rationalizations for his hierarchy of beliefs. He wouldâve called it all logical and scientiï¬c, but the rationalization of beliefs is a skin-deep penetration into my Dad. In truth, I think there are deeper reasons for his contradictions that lend insight but can never fully explain them. He understood gestalt and that âYou simply canât divorce â¦ personal elements from your work.â In the end, he did manage to separate aspects of himself, very private personal elements that he didnât want to look at or reveal, proving we are all mysteries and contradictions unto ourselves. My parents grew up in broken families ï¬lled with pain and sorrow, both suffering through trauma at a young age. My motherâs formative years were indelibly scorched by the horrors of World War II in Japan, particularly the US ï¬rebombing of Tokyo. Her earliest memory is jumping into a ditch to avoid ï¬re, her house aflame. Her father was a violent alcoholic who abandoned her and her mother when she was young. My fatherâs parents were poor and irresponsible, and their relationship was equally conflict-ridden. He remembered being so hungry he searched for food crumbs in his pocket. Out of desperation, he ran away from home in his teens, living in the streets of slums. Other than these publicly related facts, I donât know much more about either of my parentsâ upbringings. Their combined traumas left them defensive of too much"
57,112,0.967,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","Being Manipulated As described above, we assume that respondents have a particular version of the truth that they want to share with us, perhaps even an agenda, and while it can be challenging to figure out how to value and triangulate different accounts, we consider this part and parcel of our craft. But occasionally, we have encountered more blatant forms of manipulation. It is easy to suggest in the abstract that one should not fall for such attempts, but in practice it can, for different reasons, be difficult to avoid being manipulated. We describe a few of our experiences and try to draw some lessons. One such pitfall is the âresentful respondentâ, who may have valuable information to share, but has his own reasons (resentment against the system in general, or against a particular person) to speak to us. On one level, such a person can give us access to information that we would otherwise not be able to get. However, precisely because such data cannot easily be triangulated, it is more than usually difficult to assess its veracity. A second risk is that, unless we can keep the contact entirely confidential, it may interfere with the willingness of others to trust and speak to us. Both our India and our Kazakhstan researcher have encountered a âresentful respondentâ. Whereas the India researcher has cultivated the contact while being aware of the risk of manipulation, the Kazakhstan researcher decided to forego the opportunity. The difference lay not so much in their ability to judge the veracity of the respondentâs account, as in their research topic, and the associated opportunity cost: the Kazakhstan researcher feared it would interfere with the relationship she was building with other party cadres, whereas the India researcher was already focusing on regime critics rather than insiders, so had little to lose. Our Iran researcher has experienced the opposite situation: being manipulated by a former dissident turned regime informer. He met this young journalist, who wrote about films and had reformist leanings, on his first visit to Iran, spent time with him regularly, and developed a friendship. On a return visit, the journalist told our researcher he had been arrested before and feared another arrest. He instructed our researcher that if he should drop out of contact, the researcher was to deliver a prewritten press release reporting the journalistâs renewed arrest to Reporters Without"

The tale of the last legitimate European self-certitude about puppets on a string that does not break because it is programmed to move inexorably toward death, while we (stinginess is sexy! as a popular German ad campaign proclaims) try to console ourselves with golden coins? Why shouldnât we spin fables that go beyond this last myth of European modernity,10 without automatically being stigmatized as trying to take refuge in a backward world? Why shouldnât we, without automatically choosing the opposite path, hear the crow of the rooster not only as the call to nihilism but also as a call to a future beautiful morning? Would it set off too many idiosyncrasies? We are so forgiving of fools of the theater. Why not give them some credit? But everyone is on credit.

Employers depended on them to keep the house in order and make sure the children were taken care of.

208,133,0.967,Actors and the Art of Performance,"punishment too.â36 Vindictiveness is powerful and tenacious. It rips the potential out of life, and can poison it permanently. But if we look more closely at actors and feelings and start with the common reproach that actors are guided by their emotions, do we not have to admit that the actorâs typical weak spot is, in truth, affect? Arenât actors always a little bit too loud, a little bit too excited, a little bit too weak of will, too worried about the impression they make? Arenât they all too ready to ride the waves of their emotions? Arenât their feelings always jumping here and there, unfaithful and dangerously easy to seduce? Arenât there enough contemporary examples of this in political history? Arenât actors per se refugees of reason? The actor has spirit, but little conscience of the spirit. Always he has faith in that with which he inspires the most faith â faith in himself. Tomorrow he has a new faith and the day after tomorrow a newer one. He has quick senses [ ... ] and capricious moods.37 Or do we need to turn what we have said about the actorâs disposition on its head and concede that the actorâs occupation forces him to ride the waves of emotion? What else could he do? You cannot swim or act on dry land. Acting is overflowing, chaotic, passionate, peripheral and proliferative. Is there more? Not even Brecht could have worked with actor cut-outs. Only a philistine can therefore demand the following of an actor: First, the collegium logicum.

With no information during the journey to Barnahus, Isac had been worried about whether his father was going to be there when they arrived. That would have been a very difficult meeting, he said. He was also worried about what was going to happen afterwards. Isac and his siblings had to stay at the Barnahus for several hours, waiting for the result of the assessments of the child welfare service and necessary arrangements. Now and then somebody entered the room, giving information or asking questions and the children took the chance to ask questions. This gave them a feeling of hope and of being involved. They sat there the whole day, from arriving in the morning until half five or five, each with a teacher and the special representative, except for the interviews and a short visit to buy groceries, and the room became crowded. There were several opportunities for worries and uncertainties: I was hoping to avoid having to go homeâmy father had found out everything. He would probably not be too happy.

Mobile commerce is a familiar segment to people who have heard about M-PESA, for example, and about mobile banking in Africa. However, we did not start out, 14 years ago, in mobile commerce. We started as a mobile content provider, selling music downloads over mobile phones. At the time, we knew there were going to be a big opportunities in mobile, but we did not know what shape or size they would come in. After about three or four years of selling digital content, we noticed a couple of things. First, notably, that our early adopters were rural or near-urban and slightly older, in their early 30s and mid-30s. This was interestingâand very different from what we had expected. We had gone into the business thinking our customers would be urban, slightly younger, more tech savvy, and richer. Second, we noticed that when we offered music and ringtones on credit, so that customers could pay the one-dollar cost in three or four chunks, then our sales generally quadrupled. The basic thinking began to form around the fact that a lot of the services on mobile were really mass market, meaning that if you could build useful services they could reach large numbers of consumers and that if you could find a way to innovate on the payments model then you could actually charge fair value for servicesâa dollar for a ringtone, for example, even though the average top-up value at that time was just slightly over half a dollar. This triggered a new thought process on the mission of the business. The goal was very clear since our founding: We wanted to build a billion-dollar enterprise. We set out on a plan that suggested we could get there if Cellulant had 100 million customers using our services and made USD1 per customer per month. By 2008, it had become clear that mobile payments and mobile money were going to be a big space, and we began to look actively at these as a potential future for us, thinking we could basically leverage the payment innovation we had developed for music and ringtones on credit into a mainstream payment system."

They had one other option: Hasan, who worked as a house painter, was offered a painting job in Belgium through an acquaintance and was promised 2000 marks per month. He would have gone alone, leaving Aysel and their son behind. Yet Aysel did not want the family to be separated. So it was Hasan who first passed the Turkish border in 1996, entrusting himself to a group of âkanalcÄ±â, which is slang for âsmugglersâ. Aysel undertook the journey with her son, then 3 years old. They walked from 10 at night to 5 in the morning, passing under barbed wire. âHe was so small then, and it was night. He wanted to sleep, he wanted his bed, he wanted his comfort. We had to carry him all the way; he cried a lot. Fortunately, there were many men in the group and they helped carry him. I could not stand on my feet for at least a week afterwards.â Aysel and Hasan stayed in the migrant settlements located where Ayselâs mother lives. The mother had immigrated in 1989, and she was the one who paid the smugglers. In retrospect, Aysel is somewhat regretful about the decision to come to Turkey: âIf I had known it would turn out to be like this here, I would have urged him to go to Belgium. To have to resort to those means [meaning the smugglers], to have struggled so much; it just was not worth itâ¦ We thought we would work a bit and then go back.â However, when their child began school, they felt that he would have a better chance in Turkey and that he could no longer adapt to life in Bulgaria. It was a struggle to get Olcay allowed to attend school. Hasan had to go to the school every day, along with three other mothers whose children could not be registered because of their irregular status. They pleaded, insisted and protested; in the end, it was the principalâs advocacy that they were able to get the children the necessary residence permits to attend school. Once their son had the certificate, Aysel and Hasan qualified for the âaccompanying person permitâ ( refakatÃ§i izni)âa special residence permit given to those who are accompanying minors, the elderly, or the sick. Each time Hasan had to go to the Foreignerâs Department to renew the permit, he encountered the same problem: he would be told that the date of the permit had expired. Hasan explained that he could renew the permit only when Olcayâs school opened again in the autumn, which meant that there was an inevitable gap of 3 months between the date of expiration and the date of renewal. âI have not left the country, I am renewing the permitâ, I said to them. ââYou still have to payâ, they would tell me. Once I went to speak with the head officer. He could not care less. âWhat is it to me?â he asked. That really blew my fuses. He said, âWe will just get you and throw you outâ. I said, âOkay, then throw me outââ. Aysel intervened: âI hate going to the Foreignerâs Department. Hasan gets angry and I end up paying the price.â âBut you inquire about somethingâ, Hasan said in self-defence, âand they never answer properly. Each time you go back, they find yet another missing document. Each time, I lose a dayâs worth of work. And I have to get in the queue at five in the morning. In the end, you just lose it, you know.â Aysel and Hasan live in an extremely well-kept little flat in an otherwise dilapidated migrant settlement in an outer Istanbul suburb that hosts a low-income population. Such settlements were commissioned by the state for the earlier wave of 1989 migrants, but they were not completed on time. Meanwhile, most of the 1989 migrants were able to move into better housing and the flats were left to deteriorate."

Am I interpreting her rendering in much more positive terms, because I have her open acknowledgement âthat Mother is very fortunate to be able to afford such care, and that I am very fortunate to have her near â but not in â my homeâ (14)? Given that the issue of gender is part of how we read a narrative, I wonder whether we absorb Foxâs photo book, Lindberghâs memoir or even Spohrâs account â which is, after all, written in the emotional turmoil of losing the beloved husband â with deeper involvement as they are told by a woman, with whom I, as a gendered reader, might in addition identify more ï¬uidly. I ï¬rst became invested in this question, when studying ï¬ctional accounts centred on dementia caregiving, and felt particularly drawn into deliberations on such predetermined reading where author and narrator, alias main protagonist, had the same sex.52 I believe this question to be particularly pressing, given that the female perception of their ailing relative â and, thus, their choice of illness and patient presentation â may signiï¬cantly differ from male approaches, not least since men are rarely primary caregivers and, additionally, rather deï¬ne themselves autonomously.

252,6,0.966,The Ethics of Vaccination,"an âethics of vaccinationâ is necessary in order to establish a stateâs responsibility with regard to the fight against common infectious diseases. For the sake of clarity, I should specify that there is one aspect of vaccination ethics that I will not mention in this book. Actually, there is more than one ethical issue related to vaccination that I will not address in much detail, and I will explain why in Chap. 1. But there is one particular issue that not only will I not address, but also I will avoid mentioning at all: pharmaceutical companies, or the âBig Pharmaâ, make a profit out of vaccines and therefore have an interest in governments implementing coercive vaccination policies. Of all the arguments you would hear against vaccination or coercive vaccination policies, this is the weakest one, and one that does not require or deserve much philosophical consideration. For this reason, I will only briefly explain in this preface why, despite its popularity (at least within certain circles), I will leave it aside in this book. Coercive vaccination policies are, morally speaking, either right or wrong, justified or not justified. Pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines certainly make a profit out of coercive vaccination policies. But so what? I suppose that those who appeal to the âBig Pharmaâ argument picture some sort of conspiracy scenario where governments are lobbied by pharmaceutical companies, or even bribed by them, to introduce coercive vaccination policies in order to pursue the companiesâ interests. Of course, lobbying and bribery by private for-profit companies are wrong for a number of reasons, and governments should take measures that are in the public interest, instead of in the private interests of a few companies. However, when public interest and private interest of pharmaceutical companies overlap, the fact that private companies profit from the pursuit of the public interest does not matter, morally speaking. Suppose I succeed at demonstrating that states have a moral obligation to implement compulsory vaccination. In this case, the fact that pharmaceutical companies benefit from such policies is irrelevant: good on them and good on us all who will be protected from infectious diseases; in fact, itâs a win-win. Moreover, suppose that governments have a moral obligation to implement compulsory vaccination policies, but that the reason why they implement such policies is that they are lobbied or bribed by âBig Pharmaâ; even in this case, the vaccination policies would not be immoral. We should of course be concerned about lobbying and bribery, but not about the vaccination policy itself; even in this case, the Big Pharma argument is not a good argument against coercive vaccination policies. If, instead, you think that coercive vaccination policies are not morally obligatory or even"

However, in this and the following chapter, I will explore ChÃ¡vezâs appeal by turning my attention away from his public persona for a while. That does not imply that I want to remove ChÃ¡vez from my analysis; rather I posit that we have to slightly shift our perspective. If we focus too much on ChÃ¡vez as a charismatic figure and ideologue, we miss the opportunity to appreciate the âthick background,â to paraphrase Geertz (1973), which preceded and prepared the ground for peopleâs support of the successive ChÃ¡vez governments. In my analysis I will therefore focus on the shared historical experiences of marginalization and collective struggle that people from the popular sectors perceived as the background for embracing ChÃ¡vezâs political project. We will then be better equipped, I believe, to turn our attention back to ChÃ¡vezâs persona and understand how he was able to incite such popular support. However, before we proceed, it is necessary to dwell a bit on the recurring classification of ChÃ¡vez as a populist. Populism as a concept has been closely associated with Latin American politics though it has, in recent years, also been used to explain new political movements in Europe, the former Soviet Union and even contemporary US politics. Populism as a political style is generally understood to have surged in Latin America from the 1930s to the 1950s, supporting import-substitution industrialization (Weyland 1999:379) and gaining support from the working class. Examples of politicians embracing this approach are Juan PerÃ³n in Argentina, LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas in Mexico and Jorge EliÃ©cer GaitÃ¡n (who was murdered) in Colombia.

When we entered the market, the majority of Kenyan adults had M-PESA on their phones, but less than one percent of businesses formally accepted it. So imagine if you were walking around with a payment card in your wallet but you couldnât find anywhere to pay with it. The utility of that card would be diminished significantly. So we said to Safaricom, âLet us help you acquire merchants so people can pay for everyday goods and services with M-PESA.â We were the first to do that in the mobile money industry, and we are currently the largest third party doing it. Why did you decide to incorporate in the U.S.? We incorporated in the U.S. because we are Americans and planned to raise money from U.S. investors. For tech startups in the U.S., you either incorporate in your home state, in the state of your investor(s), or in Delaware as a C corporation. For a U.S. technology investor, thatâs kind of the gold standard. So all lawyers in the U.S. are educated or taught on Delaware Case Law. C corporations can raise money from local and international investors. They have good board protections etc. So because we were raising money in the U.S., we incorporated in Delaware and have a branch in Kenya rather than a subsidiary. All of our shares are domiciled in Delaware, and thatâs again for investors. If we had a subsidiary, then weâd have shares sitting in Kenya, and that can complicate things in an exit.

She seemed to be in great pain: at the height of a contraction she screamed deeply and desperately. Meanwhile, HÃ©lÃ¨ne remained silent and immovable. Her calm comforted and irritated me at the same time. How could she leave Lisa suffering without doing anything beneath murmuring now and then that Lisa was doing very well? It seemed to be endless and circular: silence, a throaty groaning swelling to a scream accompanied by metallic rattling and silence again. Then all of a sudden the midwife moved forward to take a look between Lisaâs legs. She stayed next to Lisa, telling her to breathe shortly. Holding my breath, I noticed the babyâs head appearing slowly. His slick and bluish body followed easily. Lisa took her child and lay downâshe seemed exhausted but suddenly very present and relieved. I was overwhelmed: still shocked by the force of Lisaâs contractions which had seemed to be torturous but amazed by this unbelievable miracle I just had been part of. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was witnessing Lisaâs birth: Highly attentive, she was sitting an armâs length away from Lisa who was absorbed by the enormous effort and pain of giving birth to her child. HÃ©lÃ¨ne knew that everything went fine. Lisa found her own strategies of handling the birthing pain and by doing so she enacted HÃ©lÃ¨ne as a witness. In the situation described, witnessing compromises embodied1 interrelatedness in a particular environment. The witnesses presence has to be characterized as an intervention: an activity which shapes and constitutes what happens but which is shaped and constituted by what is happening as well.

In a second step, I will elaborate on witnessing in midwifery care with the help of my empirical findings. Firstly, I am going to introduce and confound two widespread stereotypes in midwifery care: the knitting midwife and the head-led woman in labour. In doing so I would like to demonstrate that witnessing signifies âbeing-withâ and relates to mutual obligations; I also point out the limits of witnessing.

Our government watches us, and in general, we donât commit crimes because we know we could be caught. It is important that we know that we might be watched at any time, but that we can never know for sure whether we are watched now. âPower should be visible and unverifiable,â Foucault wrote, âthe inmate must never know whether he is being looked at at any one moment, but he must be sure that he may always be soâ (201). George Orwellâs novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) describes this kind of intensely surveilled state perfectly. In the decades since Foucault wrote about the panopticon, the nature of surveillance has changed greatly. We are watched to a far greater degree than when Foucault was alive, with surveillance cameras on every street corner and the NSA and many other entities able to access our emails or phone calls. Itâs not clear that todayâs surveillance functions in the regulatory way Foucault described, disciplining us to be well-behaved citizens. Surveillance has become complicated in the digital age. Even the word has been altered. Roger Clarke defined dataveillance (1988) as âthe systematic monitoring of peopleâs actions or communications through the application of information technologyâ. Steve Mann and collaborators coined other variations. Sousveillance plays upon the French word sous, meaning âunderâ, in contrast to sur which means âoverâ, and it refers to ordinary citizens watching authorities, for instance using wearable cameras. Coveillance is peers watching each other (Mann, Nolan, and Wellman 2003). In his book The Googlization of Everything, Siva Vaidhyanathan argues that we need a new term to describe todayâs surveillance, as it is fundamentally different from the panopticon Foucault described. Vaidhyanathan proposes the term cryptopticon. The most important thing about todayâs cryptopticon, Vaidhyanathan (2011) writes, is that âwe donât know all the ways in which we are being watched or profiled â we simply know that we are. And we donât regulate our behavior under the gaze of surveillance. Instead, we donât seem to careâ (112). According to Vaidhyanathan, we donât know all the ways in which we are being watched, but we know that they are extensive, and that we are watched by many different entities: governments, corporations and criminals. In the years after Vaidhyanathan coined the term cryptopticon we have debated the Snowden leaks and had ongoing discussions of how Facebook and other web services track us, and we actually know quite a lot more about how we are being watched.

252,47,0.965,The Ethics of Vaccination,"The idea I have just formulated is sometimes referred to, more simply and more intuitively, with the term âduty of easy rescueâ: positive duties of âeasy rescueâ can be as compelling as negative duties, both ethically and legally (Savulescu 2007). For the moment, let us confine ourselves to the ethical dimension. To recall Peter Singerâs famous thought experiment, if I see a child drowning in a pond whom I could easily save at a comparatively small cost to me (e.g., at the cost of ruining my new pair of shoes), then I have a moral obligation to save the child (Singer 1972), even if the obligation is an instance of a positive, and not of a negative, duty. The child has a positive right to be saved, considering how comparatively easy and costless it is for me to save her. Tim Scanlon made the duty of easy rescue even less demanding by stating that we have an uncontroversial moral duty to do something that involves a slight or moderate sacrifice (in absolute, not in comparative terms) and that can prevent something very bad from happening (Scanlon 1998, p. 224)âa formulation that, unlike the Singerian one, does not entail that we have a moral duty to do something that is very costly to us if the outcome to be prevented is comparatively very bad. Here, to make my point as uncontroversial as possible, I will stick with Scanlonâs less demanding formulation. What I want to point out is that since vaccination entails a very small cost to individuals and a very large benefit to others in terms of disease prevention, there is a duty of easy rescue to be vaccinated, even if it is a positive duty, in order to protect the categories of vulnerable individuals I have mentioned in the previous chapter. If non-vaccination harms or risks harming others, then failing to vaccinate is as bad as positively doing something that harms or risks harming others, as Flaniganâs analogy suggests. But we need to be careful here. As I have noted earlier, the contribution of each individual vaccination to herd immunity is negligible. It is true that if a non-vaccinated individual does infect another individual, then the non-vaccinated individual would be causally and morally responsible for the harm caused to the other (Giubilini et al. 2018) or at least the individualâs carers would be. However, as suggested above, where herd immunity does exist, it is very unlikely that a non-vaccinated individual would infect another one; and where vaccination rates are extremely low, a nonvaccinated individual would not make a significant difference to the risk of another individual being infectedâif she does not infect a specific individual, someone else probably will and epidemics will occur. The risk that a non-vaccinated individual would actually make a significant difference to the chances that another individual is harmed is therefore significant only if vaccination rates in oneâs community are within a certain specific"

One pair of siblings expressed it as: âThe older one of us wants the parent who does not have the children with them to be all right when the children are with the other parent. Doesnât want them (the parents) to be sad even if they live in separate houses. Wants them to do things that make the children happy.â We interpret this to mean that it can be a burden for the children to think about their parents missing them. Another example of this is from a 10-year-old girl who says she feels a little bit guilty when she spends time with just one of them, but she has a solution: âI want you to live together â be with you at the same time.â When the children talk about their parents missing them, many see it in terms of what is fair. The children often understand fairness in terms of children sharing their time equally between the parents: âI want to be fair â spend just the same time with bothâ (13-year-old girl). One pair of siblings say: âWe are ï¬ne. We can stay one week with each of them, that makes it fair for both mum and dad. And then there is no need for dad to miss us.â The material shows clearly that the children feel particularly sorry for and/or are worried about their father. One of the children says the following: âI think about dad a lot â that heâs going to be all right. That he needs to know that I love him.â Some of the children are worried about the future and say they miss their parents, that they are not used to spending long periods away from one of them. Some fear that the parent they see least of is going to disappear altogether. A large number of the children talk about having emotional problems as a result of the divorce. Others point to the practical consequences of the relationship breakdown. For many it is important that the parents live near each other, and also near the school. They do not want to change schools, and it is important to keep their friends after the separation. Some experience a conï¬ict between the wish to spend time with the parents and the consequences this has for life outside the family: âI like being with dad, but I donât have any friends there.â Some say itâs okay to have a 50/50 arrangement, while others point out that their parents wish for such an arrangement is a problem for them: âIt is hard to share ourselves equally between parents. Everyday life is very busy, donât want 50/50.â The minority, who state that life is all right, that their parentsâ divorce is almost a good thing, relate this to, among other things, increased access to material things. The relationship breakdown can provide room for negotiation or an opportunity to make wishes come true. There are several examples of children asking the mediator to tell their parents that they would like a pet. One pair of siblings ask the mediator to tell the parents that they would like a dog. Two 10-year-old girls would ï¬rst like a budgie, then a dog at their mumâs and tropical ï¬sh at their dadâs. We do not know whether these are wishes the children have previously conveyed or whether they have arisen in relation to the family break-up. It could be that the children have registered sympathy and willingness to listen in the situation, something which might make it possible for wishes, which would previously not have been granted, to come true for the children."
252,125,0.965,The Ethics of Vaccination,"are clean? Notice that I am not arguing here against Brennanâs claim that vaccination should be compulsory, nor am I interested in how a libertarian could justify compulsory vaccination while remaining libertarian. Actually, I might even agree with Brennanâs claim that âthe libertarian must endorse something like the clean hands principle, and, further, must accept in some cases it is permissible to use coercion against the individuals who constitute the collective performing the rights violation or causing the harmâ (Brennan 2018, p. 42). Whether I would be prepared to endorse this claim depends on how we interpret the phrase âsomething like the clean hands principleâ. This phrasing is quite vague. What does it mean? Something like, but not exactly, the clean hands principle? If so, I agree with this quite vague formulation, although it is not a very informative one; my point is simply that the âclean handâ principle itself (not âsomething likeâ it) does not do the work Brennan wants it to do. One way to support the clean hand principle is simply dogmatic: keeping oneâs hands clean and not being moral accomplices of bad outcomes is good in and of itself, full stop. This is, for example, the approach that grounds the Catholic doctrine of the moral wrongness of formal cooperation in wrongdoing. Another possible approach could be considered deontological: getting oneâs hands dirty would violate some established ethical code. And there might be other ethical theories that can justify a moral obligation not to be accomplices in collective harms even when the individual contribution is negligible. Examples include contractualism (see, e.g., Giubilini et al. 2018), that is, roughly, the theory according to which we should act on the basis of principles that other people could not reasonably reject, or rule consequentialism, that is, the theory according to which everybody should follow those simple rules that, if followed by everyone else, would produce the best consequences, such as âbe vaccinatedâ. However, even if we want to accept any of these justifications (dogmatic, deontological, consequentialist, or contractualist) for the clean hand principle, they can hardly be taken to warrant the legal enforceability of a moral principle: some of them only concern the sphere of individual morality, and those that aim at informing policymaking (such as contractualism and perhaps some versions of rule consequentialism) require to commit to comprehensive moral theories that many people would not accept. In order to enforce a moral principle, the principle should ideally be one of those uncontroversially taken to have some relevance for policymaking, no matter what comprehensive moral theory one embraces."
46,17,0.965,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"children, in particular toddlers and newborns, compared to that of (some) animals. There is some philosophical debate about why we should treat such young children differently compared to bonobos or other apes, and this debate is centered on issues of rationality, autonomy and the ability to experience harm. We do not have a clear-cut answer and we also do not engage with this question in this book. Our premise is to say that human children have a moral status which implies that we should treat them with respect and be concerned about their well-being and well-becoming. We will later on explicate what this means in terms of responsibilities of different agents of justice towards children. Whether this moral status should also be applied to other non-human children is not our concern; we leave it to others to debate whether or not a just society would also require us to battle child poverty among non-human animals. Closely connected to that issue is the second question: the status of children not yet born. This question has two aspects, both of which are connected to a rich as well as controversial philosophical and political debate. On the one hand a society which wants to realize justice for all its children has to take a stance on abortion and also on what it owes to children during pregnancy. We also do not give a answer here, although we will briefly touch upon the issue that it can have harmful consequences if the mother is poor during pregnancy and that this health risk for the baby has to be taken seriously. It is a very delicate question whether or not the right answer here is mandatory prenatal care, based on evidence that being poor influences reproductive health and that girls living in poverty more often get pregnant (voluntarily and involuntarily) than their non-poor peers. On the other hand we focus in this book more or less exclusively on children already born, and we do engage with questions of intergenerational justice. Poverty reduction and alleviation, also during childhood, fight an injustice that should not exist from the start, and intergenerational justice is part of the larger question of how we can make sure that each and every child that is born is free of poverty. This book is organized in four chapters. Chapter 1 develops a concept of social justice for children. We will argue that the capability approach provides a good framework and discuss some issues that arise when applying this approach to children. Neither Sen nor Nussbaum have written much about children, how a capability-oriented concept of justice for children should be constructed and in what ways it differs from a concept for adults. The most important modification we want to make is to have a more dynamic understanding of functionings and capabilities, since childhood is a phase of development. Furthermore, an initial focus on achieved functionings seems advisable, since children"

This resulted in an increased intermingling of patients from different religious persuasions which bred religious and political tensions in the asylums. In 1901, an Enniscorthy paying patient, Edward S., was said to have an âaversion to Protestants, all of whom he regards as orangemen. Moore [an attendant] often hears him muttering when he passes, e.g. that if he had the chance he would do away with all âorangemenâ, and Protestantsâ. Edward also accused a fellow Roman Catholic inmate of becoming a Protestant to âget the privilegesâ, which Drapes interpreted as âbeing allowed to walk about on paroleâ. Edwardâs distaste towards Protestants extended beyond those in the patient population. Drapes, an active member of the Church of Ireland, also came under fire: âtold me more than once that it was my âbigotryâ which was keeping me here: and that it was I who got him sent hereâ.116 The extent to which religion was essential to patient identity is further indicated in the case of another Catholic paying patient at Enniscorthy, Lawrence D. In 1896, as part of a rather extensive campaign to avenge his wife, brother-in-law and former solicitor, whom he charged with wrongful confinement and forgery, Lawrence wrote to his parish priest, David Bolger. The letter is worth quoting from at length, as it is exemplary of religious preoccupations among not only paying patients, both also the Catholic clergy in Wexford: I will thank you to send me here a post office order for one pound, the amount I gave for a Baptismal Fee at the Baptism of my infant son Lawrence John: I had then more money than brains, and I have now more brains than money â¦ You did not think it worth your while or trouble to answer my letter of the 21st June, although you could lecture me in the jail of Wexford on the 30th July 1895 and tell me that it was a shame for me to employ a Protestant solicitor â¦ I replied that the last solicitor I employed was not even a Christian, he is a Jew â¦ I know now how a Catholic solicitor served me and he is now in the hands of the police â¦ I will tell you how a Protestant Nobleman, Lord Maurice Fitzgerald treated me. I wrote to him on the 23rd ult. and had his reply written from Johnstown Castle on the 27th July at one oâclock on the 28th.

299,29,0.965,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"members of one community or another, consider good behavior and we gently chastise them, it helps curbing such behavior. The same holds even on the international level. Nations hate to be criticized about the ways they deal with their citizens or with those of other nations, although there are sharp limits to how far they are willing to change their policies in order for these policies to be regarded as morally appropriate. Given the limited leverage moral voices have on the international level, I argue that we have to carefully select the targets of our moral voice. Chastising one regime after the other, for great and not so great violations of what we consider right, squanders whatever effect our moral voice can have. We need moral triage (see Chap. 11). Part V examines a few key ethical issues raised on the international level. The first centers on the American response to extremism in the Muslim world and asks how policymakers might better craft their messaging. Thus far, voices emanating from the USA have emphasized liberal values, like individual rights, democracy, and free markets, to counter religious extremist rhetoric. I argue that in doing so, we fail to recognize that while most of the Muslim world is not violent, the majority is also not liberal. They are believers who want to see religion play a greater role in public lifeâI call them âilliberal moderatesââand since they pose as central figures in the fight against violent extremism, we need to speak to them, I claim, on their terms (see Chap. 12). Part V then turns to the issues of mass atrocities and genocide. I followed these closely ever since a mutual friend introduced me to Samantha Power (who later became US ambassador to the UN during much of the Obama administration), as she was jogging on the banks of the Charles River. When she learned my name, she said with a broad smile, âI hate you!â It turned out that she was a journalist covering the brutal ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, calling in her story under fire to The Economist. She was told that her story had to be cut short to make room for a three-page story about communitarian ideas I was championing and which were, at the time, popular with Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. I soon read her Pulitzer Prize-winning volume A Problem from Hell in which she documents the history of Americaâs failure to respond to genocide and crimes against humanity. Bill Clinton, who did stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, stated that his biggest regret is that he did not in Rwanda (Hughes 2014). Indeed, more and more nations agreed that it was legitimate for foreign powers to interfere in the international affairs of nations if genocide took place. Part V examines how this moral consensus was abused and why the USA did so littleâdespite Powerâs urgingâto stop the civil war in Syria, the genocide in South Sudan, and the civil war in Libya. It is one of the great ethical questions of the ageâ as these atrocities continue (see Chap. 13). Senator John McCain made a compelling case for keeping the promotion of human rights as a core element of US foreign policy, but does not address the fact that while this goal is noble, the means may be foul. There is a vast moral and prudential difference between promoting human rights with nonlethal means (such as public diplomacy, leadership training, cultural exchanges, and even smart sanc-"

31,83,0.965,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"3. Posthumous pardoning has an important role in forgiveness and reconciliation. It forgives historical actors, as well as those emotionally affected by its decisions. Today, the shot at dawn campaign has been re-evaluated as a symbolic harm to the memory of the dead. This is complicated, not least because we should not conflate what was considered rightly just then, with what might no longer be considered just today. The most compelling reason to re-evaluate the past in the present is when it causes unnecessary and unjust suffering today. The symbolic and narrative redemption of reflexive biography has a way of conserving the fidelity of memory as well as having the redemptive effect of removing the human stain of inherited shame. For example, Harry Farrâs widow, Gertrude, struggled to cope after his death with a young daughter and no army pension. Gertrude and his daughter (also called Gertrude) unsuccessfully tried to clear Harry Farrâs reputation through the courts. The psychological burden of this failure was an intrinsic harmâalbeit of a secondary orderâto the relatives of the dead. Des Browneâs blanket pardonâwhich included Harry Farrâ could not have come any sooner for Harry Farrâs daughter Gertrude, who at the age of 93 lived to see her father forgiven. In her own words: âI am so relieved that this ordeal is over and that I can be content knowing that my fatherâs memory is intactâ (cited in Norton-Taylor 2006 [Authorâs Italics]). 4. It is a way of society understanding itself in relation to its past. By re-evaluating the past in the present we are acknowledging that what was considered wrong then is not something that we can view with the same disdain today. It signals to the world that while we understand why certain individuals were treated in the way they were, we can no longer view these people in the same way given what we know today. To really appreciate this perspective we need to think beyond the rather crude dichotomous reasoning which many historical commentators around this subject fall prey to when articulating a case for and against posthumous pardoning."

Our approach is markedly different in this respect from the one recommended by Markowitz (2016, 905), who writes that in authoritarian circumstances, interviewers âneed to be prepared to raise hard questions that bring tension into the room, to challenge informants when they are giving the official line and not their own viewpoint, and to identify discrepancies even to the point of calling him/ her out on a false statementâ. There are two elements to our stance. First, while we are obviously critical in many ways of the political systems we study, we do not arrogate to ourselves the right to prescribe to the locals how they could be improved.

Instead of creating one mind map for each user story, we started creating a single mind map for the entire module and updating it in every user story. These mind maps also included things common to the entire module like the visual specs or google analytics events that would be fired on specific actions. Figure 1 shows one our mind maps. This process was working fine, but I realized we had a problem: we were creating all these mind maps for every user story and modules and they were very useful while we were testing. But after that, they were stored in a folder and they were never used again. We understood that this was quite wasteful because we had so much valuable information being basically thrown away after the first utilization. Linking Everything. What I started doing was linking everything. At this point we had a mind map for each module but they were disconnected. So we created a ârootâ mind map that would reference all the different modules and pages we have in our application. Through this ârootâ mind map, anyone could access any mind map of any module in a few clicks. For some modules there were more levels of maps. In some cases we can have a module that has different implementations according to the sport we are in (e.g., market header for football, tennis, volleyball, etc.) and in those cases there will be a mind map"

[â¦] If he doesnât act, I will say to the patient, âIt took such a long time until your doctor came. Maybe you should consider taking another doctor who comes quicklyâ.

Sayaka, Tomoko, and Makoto argued that teaching all EFL classes in English would only be effective in helping students to improve their listening skills, and that the policy implementation would likely lower the quality of English education. Such negative attitudes toward the policy implementation were possibly born out of teachersâ negative feelings (i.e. disappointment and frustration) about the descrepancy between what was pledged and what was done by the politicians. Furthermore, Tomoko stated: I didnât tell you this last time [in the previous interview session]. I took a teacher employment exam this year, and I passed it â¦ My dream was to become a senior high school [English] teacher. I think I told you that. But, I took an exam for [prospective] junior high school [English] teachers â¦ Thatâs right! I gave up! Even though Tomokoâs initial intention was to become a senior high school English teacher, she changed her mind because of the new policy: âI couldnât imagine myself using English fluently to teach [English] classes, so I intentionally avoided aiming for a senior high school position.â Yet another type of resistance was observed. Sayaka, for instance, reported that she made a firm decision to continue using Japanese in her EFL classes. Sayaka also confessed that she had never even thought about using English to teach EFL classes, and that the percentage of time spent using her spoken English in class was âprobably close to zero.â 6.3.3 Teachersâ practical knowledge and lack of information-sharing Sayaka, Yuji, Tomoko, and Makoto demonstrated, though in different ways, their perception of the necessity to change their pedagogical approaches and teaching practices in senior high school settings. What they did not demonstrate was a consistent explanation of MEXTâs expectations for change. The need to incorporate communicative activities into EFL classes is clearly mentioned in the recent versions of The Course of Study, and the necessity to enrich the quality of communicative activities is similarly articulated in the latest version. Moreover, it is clear that MEXT is trying to generate a shift from traditional approaches (e.g. the teacher-centered, textbook-based grammar translation method) to student-centered, communicative approaches (cf. Stewart, 2009). As Nishino (2012) argues, this attempt appears to conflict with"

It creeps in, she says: in the beginning people might object, then you get accustomed and used to it, and thus accommodate this egoistic feeling. If we buy into Monaâs reasoning, it is valid to question if the centennial tax law as well as the rise of the sharing economy was a sign of the times; that it reflected a society where fewer and fewer people âcareâ about each other.

Her mourning over the loss (of her home) at times is so overwhelming that she does not feel strong enough to change anything for the better. While Aida expresses a strong nostalgia for pre-war Mostar, there is little she does to re-enact pre-war Mostar life in her daily practices, for example by making use of the entire city rather than restricting herself to the Bosniak-dominated part of it. Instead, she prefers to remain and to meet with people on the east side. Each time we met, and we met many times in the three years of my stay, she always proposed to do so somewhere on the east side. Only once did we cross sides because I had my children with me and suggested we visit the only proper playground in Mostar, located just across the Bulevar. When we arrived there, Aida immediately called one of her friends and told her that she was in the park for the first time after the war. Aidaâs case demonstrates that political loyalties do not necessarily make a difference in the way people move around Mostar and the motivations for not crossing are very diverse. For some it is a matter of insecurity or a lack of trust or even fear, others are restricted by their aim to conform and for yet others it is first and foremost an ideological decision (see Palmberger 2013). In Aidaâs case I suggest that her reluctance to visit places in West Mostar primarily has to do with the painful experience of loss of her pre-war home (which was located on that side of the city) and only to a lesser degree with conformity and with making a political statement."

What can you tell me about him? âNutcaseâ (pridurok). Thanks a lot, Gennady Viktorovich. (general director, p3) In this example the written testimonial was bypassed in favor of a personal recommendation which was not made public: unlike formal evaluations, informal ones are often made orally and the persons evaluated do not necessarily know about the contents of these assessments or even about their existence. Checking the background of the applicant over the phone was a common way of inquiring about the applicantâs character and competences. During one such conversation concerning an applicant, the advice given was âto chase him out with a broomâ (project leader, p24). However, informal recommendations were also evaluated critically and were cross-checked with different sources: If I see from the applicantâs CV that he worked in a particular firm, it is very important for me to be able to phone some acquaintance in this firm and ask how things are with this person. Why did he leave the firm, what he was unhappy with, what are his weak and strong points? It is of course very important to talk directly with the employee because the information received from a third party is not always objective. Thus one shouldnât blindly trust some recommendations but always communicate directly with the person in question. (technical director, p11) Moreover, neither good informal recommendations nor testimonials will secure a job if the candidate does not pass the formal tests required, for example, to land a programming job.

I have argued that persuasion does not involve any interference with autonomy and that nudging can involve interference with autonomy, but that when the latter does, the interference is not morally problematic. I now turn to examining a third possible strategy that, as I shall argue, is more restrictive than the two examined so far, in that it potentially implies some coercion for at least some individuals. This type of intervention is the provision of financial incentives, or conditional cash transfers (CCTs), for vaccinating oneself or oneâs children."
51,232,0.964,How Generations Remember,"After the children have organised themselves, a man rises to speak. He extends welcoming words, followed by a brief introduction of Äimba and his struggle against fascism. We learn that the German army entered Yugoslavia in 1941 and from this day until the liberation in 1945, 70 Partisan fighters received the honorary title narodni heroj (peopleâs hero), one of them being Äimba. During those four years, 800 soldiers gave their lives for Mostar and its people in order to obtain freedom, the speaker tells the audience. The youngest generation, he says, has to learn about Yugoslaviaâs history and must not forget it because today Mostar is again confronted with these ârootsâ of fascism. At the end of his rather lofty speech, a pupil lays a wreath before the bust. The next speaker is an elderly woman. She is small and wears her white hair unconventionally short. Although still agile, one can see by the wrinkles on her face that she has a long life behind her. I later discover that she is 84 years old and head of the local Partisan womenâs organisation. She begins her speech by loudly calling out the well-known Partisan slogan: Smrt faÅ¡izmu, sloboda narodu! (âDeath to fascism, freedom for the people!â), whereupon the children are urged to applaud. She continues that Äimba, like all the other soldiers, did not fight for his own benefit but for Bosnia and the entire Yugoslavia. Then she tells the pupils about life in Titoâs Yugoslavia where everyone lived together and people did not odmiksali (separate themselves, literally âde-mixingâ) like they do now. She stresses the importance of history and, while pacing slowly, step by step, she addresses the pupils: Step by step. We can learn what we have already learned. History can teach us.

118,581,0.964,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"nuclear energy, such as risk analysis, cost-benefit analysis, etc. How did we conduct this role? Was it sufficient? Or are there any other roles which we should perform for society? These are questions which we have to think about and find some answers. Iâm still convinced that the conventional role of nuclear professionals, providing information, is essential, since people need reliable, technical information to make decisions on nuclear policy and energy policy. But I also consider we have to be much more sensitive in our attitude towards the general public. Most technical information, such as simulations, calculations, or forecasts, contains some sort of uncertainties and assumptions which do not appear clearly when the outcomes are shown as numbers. Though some people are not accustomed to dealing with uncertainties or assumptions, we have to explain technical information, including uncertainties and assumptions, in a sincere and honest manner. Otherwise, information wonât be truly meaningful and we wonât be trusted in a real sense. In addition to the above conventional role, Iâm wondering if there are other roles which we should play. Since the culture of engineering is utilitarianism, our strongest assets and tools are based on a utilitarian way of thinking. But utilitarianism is not the only philosophy of modern society, especially in current Japan, and there are other major social values. Though Iâm not sure whether it is possible to justify use of nuclear energy without utilitarianism, it might be our role to facilitate discussions among people with different sets of values and to help them to bridge the gaps. At least, we have to understand various social values and gaps among them. The above are my thoughts on our role in society after Fukushima and I havenât yet reached any concrete conclusion. But at least, I have no doubt that we have to play a certain role in society and I consider we have to keep thinking about what our role is, not only with engineering methods but also with social scientific literacy."
315,254,0.964,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"ticipation in the survey. At the first contact by email or telephone, when we introduced the survey, we explained that we were interested in the participantsâ life story, that we wanted the participants to tell their story and that every single story is unique and interesting for us. When we met the participants again, we reminded them that we wanted them to share their experience with us. At the beginning and during the filling out the calendar, we encouraged the participants to speak about what they were writing (for example, âPlease donât hesitate to tell me things about the events you mention on the calendarâ) and asked questions during the fulfillment to invite the interviewees to speak (for example, the interviewer would look at the calendar and say: âSo, I see that you travelled for one year between high school and university.â The interviewee may reply: âYes, I wanted to have a break because â¦â). Finally, the main purpose of the in-depth biographical interview was to produce the life story, so we encouraged the participants to tell their story by asking open-ended questions (for example, âCan you tell me your memories of your educational path, from the first day until the end/today?) and using relaunch questions to obtain more precise information on a specific event or period (for example, âYou told me you chose to do a tinsmith apprenticeship. What made you go down this road?â). The use of this strategy was effective in about 6 cases out of 10. Thus, while recording, we obtained first some comments and narrative development during the filling out of the calendar and then a life story constructed by the interviewee and stimulated by the questions relaunched by the interviewer. In some cases (3 of 10 participants), the interviewees did not speak much during the fulfillment of the calendar, despite the discursive incentives of the first strategy. They answered with short sentences and did not go into details. In this case, we set up a second strategy, which was to clearly distinguish the two parts of the participation: the calendar and the in-depth biographical interview. When we finished the calendar, we provided a break and explained that we were beginning a new part of the study. We helped the participants to clearly see the difference between the two dynamics (writing and commenting during the fulfillment of the calendar and talking freely during the in-depth interview) by stating, âYou completed the calendar. You can leave it on the table so you can look at it if you need to and eventually complete or correct it. Now, we will begin another part of the survey, I would like you to tell me your story, your path, your life experience. To begin, I have one question â¦â This strategy helped the participants to speak freely but it was not guaranteed. In fact, some of the participants did not speak easily, as they were shy or did not like to share their experience. In another cases, participants began to tell their life story during the filling out of the calendar. Generally, the participants began speaking about one dimension of their life related to the column they were filling out. In this case, our third strategy was to maintain and encourage the narration. We did not stop the story; on the contrary, we supported it with follow-up questions and then continued onto other topics. In short, we reversed the procedure and took full advantage of the voluntary development of the life story to go back later to the fulfillment of the calendar. Such cases were rare but advantageous for the interviewer, who only needed to orient the narrative toward the topics of interest."
332,4,0.964,"Media Resistance : Protest, Dislike, Abstention","I would customarily refute claims that television was bad, being more interested in the actual operations of television institutions in society. Then two things happened that (re-)kindled my interest in media resistance. I became dean of a diverse humanities faculty in the 2000s and experienced ï¬rst-hand the deep ambivalence many in the humanities feel towards the media and media studies. There was still a sense that mass media objects were not worthy of academic attention, and that the discipline was slightly suspect, too celebratory and getting too much attention. The second thing that happened was social media. After an initial warm welcome, online and social media began to provoke diverse expressions of resistance. In the 2010s, complaints began to pop up in conversations that reminded me of the anti-television stance of my childhood. As statements and confessionals about invasive media proliferated, the labels customarily used by media scholars and liberals to describe media resistance, of âmedia panicâ and âtechnophobiaâ did not really seem to ï¬t. In an era of ubiquitous media, it seems like we all need a measure of resistance, or at least a strategy for self-regulation, to keep our engagement with media in check. And so the tables keep turning. I have written this book because I am curious about those who resist, and how media resistance is sustained as a powerful presence in our culture. I have also written it because I believe that media studies should devote more attention to expressions and acts of resistance, how they connect, persist and change."

14,308,0.964,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"In addition, the children themselves said they did not care about skin colours in their school. Therefore, on the surface, it appeared that skin colour was not an issue. However, observation of various events, one of which I will present below, challenges the assertion of colour-blindness (see also Seeberg 2003). As part of the ï¬eldwork, I was with the children in a gym and saw Robert lying on the floor, apparently very upset. It turned out that Adine had called him âniggerâ (svarting, lit. âblackieâ). Both Adine and Robertâs families come from Africa. Adineâs family is from Morocco, while Robertâs parents come from South Africa. Adine called Robert svarting for no apparent reason; they were not quarrelling or ï¬ghting. Her use of the derogatory word may contradict the teacherâs assertion that the students used racial terms only in cases of conflict. The term angered the other boys in the gym. They started whispering excitedly and soon a loud, uniï¬ed, aggressively repetitive âRacist, racist, racist!â was heard throughout the gym. The boys, led by Abdullah, approached Adine. She tried to hide behind me while I was trying to calm the angry boys down: âStop, stop, donât make a fuss out of this, just leave it!â âBut, listen, she is a racist!â they insisted. I told them to calm down and continue with their games, because I considered this an issue to be dealt with by the teacher, not by a researcher doing ï¬eldwork. The above event indicates that skin colour did have importance in their everyday life. This is supported by a comment made by Lisa, the teacher, who asserted, âAfricans, they are black, they are labelled blacks, they can be called that by Pakistanis, who are labelled brown.â It is my impression that the label âblackâ is more an expression of serious insult, as in the situation with Adine above, than the âbrownâ label. âBrownâ is more of a descriptive classiï¬catory term and it is not part of a legacy of racist terminology in the same way as âblack.â These colour distinctions may be interpreted as an indication of racialized ethnic hegemony and are also indications of a contested childhood. At Dal school, this hegemony is represented by (light) brown-skinned Asians, for instance the majority group of Pakistanis, together with ethnic Norwegians. This example indicates that skin colour is important for identity construction among the studied children. The following conversation between Nasreen and Saira, two girls whose families are from Pakistan, further attests to this hypothesis: Mari: I suppose you often get the question: where are you from? Nasreen: They see it by the way we look! But people can mix up whether we come from India, Bangladesh, Pakistanâ¦ People can see whether you are Norwegian by the way you dress, they dress in âshortâ clothesâ¦[to be discussed later]. Saira: Because we donât have different skin colour [the nationalities just mentioned]. Mari: But what do you think yourself, you are born in Norway, go to a Norwegian schoolâ¦"

It is also important to note a word of caution too though, summarised by one respondent who remarked: âFound them quite interesting. Collaborative text editor had lower quality in contrast to GDoc, surely I would not use itâ. In relation to the question: âWere you able to find suitable widgets for building your PLE during the second workshop activity?â there was almost unanimous response in the second workshop alluding to the intermittent internet issues that appeared to plague the entire session. One quote, perhaps, sums up the frustration that most participants felt dominated, their experiences: âInternet connection issues did not let us perform this activityâ. Nonetheless, 90 % of the same participants responded positively to the next question: âDid you find the workshop activities useful for your research needs and goals?â which can be summarised by one remark: âI found it an interesting approach to be tested in the futureâ. One respondent did, however, offer a rather more circumspect response: âI do not know. I have to check those pages more when I come homeâ. Opinions from both the workshopsâ attendees about widget-based PLEs were, in general terms, evenly spread. One notable exception, however, was the response from workshop 2: âI would find interacting with a PLE requires a lot of my mental effortâ. Nonetheless, the respondents overwhelmingly recorded that they were neutral in their feelings about this statement for the second workshop. Research students in the first workshop appeared to be more discerning in their learning and, as noted by the ROLE presenter, the majority of the students appeared to focus on the Binocs widget rather than the ObjectSpot widget. Again this seemed to colour their view of the overall experience of using the ROLE technology."

I evinced interest in hooking up the plumbing, so to speak. And the next day they came and took the dark room out. TM: Where was your office at Pitt initially? NB: We were in the Schenley Hall. Pitt bought the Schenley Hotel and we were on the seventh floor and every office had a bathroom, a hotel bathroom. Which was terrific, because you didnât have to waste time going down the hall. My first person on the other end of the bathroom was Storrs McCall, and we worked together a lot, we had a lot of fun. TM: So that was the time when the department was really building up to become the strong department that it then became. NB: I neglected to mention Kurt Baier. TM: He was there already? NB: Yes, he was. He came a couple of years after Nick and Adolf, but before I came by a year or two. And he was chairman. A wonderful chairman he was. You hardly knew he was chairing. We had meetings in the hall. âYeah, thatâs a good idea, letâs do it.â Not bureaucratic like it is today. And his wife Annetteâthose were bad times for females. She was treated very poorly for a long, long time. She got some low class employment at Carnegie Mellon University for a while, and then finally Pitt hired her back on a proper professorship. And then she thrived. TM: How close were the ties with CMU doing all these years? NB: Theyâve gradually gotten closer. But they were close even then, there was a lot of back and forth. TM: Itâs fortunate to have these two institutions so close together. I can see that with Kohei Kishida, for example, how well it worked out. NB: Wonderful."

The big challenge is to follow the development while at the same time not becoming too similar. I do not really think so because there are certain things that make us uniqueâ (Interview, staff member, nonproï¬t school, Denmark). In Norway, competition between public and nonproï¬t schools is an unfamiliar concept. Families choose nonproï¬t schools primarily because they give them services better suited to their preferences. Interestingly, although some parents expressed discontent with public schools, none used the exit option as a tool for obtaining change at their former public schools. Moreover, headmasters at the schools did not regard the threat of exit as a potential instrument for students to obtain changes. One headmaster at a public school pointed out that they tried to keep their students and would accommodate them to avoid changes, but that it was to a certain degree unavoidable. At the same time, more students enter the school than leave it, as the headmaster observes: âIt is not always we get star students, to speak plainly. Often there is âsomethingâ when you change schoolâ (Interview, site manager, public school, Norway). This suggests that often it is the weaker, more demanding students who change schools, especially when the change is between public schools, since these families do not seek distinctiveness or wish to opt out of public school. Since these students demand many resources, it might not be beneï¬cial for schools to attract them in the ï¬rst place. Information is pivotal for parents to make an active choice when choosing schools and making use of the alternatives they have. Differences in this sense reflect the tradition of school types in the"
50,6,0.963,"Seeing Ourselves Through Technology : How We Use Selfies, Blogs and Wearable Devices To See and Shape Ourselves","In 1524 Parmigianino painted his Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. Parmigianino used oil paints to paint on the hollow inside of half a wooden ball, to mimic the shape of the mirror he copied his reflection from. The distortions of the convex mirror are exactly replicated in Parmigianinoâs self-portrait. His hand is in the foreground, grossly distorted by the fisheye perspective of the convex mirror he is looking into to see himself. We can just see the short pencil he is holding to sketch his own image. We see what he sees. Parmigianino used a convex mirror to see himself; today we use digital technologies. We snap selfies on our phones and post them to Instagram. We write about our lives in blogs and in status updates to Facebook. We wear activity trackers on our wrists, log our productivity and allow Facebook and other apps to track our locations continuously. The data we track is displayed back to us as graphs, maps, progress charts and timelines. Parmigianinoâs self-portrait may not seem to have much in common with a FitBit userâs charts of steps and sleep patterns, but both are examples of how technology is a means to see part of ourselves. Whether we use a wearable, networked step-counter or a convex mirror and oil paints, technology can reflect back to us a version of who we are. And the data, filters and social media we use to see and share our reflections distort our images in their own particular ways, just as Parmigianinoâs convex mirror distorted the perspective of his face. With digital cameras, smart phones and social media it is easier to create and share our self-representations. But self-representations have always been part of our culture. We have drawn, carved, sculpted and painted images of ourselves for millennia; we have kept diaries, scrapbooks and photo albums; we have sung ballads and told stories about ourselves. Sometimes we use the mediation of technology to help us see ourselves better, to understand ourselves or to improve ourselves, or simply to imagine someone to speak to, a âdear diaryâ to tell our secrets to when nobody else will listen. Other times we want to share our experiences with others. We paste photos and memorabilia into a photo album to share with family and imagine one day passing it down to our children and their children. Some of us write autobiographies or memoirs to be published for a wider audience. This book explores the ways in which we represent ourselves today through digital technologies. Like Parmigianino, we create visual selfportraits and share them.

21,155,0.963,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"we also experimented with more complex changes, such as giving characters different levels of friendship, and creating sensors and actions that made it possible for agents to alter and respond to these levels. We worked to make these almost as simple to use as those for shooting and being shot, and we rearranged the menus so that they were at the same level. We created new curricula, introducing Kodu in new ways, and new sample games, emphasizing our new sensors and actions. We did all this in the context of talking with early teens from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds, and we ran after-school programs in a variety of middle schools, using versions of Kodu iterated between each program. What we found, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that by the end we were seeing a much wider variety of games. There were more types of play, and a broader range of subject matters. In fact, what we eventually found was that Koduâs visual polishâan important part of its initial appealâbecame one of the barriers. Its models and animations were created for a system that made shooting and racing gameplay easy. When teens started considering making a broader set of games, they saw a mismatch between their potential game systems and the ways the games could appear on screen. But in a sense, when teens observed this it was also positive. It was the beginning of a critique of the assumptions built into Koduâs available elements, opened by shifting the available rules without shifting the data. To my knowledge, what we did with Kodu has not been done with any other tool. Current tools and ideas may aim to broaden understanding of computing, they may focus on computational media literacy, and they may embody lessons learned from media making. But they are divorced from critical thinking about their representationsâfrom point of view, from politics. They havenât been critiqued regarding the way their technical specifics connect to ideas of the world, much less reshaped in response to critique. When this is how we do work in our field, we run a significant risk. We run the risk that all these well-intentioned projects end up solving precisely the wrong problem. Nelson did not say that we can and must understand computers because the IT sector (or the surveillance state, or Walmart) has an urgent need for more computingliterate worker bees. Nelsonâs challenge is only answered if we educate people who are prepared to disrupt business as usualâand to invent the broad, thoughtful media of the future."

In fact, the findings show that ICTs may serve to exacerbate or amplify the menâs burdens, calling into question the empowerment thesis. The new communications technology, while a blessing in some ways, makes it easier for left behind relatives to âexploitâ family connections for money and other forms of remittance. Saleem, in particular, returned again and again during our discussions to the motif of exploitation, both in France and back home. I donât feel at ease, because I feel that â I feel I am alone, and I am still exploited â exploited by those who are here [in France] and those who are there [back home] (â¦) Itâs true that itâs my family, but Iâm exploited all the same, because I donât have a choice.

117,161,0.963,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"residents who do not want the same as themselves in activities of daily living (ADL) care encounters âdifficultâ or exhibiting âchallenging behaviourâ (e.g. Higgs and Gilleard 2015, pp. 89â90). But they frequently stop short at unpacking how this encounter plays out when it presents itself. To want something is an expression of subjectivity, and being respected in oneâs desires is as much part of living a good life in a dementia care home as it is elsewhere. But how can we think about what residents want in cases which lead their care workers to assert that what a resident wants is not good for her? Indeed, if care were just about âgetting the job doneâ then the way it is done would not be relevant. In practice, however, this clearly matters. As care worker Cici remarked: âAs a normal human being you do not want to be forced all the time!â Similarly, one may not want to be left to oneâs fate all alone either. Indeed, there is a lot in between. This is not to say that coercion or neglect never happens in care work. When Ms Lichthart woke up covered in her own faeces, but was nevertheless resisting a shower, two care workers held her in a tight grip while another washed her quickly. It seemed âthe only way to do thisâ. Ms Lichthart indeed needed a shower, but by washing her this way, what she wanted was overruled. Yet, rather than concluding that âthings are not going well in careâ because these situations do occur, I want to emphasise here that such generalisations about care work miss something: they miss the work that care workers do on a daily basis to prevent these extreme measures. This work becomes most visible in situations in which what a resident wants is opposed to what a care worker wants. Debates on the will are an obvious starting point to take a closer look at these situations. Thinking about the will has long been the domain of philosophers. In the most general sense, philosophers have understood the will as the ââfaculty, or set of abilities, that yields the mental events involved in volitionâ, where volition is understood to be âa mental event in the initiation of actionââ (Brand 1995, p. 843 in Murphy and Throop 2010, p. 7). Debates on the topic have focused on the (in)compatibility of relative freedom and determinacy of human choice and action. Within these debates, moral philosophers attach particular value to the free will. After all, whether, or to what extent, we can act freely informs whether we have a choice to act in a good or bad way in the first place. Put differently, without a will that is free (at least to some degree), moral decision making is not possible."
161,88,0.963,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"Some rural women in this study purchased mobile phones with money saved through arisan saving-and-loan scheme, while others use their own savings to purchase cheap mobile phones at the market. Some rural women in these villages are still practicing a traditional saving method by keeping their money inside a small envelope or in a wooden box, which they keep in a safe place at home. Some of the older women participants were bought mobile phones by their children. As mentioned, the phones enabled them to stay connected with their family members (i.e., husband, children, and grandchildren), fellow traders, friends, and also with mantri. While the women perceived doctors as socially higher than them, and therefore they feel sungkan (Javanese respectful behavior that means feeling of shame without the feeling of doing something wrong) to call or text them, they perceived mantri as part of their family. They felt they could contact mantri whenever they needed his help or advice. âI usually visit my patients one by oneâ¦riding this motorbike, going around the villages,â mantri explained. Living in the same neighborhood as the women, mantri and his family are considered as kin. Regardless of their resource-poor conditions, these women highly appreciated the âinner peaceâ (ketenangan batin) that a mobile phone brought to their life. Samsiah said: I donât really need a mobile phone, but one day I was very sick. I donât know why, but I felt weak and suddenly collapsed. When I woke up, I was already in the hospital. Pak mantri told me, âAlhamdulillah (Thank God) my wife was already at your door when your sister cried out for help.â After I recovered, my son got me a used phoneâ¦He told me, âMak (mom), just in case. Pak mantri can check on you. If you refuse [to take the phone], I wonât let you go to the market againâ Well, itâs hard for me to use it at ï¬rst, but I feel ayem (peace).

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"This incident taught me to be much more patient in my approach to hostel residents and to explain more fully what I was doing. I also learned that getting consent was not a one-time event to be crossed off a checklist, but rather a task to be repeated throughout the research stages. This is what Cutcliffe and Ramcharan (2002) mean when they use the term âethics as processâ (cited in Liamputtong 2007: 43-4). Their insight is that ethical issues evolve as research progresses and greater depth of experience and involvement is achieved. In such situations, consent needs to be renegotiated every so often. The difficulty in securing informed consent also had a bearing in who participated in my study. A number of the older men in the hostel with whom I established some rapport appeared to suffer from mental health problems. Securing informed consent would have been highly problematic and dubious in these cases. Other individuals were in a state of physical ill health that led them to decline my invitation to participate. And of course, there was also the issue of language proficiency.

13,94,0.963,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"but the social patterns to which they speak that is the target (Roseneil 2006: 848). In my case, the whole-sample analysis does not work on the level of individual psychobiographies, but on the level of shared psychological patterns. It is not the defended subjects I am aiming at, but rather the patterns of defence across individual cases, no matter how varied the individual trajectories to this pattern were. Furthermore, the concept of the unconscious I work with is not only or even primarily understood with reference to the dynamically repressed, but rather as a part of the self that organises experience and informs creativity and agency on an emotional level (see Chap. 2). For this reason I relate to my interview transcripts not as persons, but as texts. I regard the interviews as a corpus of text in which I try to find the emotional meaning as an integrated part of what is said, directly or indirectly. Just as narrative perspectives open up âoutwardsâ to social change, they also open up âinwardsâ through conveying the emotional meanings attached to such change (Rudberg and Nielsen 2011). It is possible to work with a psychoanalytic ontology (Hollway and Jefferson 2000; Roseneil 2006) and to employ a context-sensitive textual analysis and a psychologically sensitive reading that acknowledge that an emotional meaning is always present in what is said, without analysing individual unconscious conflicts. From the way the informants talk and the words they use, it is possible to learn something about their personal images of parents and thus to gain some insight into how also emotional aspects of meanings of gender are part of a personâs biography. I have found the psychoanalytic concepts of identification, disidentification, projection, disavowal, idealisation and ambivalence (see Chap. 2) useful as ways to interpret what the informants say about their relationships with others and their own bodies. They may work as âsmall pockets of feelingsâ in the text. What people say about their feelings is sometimes relatively straightforward, while at other times it may be more hidden or ambiguous. The relation between utterance and textual context is an important cue here. If an informant says âI had a good relationship with my motherâ and then proceeds to describe her relationship with her father with much more enthusiasm and detail, then this textual context lends significance to the claim. Another informant could utter exactly the same phrase, but the context of the interview could give it a different meaning"

This is happening to such an extent that today, a majority of people are unable to see the death of nature and fail to remember a basic fact of humanity that was immortalised in a poem by Sadi, a 13th-century Iranian poet. Sadi wrote that âall men are members of the same body, created from one essence. If fate brings suffering to one member, the other cannot stay at rest. You who remain indifferent to the burden of the pain of others do not deserve to be called humanâ (Arberry 1945). Before it is too late, before the principle of dichotomy, which functions as a despotic, stubborn, obstinate principle, comes to dominate all life, return to tawheed and ï¬nd your true dignity. The destruction from lack of tawheed and true dignity touched my life personally (writes Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr, co-author of this book). When Iraq attacked Iran in 1980, and I had to defend the country with an army that was nearly dismantled, I hoped to be killed many times rather than see the country overrun by the Iraqi army. I wished I had been killed when my helicopter crashed, and not seen those days. However, because of my belief in life and dignity, I came to my senses and was ï¬lled with belief. I reproached myself for my death wish and found a solution by reminding myself of the dignity, courage, and ability of Iranian soldiers and ofï¬cers. Astonishingly, despite the general belief that Iran would be defeated, not only was Iran not overrun by the Iraqi army, but the destiny of the war was changed in its ï¬rst months. Therefore, I am well aware that it is hard to resist power in the search for dignity. However, by resisting these passing sentiments, one can transform them into eternity."
381,144,0.963,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"The Importance of Title I Background Title I has a historical importance as the program that led the way in federal efforts to improve educational opportunity. It has generated an ocean of research papers and policy arguments about whether to continue, improve, or abolish the program. Within the research and policy fields there is little consensus on how to interpret test scores such as NAEP in relation to Title I, and little consensus about what would constitute success (eliminating test score gaps across groups, reducing them, or keeping them from getting worse). The program is widely criticized despite increasing scores and slightly declining gaps between race-ethnic groups and decades of solid bipartisan support for the general idea of Title I. Part of the dominance of Title I in such discussions has to do with the attraction to test scores and Title Iâs linkage to NAEP. Journalists follow suit, highlighting these test scores, although whether the emphasis on scores is appropriate is an open question. In contrast, consider the field of special education. Although special educationâs budget exceeds Title I in most districts, and federal support for it now rivals Title I, it does not have a simple annual set of achievement scores to report and receives less notice. Some critics say that Title I has failed to close the achievement gaps. They also say there is no proof Title I is responsible for the modest narrowing of gaps in the test scores by race-ethnicity because NAEP does not actually identify Title I kids. Therefore, some say, Title I should be discontinued. Thus, Title I is an important topic; it would be an enormous decision to discontinue this durable but plagued symbol of the nationâs commitment to improving the education of the children of poverty."

Do they still function, does blat exist nowadays? P4: In state structures it stays as it was. In my opinion there is no doubt about this. But in business â this is a complex question. It is clear that parents try to push their children forward through all means. This is a normal parental instinct, and here blat functions. Another matter is that it functions precisely as an exchange of favors. I have an example in mind, where a big boss arranged for his children to work in different companies. With this it happens often that the child does not correspond to the requirements presented by the companies. But the child was employed precisely because dad had given in one way or another a favor to this company. And so this happened in full scale. As for business, I think that in big companies this also functions, but not in small ones. Here I doubt it. Q: Why? P4: In small companies people are visible (na vidu), everything is counted and the budget is small. If a small company has to employ someone to win a state organized tender, this causes a financial calculation: How much do we lose by employing this kid and how much do we win by getting this order. (general director, p4) In all, despite the significant changes compared to Soviet-era blat, the present-day Russian society and economy still seem to leave room for informal practices more or less reminiscent of blat. Even though these practices may be neither as pervasive nor culturally specific as in the Soviet Union, they still continue to exist, particularly in the public sector and state-controlled parts of the economy."

So everybody knew everybody and we discussed our research with everybody else. I had the good fortune to be assigned an office next door to Rolfâs, and luckily, fortuitously, even in later years we have always had offices side by side, so we have been in very close contact. I had been working myself on statistical reactions in nuclear physics, and in particular on compound nuclei and related topics, and it was of course interesting to see what this could mean in particle physics. I knew before I arrived about Hagedorn, at least vaguely. Once at CERN I quickly wanted to know what Rolf Hagedorn was up to. I immediately found out that he was a true strong interaction manâI recall that when I first went to his office, I did not look at his door. I just knocked and stepped inâ ignoring a huge sign on the door saying âNe pas dÃ©rangerâââDo not disturbâ! I did not know that Rolf had the habit of taking a nap for an hour or so at noon, and I just barged in there. As you can imagine, there was a pretty strong interaction! I was a newly arrived, fresh postdoc, while he was a staff member fast asleep. But ever since I only had very pleasant interactions with Rolf. What was the Theory Division at this time?

There was one important fixture of the Theory Division through all the years, our beloved Tatiana FabergÃ©, see Fig. 1.4. She was already then running the TH-division, and has done it ever since, independent of whoever happened to be the division leader. The late LÃ©on Van Hove came to take up the leadership of the Theory Division on nearly the same day I arrived and he was already a major physics figure. He had been on and off at CERN before, but that was about the time he started to take care of us. He is unfortunately no longer with us, but his wife Jenny is here. I am very happy about that, since LÃ©on was a very old and dear friend of Rolfâs."

Our Iran expert by contrast, who has also interviewed activists, has taught himself to routinely use encryption. When he first started doing research in 2008, he had concerns about his transcripts getting physically impounded. However, he did not know much about Internet surveillance at the time, and he would simply e-mail his transcripts to his partner back home before erasing them. In 2015, he erased all data from his laptop before traveling to Iran. Less sensitive interviews he kept on his laptop, a bit hidden away with nondescript file names, more sensitive ones he would encrypt. Some of us never record interviews but rely exclusively on extensive notes. Notes, they say, can have the advantage of making respondents more comfortable but also of making the interviewer more attentive to what she is hearing. Others do use recordings, but not for the most sensitive issues. All of us make copious notes, often in a mix of languages and even scripts, which are not readily intelligible to others. In case of extremely sensitive confidential information, we sometimes write nothing down at all but try to commit it to memory. There is an obvious tension here, which we will revisit in Chap. 6, between accuracy and transparency on the one hand, and protecting ourselves and our respondents on the other hand. We went through a learning curve, from having little awareness of data security issues to assuming that rigorous measures like the use of offline laptops and encryption provide the most safety to thinking in terms of trade-offs between greater digital security on the one hand and the risks of arousing suspicion, physical theft, or becoming caught up in paranoia on the other hand. Our general experience has been that it is worthwhile to learn and practice a range of digital security routines before going into the field, so that we know how to use them if we find that the context requires it. If we then find that the routines we had envisaged are unnecessary or even inappropriate, we can relax or abandon them. The other way around, ratcheting up oneâs digital security routines once in the field, could be technically and practically much more difficult."

Third, is this, or can this be, the beginning of a new paradigm that bridges media and social theory?"

Often it seems that we are only one step away from building such machines. However, despite of a long research in the field it is not the case. We may be able to build highly sophisticated robotic bodies or, theoretically, a complex intelligent system controlling the actions of a robot but so far we have failed to make the robot perform some tasks we people consider very basic. For example, our robots cannot see as we do. We did not build a robust, multipurpose system giving a robot the ability to visually recognize objects in its environment - yet. Humans (indeed many animals) do it easily thanks to their highly developed brains. Learning what the environment consists of is the first step in the development of an intelligent behavior. Jeff Hawkins has explained a memory-prediction theory of brain function in 2004 [1]. This theory was among the first that provided unified a unified basis for thinking about the adaptive control of complex behavior and it is in the"

On the lighter side, we recall that only when MÃ¼nchhausen has yanked very strongly at his hair, was he able to move, and then not only himself, but taking with him the swamp, and the Earthâthe whole world. (c) It is noteworthy that in the realm of todayâs particle physics (or High Energy Physicsâwe have seen that these two terms mean the same) no evidence is found that the existing principles of relativity and of quantum theory need to be corrected or extended in any way; even though we are in a new situation. (d) After my report, it might seem as if the end of elementary particle physics has come. However, what I have presented arises from speculative hypothesis. And even if everything were correct, we would not come to an end, but find ourselves at a new beginning: in all the above considerations only strong interactions were considered, and not in terms of particular form of forces, but only in terms of the ever-changing composition of the âelementary particles,â and we have never spoken about their individual characteristicsâtherefore our conclusions were completely independent of all these additional known particle properties. Thus we have described the average behavior, the statistical behavior. But the main focus of high energy physics is precisely on all these more detailed individual properties of the new particles and the forces acting between them. And there is the question, why these forces? In this regard we stand at a new beginning. (e) Many physicists still believe in the possibility of exploring deeper and further to ever more elementary building blocks. One must follow this line experimentally and cannot be misled by intellectually satisfying speculation into believing that the scientific question is settled. (f) I have tried to describe everything in everyday language, in words, that we physicists use, when we talk about such things at tea. To you, the reader, everything must look very mysterious, especially the claim that each âelementary particleâ in different ways has been created from all the others. Take it to be âasif-speechâ, as a blurry image of what can be formulated much more precisely with the help of mathematics or technical jargon.

186,47,0.962,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"something one can aspire to that could lead to a laurel, as in Goetheâs poem, if achieved. It is not something intrinsic in humankind, as the German constitution, via the earlier riddle, assumes. If somebody from a culture that does not have a word for dignity is learning English, would the above help her understand the concept? In some respects yes. She would probably come to the conclusion that, in most cases, authors use the term as a descriptive property. Among other things, characters can be humble, modest, pleasant, charming, plain, lazy, mean, vicious, aggressive, serene, andâdigniï¬ed. They can demonstrate intelligence, beauty, arrogance, pride, languor, humility andâdignity. In almost all of the quotes above, one learns something about particular human beings that sets them apart from others; some show dignity, others do not. If dignity were an inherent property of all human beings, it would have no useful meaning in ï¬ction. No author would use it to describe their characters, as it would not set them apart from others. The phrase âa digniï¬ed old ladyâ would be identical in meaning to the phrase âan old ladyâ. This is clearly not the case. Bertolt Brechtâs short story âDie unwuerdige Greisinâ,5 about an allegedly undigniï¬ed old lady, would not make sense. Hence, in ï¬ction and poetry, dignity is a useful descriptor precisely because some people display it and others do not. Judged from its use in the above quotes alone, dignity would seem to be a property that is not inherent in all human beings; it can be seen and recognised, but not all humans possess it. Therefore dignity does not seem to be inviolable and intrinsic. Its presentation in the quotations above comes down ï¬rmly on the side of the ï¬rst riddle. Of course, the selection of excerpts might have been highly selective, designed to give that impressionâand besides, these quotations are too few to represent the breadth required for the blanket conclusions to be drawn. But one can say that in ï¬ction, at least sometimes, dignity is used as a descriptive property which sets people apart, as opposed to a property that applies universally to humankind. The following two excerpts show the use of dignity in ï¬ction in a much broader way than in the earlier examples. I found a run-down cafÃ©. â¦ I sat there for an hour. I thought that somewhere in the universe must lie the other world â¦ a sun-golden world, a digniï¬ed world. Where every human found the one meant for them, where every love was true love and where one lived eternally. And, of course, I immediately thought of those who could not live even there; who were not suited for such generous, sumptuous grace. The damned, who would take their own lives even there.

Recurrent topics of concern are aggression/violence, big conï¬icts and parentsâ alcohol and drug use. One 13-year-old boy asks the mediator to convey the following message to his parents: âI do not want dad to be drunk when I am at his house.â The statement from two siblings aged 13 and 15 was: âDad should not drink alcohol when we are there. We want to continue to spend time with dad as long as he doesnât drink.â Another pair of siblings say they are willing to try the arrangement whereby they spend one week with each parent, but then dad has to stop drinking and he has to learn how to deal with the medication for the childâs condition. Some children describe very concretely what does not work, and also suggest possible solutions. Two youths ask the mediator to tell the parents the following: âWe want to have a nice childhood until we are 18. We want to live with our uncle for an indeï¬nite period. If not with our uncle, then our choice would be with dad. To mum: Stop lying. Get rid of your druggie friends and prioritise your family. Quit making us feel guilty. Stop slagging dad off. We want to have contact with our parents, especially with dad. Mum can visit us at dadâs, but she mustnât say bad things about our father.â Others are clear about what they want, but it is not always that obvious why they want it. One 11-year-old girl wants the mediator to tell her parents that she is really quite OK with mum, and she does not want to stay the night with dad: âI only want to meet him during the day, and not at his house.â Another child says: âI want to live with mum. I donât trust my dad. I do not want to have any contact with dad AT THE MOMENT.â These children direct the attention directly and indirectly to parents who do not sufï¬ciently look after their childrenâs needs/provide sufï¬cient care for their children. In the worst scenario, this describes parents from whom the children need protection. In rare cases this is about poor care from both parents, however, several cases concern worry or insecurity when the children are with one of the parents.

We have decided to present our results in the form of lecture notes. There are several reasons for this choice. First, we strongly believe that the theory described above is very useful, and we want to help make it as comprehensible as possible. That is more or less impossible to do in scientific papers because their focus must be on new results and not on careful derivations of established insights. A second reason is that the problem of understanding cell physiology and how drugs affect their function is inherently multidisciplinary, and we therefore write these notes in such a way that we hope readers who are not primarily applied mathematicians can understand. We also hope to give applied mathematicians glimpses of interesting problems of great importance. As mentioned above, these notes aim to explain known theory that we think can be useful to researchers working on a mathematical understanding of living cells. There are also new results. We show in some detail how to derive formulas describing the optimal properties of theoretical drugs. Most of the results are stated for rather simple models, but it is quite clear that the methods can be extended to more intricate cases. The million dollar question when you read these notes is, of course, can these drugs actually be created? Do they exist? We do not know. We know that Markov models have been used to successfully represent the actions of drugs, but is it possible to go the other way and first compute what properties the drug should have and then create it? We have found no clear answers in the literature or through discussions with colleagues, so we decided to just formulate these ideas as precisely as possible in the hopes that someone will find them useful. We have tried to carefully underline in the notes that we are discussing theoretical drugs, and we state in many places that this work is about possible drugs."
252,17,0.962,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Western, developed countries. These include the MMR, influenza, pertussis, â6-in-1â (which contains vaccines against six different infectious diseases, including polio), pneumococcal, and rotavirus vaccines (for a list, see, e.g., NHS 2016). Also, as my analysis of the ethics of vaccination unfolds in the next chapters, it will become clear that my arguments only apply to those vaccines that protect against communicable infectious disease and therefore not to vaccines against any infectious disease. For example, the ethical considerations I will make do not apply to the vaccine against tetanus, which is not a communicable disease (although the tetanus vaccine is typically administered through the 6-in-1 vaccine, which also contains vaccines against communicable infectious diseases). Second, I should clarify that when I talk of vaccination, I will refer both to adult and child vaccination. Typically, vaccination targets children of different ages, and even for a vaccine that is commonly chosen by people of all ages, such as the flu vaccine, there are good reasons for vaccination policies to target children rather than adults, given that children suffer higher influenza incidence rates and are therefore more likely to cause seasonal influenza epidemics (Bambery et al. 2017). Thus, vaccination choices are often choices that adults make on behalf of their children. But adult vaccination is equally important from the point of view of public health, given that adults contribute to vaccine coverage rate and to spreading infections in the same way as children do. It might be thought that referring to both types of vaccination at the same time creates problems when it comes to discussing ethical obligations with regard to vaccination; for example, it is one thing to say that an individual has an obligation to be vaccinated, and it may be quite another thing to say that an individual has an obligation to vaccinate a child who is not competent, or in any case does not have the authority, to consent. I will address this concern in Chap. 2, when I discuss the ethical obligations with regard to vaccination decisions. Third, I will not be talking about special obligations of certain particular groupsâfor example, health workersâwith regard to vaccination. The reason is simple: since I will be arguing that everybody (with a few exceptions) has a moral obligation to be vaccinated and should be subject to a legal obligation to be vaccinated, talking about âspecialâ obligations of certain subgroups would not add anything substantial. For instance, health workers have a moral obligation and should be subject to a legal obligation to be vaccinated not qua health workers but simply qua members of communities with the collective responsibility to realize herd immunity."

If you look at funding profiles of humanities scholars as opposed to social sciences scholars, thereâs just much less out there. And if you compare it to the natural sciences, itâs even more dramatic. Often the library is identified as the core support structure: (E14) In the humanities, the highest cost comes from subscriptions to magazines, journals and reviews (online or not), which tend to be really expensive because of some editorsâ monopoly. Some disciplines also require special materials, e.g. linguistics, but generally speaking infrastructure costs in the humanities are low, for we do not need laboratories, machines and so on, like in the sciences. We do not have enough rooms for offices because places were built and attributed according to the approximate number of intern ordinary professors (and collaborators); this did not include visiting professors or research fellows, PhD students, etc. It is difficult to deal with this issue and find sustainable solutions. Besides, funds allocated to indirect expenses for infrastructure, maintenance and administration of research projects, which are called overheads, cannot help us to solve this problem. It is clear, however, that support needs are developing: (NA7) I needed research assistants to gather data, I needed statisticians, so then you need a team. Thatâs why my RO1 needed $2 million over five years. I would need equipment and I would need to rent space. And thatâs typical for scientific research and why it needs so much funding. Another respondent felt that, while digital equipment needs for humanistic research are increasing, the major investment needs are in the collections and repositories: (ME2) The humanities tend to work with a rather light infrastructure, if any.

Following Anders Brennaâs example of the weather stations, we might argue that all Spreadsheets needs to do is to install more measuring stations and measure more.

A device could even analyse usersâ blood to gauge something of their emotional arousal. No doubt such devices are already used in medical research.

Although we can add up how much direct tax we pay, indirect taxes are difficult to account for as they are not always clearly stated. On the receipt side there is obviously no way to estimate the pay-offâhow much welfare and other governmental services are given in return (for taxes paid). Exchanges, for example tax payments, between inhabitants and state are vast even on a daily basis, and are impossible to quantify or account for, and immensely complicated in a welfare state. Recognizing reciprocity, the receive side is as important to consider, as we also want to evaluate what we get for taxes paid. What is the worth of my daily welfare services? How can I evaluate the standard of the streets I walk? What is the value of the health services I receive in times of need? What is the worth of the schooling I have attended, or that my children have gone through? Is the state I pay tax to governed by values I share? In quantitative terms these are silly questions, but from a qualitative perspective they are important, as various nations have defined their servicesâsuch as the welfare they provideâdifferently. Such calculative endeavour is completely futile. What we get for taxes paid is rather a comparison in time and space; of a glorified past where things were rosier and the state more generous or giving services of better quality. It could also be the opposite, where we recognize improvement over how things were in the past. The same comparison goes for spaceâcomparing what we get with that which other municipalities/regions/nations provide for their members. Yet, as we will see, in Sweden there is a recognition of a such a reciprocal relationship. From a residentâs perspective, taxes paid do indeed have an impact on the expectations of what society should provide. To underline, it is a perception game. This is also why reciprocity is a better way to express the relation between states and their citizens instead of through an expected monetary outcome of a series of taxable market exchanges. Such a change of focus moves our scrutiny away from tax percentages as an explanatory factor for the propensity of citizens to pay their taxes (cf. Allingham and Sandmo 1972). A very simplified conclusion of Allingham and Sandmoâs article is that taxpayers are always maximizing their income in relation to tax payment and penalty fees. Accordingly, a taxpayer will report and pay just enough tax, weighing the outcome of successful tax avoidance against being caught and paying penalties. It is not only at the Swedish Agency that this seminal model has been used to create strategies against evasion in order to increase compliance (Skatteverket 2005). As we"

In fact, the most innovative aspect of BOOTs is the binding role that an educational facility like the HvAâas a fresh and more neutral actor in the field of welfare provisionâplays between different (welfare) organizations that are operating within the same territorial boundaries, yet not necessarily cooperating much. When BOOTs first started, for many welfare organizations that were already in those neighbourhoods, this was a difficult transition to make, as they had been used to providing a particular service in a certain way and were generally very much focused towards the insideâon their own activities/ organization. BOOTs bring many of these different, so far disconnected, actors together, which not only provides a clearer overview of the services that are present in a certain neighbourhood and of those that are lacking but it also stimulates all partnering organizations to have a more outward look. As the manager of BOOT noted: (â¦) You have to give it a lot of time to build up a trusting relationship.

One young history student I met at a seminar for multi-perspective textbook writing told me he is most interested in the Ottoman period. But I was surprised to learn he was studying at SveuÄiliste because I had thought that this period would be taught in more detail at DÅ¾emal BijediÄ. Although the young historian confirmed my assumption, he made it very clear that he, as a Croat, would want to study history at SveuÄiliste."

Until recently, we have not attempted to âcapture allâ. Collections have usually required some form of selection and curation. When we make photo albums or write diaries or post a photo to Instagram we intentionally choose what we want to remember and share and what we want to leave out. What happens when we automate the process? What happens when we try to capture everything? The Narrative Clip is one of the first consumer products that promises to visually capture all of your life. The website explains, âThe Narrative Clip is a tiny, automatic camera and app that gives you a searchable and shareable photographic memory.â You clip the camera onto your clothing and it takes a photo every 30 seconds. âRemember every moment,â the website urges as of 28 May 2014: Capture the moment as it happens, without interference.

Firstly, the editors were especially sceptical about the agendas of private asylum proprietors, pointing out that it was in their best financial interests to retain patients rather than cure them. Secondly, they heavily criticised the families of patients for failing to care for them in the home. In doing so, they revealed that their issue lay more with confinement itself, rather than any unpleasant conditions identified in the private asylums: To read the prospectus of some Private Asylums, we would fancy them to be each a little paradise. Employment is provided, and amusement. There are games, balls, private theatricals, and concerts. In fact, all are to be treated as âmembers of a family.â Why, then, does not the family to which a lunatic belongs provide all this solace which we are so ready to pay for? Why must we cloak our selfishness under the guise of affectionate relationship? Why must we bury each insane member of our kindred, as we do our dead, out of our sight, and comfort ourselves with the complacent notion that we pay largely to provide a haven for him?"
315,384,0.961,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"members of this group do not identify as religious, although they do access cultural elements that often have religious associations. Lakshmi, a 22-year-old Indian American whose relatives migrated from India to East Africa during British colonial rule, exemplifies this global-secular trajectory. Lakshmiâs maternal grandparents relocated to Uganda while her paternal grandparents settled in Tanzania. When dictator Idi Amin expelled the South Asian population from Uganda in 1972, her extended family resettled as refugees in England, Canada and the US. As a result, Lakshmi came into regular contact with secular Indians scattered across the globe. Growing up, she says, it was not uncommon to stay completely within this ethnic milieu or to venture out tentatively, always knowing one would return. Lakshmi reports she is in constant contact with friends and family, phoning, texting or Skyping them regularly. This is a group, she says, that lives, works and studies abroad and is as comfortable in London as they are in Bombay because they have the money and the cultural capital to recreate Indianness anywhere. Although she has only been to India once, she proclaims proudly, âI identify as an Indian. Even though I might not be super-religious, itâs still part of my identity. I think going to college had a huge impact on thatâ¦ I ended up joining the South Asian society and took a lot of classes and learned more about my cultureâ. Now, as a medical resident, Lakshmi wants to put into practice the values her parents taught her by working in global public health. She hopes one day to return to Uganda or India in order to spearhead a long-term public health project. When asked what compels her to give back to others, she explains, âI do feel a responsibility to do some form of service work. But I wouldnât say I feel itâs my responsibility as a Hindu or as the daughter of my parentsâ¦ I just feel it comes from being a good human beingâ. She has internalized the values she learned at home and aspires to serve by being a âgood personâ rather than a âgood Hinduâ. She is also motivated by elements of a widely-circulating neo-liberal global values package that emphasizes development, modernity and progress. Lakshmi locates herself squarely within a secular, Indian global space, although she lands there in part through her direct and indirect connections to global religious actors. She traverses religious and non-religious channels to arrive at a secular destination. From where she sits, religion and culture often overlap. While some of her cousins associate more strongly with religion, she identifies more closely with Indian culture. Yet both end up feeling connected to other Indians around the world. Not just the Hindu young women in our sample identified as global secularists. Zahira, like Lakshmi, was also raised in a large Indian family scattered across the globe. She, too, maintains especially close ties to her cousins and wants to feel part of the secular global community. But as an Indian Muslim women, she feels pushed toward religion because the Indian cultural groups she encounters do not make space for those who identify with Islam. Growing up, Zahira was often mistaken as white because she is light-skinned and does not appear âtypically Indianâ. To meet other Indian Americans when she first went to college, she attended meetings of the South Asian Student Club but came away disappointed. She found that because she was Muslim, the members dismissed"

In the paper we argue that the understanding of an object (physical or non-physical) is greatly enhanced by the ability to measure that object. Indeed, Lord Kelvin suggested, over 100 years ago that : : : when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be."

Given that we arenât necessarily going to get the capital from somewhere, we need to keep earning money while we also try to hit our targets. On this point, I think the question of whether or not parts manufacturers are going to compete over research and development plays an extremely big role. All of the main components for the first-generation Prius were developed and manufactured by Toyota. However, once parts manufacturers come to think of this as a new business opportunity, the total number of engineers involved increases dramatically. Those people all wind up competing for us. In that sense, we fully recognize the importance of our stakeholders. The Environmental Challenge 2050 is not a matter of Toyota arbitrarily coming up with targets that we can achieve through our own efforts. Collaborating with equipment makers, parts manufacturers, and distributors among other is indispensable. Furthermore, in the years ahead energy companies will also be part of it. To reduce the CO2 emissions of new vehicles to zero, we naturally are keeping an eye on developments with fuel-cell powered vehicles, for example, as well as would-be âhydrogen societyâ The questions of whether Japan as a country can make hydrogen part of its core infrastructure and whether the energy industry will wade into the field are extremely important. Nobody is going to build a hydrogen-fueling station if you ask them to do it just because Toyota has built a fuel-cell powered vehicle. We are doing this because once everyone thinks that hydrogen is going to become an important part of the infrastructure we would then decide to put out vehicles that use hydrogen."

For the middle-class girls, however, the bodily transition is more disturbing: Vilde remembers that she was proud not to get her period since that meant that she worked out a lot, something her father appreciated. These middle-class girls are even more negative with regard to their menstruation than the women in the eldest generation. The period is characterised as âa real botherâ, âhellish crapâ, âa little strangeâ, âembarrassingâ or directly âickyâ. Eva, who could shout across the classroom that she needed to borrow a tampon, tells us that she is completely disgusted by the blood. Across all three generations of women, bodily appearances and looks represent an area that is much less surrounded by taboos than generative development and maturing processes. The differences between the two eldest generations were a greater differentiation of flaws and assets, as well as a drastically increased energy (and resources) invested in bodily improvements. In the youngest generation the detailed catalogue of flaws is replaced with a general preoccupation, bordering on obsession, with the bodyâs size, shape and weight (see also Bordo 1993; Brumberg 1997). It is an issue that is strongly present in the interviews regardless of whether the women feel overweight or not. The vast majority have been dieting, and quite a few have, as one of them puts it, had âa touch of anorexiaâ. To almost stop eating makes one feel good, in control. Oda, whose mother as a young girl used to compare her weight with that of Miss Norway, first assures us that she does not have a problem with her body and then admits reluctantly that she often gets annoyed with herself if she eats without having worked out. On days like that she throws up: I was completely exhausted when I was doing ballet, and I just ate and ate and ate when I was done. I was so exhausted. And thatâs when I became dissatisfied and threw up. Oh! Yuck [silently]. (Oda, 18)"
0,12,0.961,Library and Information Sciences : Trends and Research,"example, with a more highly information literate workforce, private sector companies can expect that their workers will work smarter at whatever they do, and therefore produce at a higher rateâwhatever the products and services involvedâthan ever before. But I want to concentrate on librarians and information professionals because most of you are in that career area already, and I therefore want to try to address your needs and expectations, and try to deal with some of your fears and misgivingsâreal or imagined. To begin with, you are going to be in great demand for your knowledge and skills because you can expect that your superiors, colleagues, peers and subordinates, not to mention your family and friends, will have been reading about information literacy and asking many questionsâwhat is it, why is it important to me, how can I learn about it, and how can I practice it so as to improve my life, do my job better, and help my family resolve their problems? They will begin to look to you for the answers to those questionsâperhaps from the moment you arrive back home and go back to your jobs on the first day. They will need training, which is why this workshop is designed to help âtrain the trainers.â So the first opportunity Iâm addressing is that you are in a new and still-emerging profession, the members of which will be expected to have acquired, both in formal schooling, in special workshop opportunities such as this one, as well as in practice, on-the-job, information literacy knowledge and skills. Whether you respond to this demand for your expertise and talents is, of course, entirely up to you. Some of you may be timid, and believe that you have not learned enough to call yourselves information literacy experts. That is understandable. Sometimes titles are not all that important. But, hopefully, many, if not most of you, will, slowly but surely, rise to this demand for your talents, whatever your current job title, and, however modestly, and however carefully you begin to respond to that demand, you will, eventually, be looked up to in your organization as one of the, if not THE information literacy expert! Many professionals are in stable or even declining fields and careers. But yours is a field that is ascendantârising fastâand the demand will not lessen for years to come. I personally happen to believe it is rising exponentially! Secondly, as the benefits of a more information literate faculty, student body, office worker, laboratory worker, factory worker, and managerial level becomes more visible, quantifiable, transferable and sustainable, inevitably your job opportunities will proliferate and salary levels and other kinds of benefits can be expected to increase commensurately. Do not sell yourself cheaply! Perhaps you may need to transfer, moving to another unit, or even an entirely different organization, to take advantage of new opportunities that are arising. Do not be bashful or hesitant to consider such offers and opportunities. In short, the price tag you command should increase proportionately to correspond with the level of expertise you acquire as you learn more and more about information theory concepts and practices. Like all fields, you start as a beginner, then advance to an intermediate level, and then, sooner or later, go on to an advanced level. Be sure to keep your resume and C.V. up to date to reflect your information literacy expertise and learning. For example, include workshops of this kind in your C.V. so that when a more lucrative and challenging job offer becomes available, you will have a job portfolio that reflects accurately your training as well as on-the-job experience."
143,94,0.961,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"How do you see the current state of human capital development in Kenya for the next generation of entrepreneurs? I do not think universities will be the answer; at least, I have not seen them work for technology education. Graduates fresh out of university are, in general, not prepared to work in a technology company. They are not coming out of these institutions with the necessary skills. The people who do are usually the ones that are self-taught. That is quite disappointing. The universities in Kenya are too bureaucratic and not teaching the right stuff in the classes. Not across the board, but generally, students still learn the same computer languages that they were being taught eight years ago, even though current technology has changed. Why are people still learning these things? And why are they not being challenged to learn new things? And why are university professors not the ones leading the charge on this? I like what the Moringa School is doing, and I like what a couple of the finishing schools for software engineers are doing. I think that is an interesting model and where we will see more hiring happen in the future. I love bringing on people into my own company. The young people who have been self-taught and have a raw sense of what they should do. A raw skill set which allows building and growing them in my company. I think on-the-job trainingâwhether it is for the Mike Macharias and Seven Seas of the world, or Safaricom, or Google, or IBM, or M-Kopa, or Intelâis actually one of the benefits of Nairobi. We have enough of those medium and large companies, and this is what sets us apart from Kampala and Kigali and Dar es Salaam. When you come out of university or even without university, you can get a job with Conrad Akunga or myself in our smaller companies. You can get a job with Mike Macharia at his company or with John Waibochi over at Virtual City or with any number of the smaller five-to-ten-person-size startups scattered across the city. There are a number of tech companies from small to large that are accessible to you, whereas they are not accessible in some of these other cities. The offtake of that is amazing. It means that there are more and more people who are being polished into seeing technology as a business opportunity. They develop an important and unique skill set. This does"

Organic vegetables on the other hand were believed to be grown slower and without such chemical enhancers. Besides the application of chemicals in farming, concerns regarding growth hormones in meat were also frequently voiced. Here a university student, shopping vegetables for her family, explained why she has been restricting her meat consumption: Because I know itâs not good to eat because they have poison in the meat. It means that instead if you raise a pig or a buffalo you need about six months to grow it â¦ and now usually theyâre just three months I think and a few weeks before they sell for the meat company they will get food that helped the pig grow fast in two weeks.

Some elders in Acholi and Madi were unwilling to cleanse returning soldiers at ancestral shrines, âaware that these young men had killed indiscriminatelyâ.109 The soldiers, moreover, likely âhad no intention of submitting to the authority of elders, or to a ceremony at which they might be publicly castigated for their behaviourâ.110 Alice Lakwenaâs initiation ceremony, meanwhile, which included placing her hands on the heads of new recruits and cleansing them of past actions, offered a way out of the dilemma of cleansing.111 In the context of long histories of war and violence, and in a situation where most were now living in extreme poverty and deprivation, it seems likely that many got by just because they had to. This is perhaps best illustrated by the stories told by street children immediately following the coup in Kampala on 27 July 1985. As one boy recounted: On Saturday, 27 July, people were running, and I asked âWhy do you run?â Soldiers started to come, running, shooting up in the air and around. I thought, the soldiers will enter the market and steal everything. I moved out my bicycle. I started to ride hard. At Queens Way the soldiers were stopping all the cars. I saw a roadblock ahead, many military. They were looting motorcycles, money, watches, everything. I didnât stop. I found a small place where I could pass. They didnât contact me on my bicycle. I rode like a bullet straight home. I found cars breaking down on the way. No number plates. Shooting. When cars fail, people loot tyres, seats, everything. Stay home, I told my brothers. On Monday, I found dead people on the way. All shops were empty. For me I was just surviving. I was feeling bad because of the shooting. I came back to the market to help white people find food - you know my job.112"
390,474,0.961,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"It would also be convenient to add a Clear button, which clears the contents of the flip-flops, the counter, and all the latches in preparation for accumulating another running total. An interactive version of the complete Triple-Byte Accumulator is available on the website CodeHiddenLanguage.com. By now it should be obvious why I defined the four instruction codes the way I did. I wanted to use the bits directly in the circuit. I wanted one bit to indicate an addition or subtraction, another bit to indicate subtraction, another for writing the result into memory, and another to halt. If I had just used the numbers 01h, 02h, 03h, and 04h, additional circuitry would have been necessary to decode those values into separate signals. It should also be obvious why I decided to use 3 bytes for storing each number rather than 4. This allowed using the A0 and A1 bits of the memory address to control the various latches in a very direct manner. If I had used 4 bytes for each number, then the operation codes would have been stored at memory address 0000h, 0005h, 000Ah, 000Fh, 0012h, and so forth, which would have made it more difficult to store everything in the correct latches. I am now ready to define two words that appear in the title of this book: hardware and software. The Triple-Byte Accumulator clearly illustrates the distinction: The hardware is all the circuitry, while the software consists of the codes and data stored in memory. They are called âsoftâ because they are easy to change. If you mistype one of the numbers, or mix up the codes for addition and subtraction, you can easily change the values. Meanwhile, the circuitry is much harder to change. That is true even if the circuitry is only simulated, as on the CodeHiddenLanguage.com website, rather than consisting of real-world wires and transistors. Yet the Triple-Byte Accumulator demonstrates a very intimate connection between hardware and software. The codes and numbers are stored in flip-flops in memory, and the bits that make up these values become signals that integrate with the rest of the hardware. On the most basic level, both hardware and software are just electrical signals interacting with logic gates. If you were to build your own Triple-Byte Accumulator and use it to keep track of your small-business finances, you might be justifiably nervous if the business begins succeeding more than you anticipated.

Rather, as he writes: My special concern, all too tightly framed here, is the use of computers to help people write, think, and show. But I think presentation by computer is a branch of show biz and writing, not of psychology, engineering or pedagogy.

253,123,0.961,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","killed on impact. If you do not swerve, both victims will be struck and killed; so there is good reason to think that you ought to swerve one way or another. But what would be the ethically correct decision? If you were programming the self-driving car, how would you instruct it to behave if it ever encountered such a case, as rare as it may be? Striking the grandmother could be the lesser evil, at least to some eyes. The thinking is that the girl still has her entire life in front of herâa ï¬rst love, a family of her own, a career, and other adventures and happinessâwhile the grandmother has already had a full life and her fair share of experiences. Further, the little girl is a moral innocent, more so than just about any adult. We might agree that the grandmother has a right to life and as valuable a life as the little girlâs; but nevertheless, there are reasons that seem to weigh in favor of saving the little girl over the grandmother, if an accident is unavoidable. Even the grandmother may insist on her own sacriï¬ce, if she were given the chance to choose. But either choice is ethically incorrect, at least according to the relevant professional codes of ethics. Among its many pledges, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), for instance, commits itself and its 430,000+ members âto treat fairly all persons and to not engage in acts of discrimination based on race, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expressionâ [23]. Therefore, to treat individuals differently on the basis of their age, when age is not a relevant factor, seems to be exactly the kind of discrimination the IEEE prohibits [18, 33]. Age does not appear to be a relevant factor in our scenario as it might be in, say, casting a young actor to play a childâs character in a movie. In that movie scenario, it would be appropriate to reject adult actors for the role. Anyway, a reason to discriminate does not necessarily justify that discrimination, since some reasons may be illegitimate. Even if we point to the disparity of life experiences between the old and the young, that difference isnât automatically an appropriate basis for different treatment. Discriminating on the basis of age in our crash scenario would seem to be the same evil as discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender, disability, national origin, and so on, even if we can invent reasons to prefer one such group over another. In Germanyâ home to many influential automotive companies that are working to develop self-driving technologiesâthe right to life and human dignity is basic and set forth in the ï¬rst two articles of the very ï¬rst chapter in the nationâs constitution [9]. So it is difï¬cult to see how German law could even allow a company to create a product that is capable to making such a horriï¬c and apparently illegal choice. The United States similarly strives to offer equal protection to all persons, such as stipulated in the fourteenth amendment of its constitution. If we cannot ethically choose a path forward, then what ought to be done? One solution is to refuse to make a swerve decision, allowing both victims to be struck; but this seems much worse than having only one victim die, even if we are prejudiced against her. Anyway, we can force a decision by modifying the scenario: assume that 10 or 100 other pedestrians would die, if the car continued forward; and swerving would again result in only a single death. Another solution could be to arbitrarily and unpredictably choose a path, without prejudice to either person [34]. But this too seems ethically troubling, in that we are"

We produce the substance, we produce pure ideality. But come back to the reduction. However, we can only guess what we throw away when we realize phenomenological reduction? They could be two possibilities: â¢ Either we act so that it will try it and we will imagine that the thing can do without the other properties and therefore these properties are not essential (essence); â¢ Or we have some premonition of what is the nature of thong and on this basis we identify irrelevance properties of thing.

So the natural world - that world, I am talking about and I can speak about- precedes de facto existence the pure ego and his cogitationes as being on that is earlier.[6 Â§ 56] Our approach is something else. We believe that the constitution of any thing as a whole is always the composition properties of the stimuli that were pulling from sensors of entities, which are already in advance as a singular. They are what the human mind recognizes through operations identity and negativity, and these properties are combined by human thinking (given together) so way that we realize constituted a thing (for example a cup) as a whole. Properties have their basis in existence. Human thinking is only recognized that as a specific feature in that they are assigned to something what was already defined before by operation of identity and of negativity in encapsulated structure of endocepts. Property is what is formed and what stands out in relationships. Without any relationship can not reveal what actually is, can not reveal their essence. The stimulus comes to the brain even different neuronal pathways and they are also in different parts of the brain identified.

At this point, our practices diverge, depending on the type of respondent. We discern roughly three categories of respondents. The first type, âordinary peopleâ, we typically inform that we intend to anonymize the transcript of the interview and not use their real name if we should cite them. With the second type, âexpert informantsâ, we typically have an exchange about whether and if so how they would like to be anonymized. The third type are âspokespersonsâ, whom we typically ask for their permission to be cited by name."

This takes us part way to finding the idea of âtrue in a caseâ inside of CIFOL+. Let us step back and think for a minute about âtrue in a case.â That phrase is special, partly because there is very little intuitive support for the phrase âtrue in a world,â even though one can be led by well-worked-out formal machinery to prize the idea. A substitute phrase, âtruth according to a worldâ seems marginally more idiomatic, although hardly an expression of conversational English. In contrast, âtrue in a caseâ is somewhat more idiomatic. I donât mean the truth of sentences, which isnât idiomatic at all, but rather certain informal âtrue thatâ expressions relativized to cases: â¢ Itâs true that we shall get wet in case it rains, but otherwise not. â¢ I shall be sad in case you find fault with my examples."
143,434,0.961,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"entrepreneurs, we noticed two challenges getting in the way. One, many ideas are not scalable, usually because the original problem itself is too small. Two, teams rigidly focus on building their idea, as opposed to doing whatever it takes to solve their problem. What do bigger problems look like? When Elon Musk was deciding what to work on after PayPal, he wrote down a list of five issues that will most affect the future of humanity: the Internet, sustainable energy, space exploration (permanent extension of life beyond earth), artificial intelligence, and reprogramming the human genetic code. Tesla and SolarCity were both founded to take on the significant challenge of sustainable energy. And while he initially focused on better electric vehicles, better batteries and solar installation were clear additions. One of our favorite Kenyan companies, Sendy, recognized the need for access to formal goods within an informal and continuously evolving infrastructure. Most folks do not receive goods at an address, making e-commerce mostly ineffective. And between an inconsistently distributed retail sector and terrible traffic, it is costly to track down the goods you might want. Today, Sendy offers real-time, point-to-point urban deliveries using smartphones and motorbikes. But it is not inconceivable for them to manage last-mile scheduling and logistics for any kind of inventory. The challenge is enormous. We can refer back to Tataâs humility as an example of putting problems above ideas. I mentioned his original sketch was a shielded bike. It looked a bit like a fancy rickshaw. However, after two months of prototyping and testing, his team found that consumers were much more interested in an affordable car. So they shifted. As long as he was achieving affordable, safe transit, the specific idea was not important. One might look at our challenge of creating a human-centered, learning mindset around problem solving and say, âObviously you should pursue education for founders or young teams.â But what my time spent doing new business creation and transformation at Jump taught me is that people learn through the work. The evidence continues to grow in"

I had started working a four-day week. My best guess as to why I might have been denied the opportunity to work on the more interesting software, based on converâ sations with other colleagues, was that because I worked reduced hours, I wasnât taken seriously. People working on the really exciting stuï¬ were expected to work evenings and weekends, and of course ï¬ve days during the week. 3. I wasnât giving the job my full attention. It was a vicious circle: I wasnât given interesting work to do, so I focused more on hobbies and family, which meant that I was taken less seriously, which resulted in me paying less attention to my job. So, when I was oï¬ered voluntary redundancy, the decision to leave was not hard. In my exit interview, it was suggested I might try being a social worker! This did not appeal to me. 2.3 The Welcoming Environment of XP By the time I was made redundant, I was very bored of my job. My skills had stagnated so much, that as well as having very little enthusiasm for ï¬nding another software role, I doubted my ability to ï¬nd anything new. As a result of these factors, I left the career altogether. After four years out of the industry, I realised that I was more suited to software development than anything else. I decided to return. I was honest about my out-of-date skills, and got myself a job with a company that specialised in taking on graduates and training them up. It was a revelation. Because of the emphasis on training, employees were not only encouraged, they were exhorted to ask as many questions as possible. There was no problem with people being too busy to help. Everyone in the company was expected to both ask and answer as many questions as possible. The teams I worked with had daily stand-ups, where each team member would report on what they were doing and ï¬ag up any problems. The companyâs design methodology was largely waterfall, but the cultures of communication and collaboration were ï¬ltering through from XP working practices in other parts of the industry. This included regular and in-depth code reviews, and an introduction to the concept of clean code. All of this helped to counter the problems I had experienced before, in the following ways: 1. If I got stuck, I knew that someone would be eager to help me. 2. Daily stand-ups meant that there was nowhere for me to hide. If I had problems, I had to admit them. This was liberating. 3. My code was regularly reviewed in depth â so that I was always getting feedback. 4. The emphasis on clean code meant that I and my peers were focused on making our code accessible to each other. I was now back in the career and enjoying myself enormously. The idea that it was OK to ask questions was exhilarating. It also helped that I had those twelve years of experience behind me, so I no longer felt like everybody else was more experienced than me."

233,61,0.961,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Human Emotional Responses to the Natural World It is also claimed that biodiversity is valuable because the psychological makeup of human beings causes them to feel an intimate connection with the natural world which might be expressed variously in emotions such as love of, or respect for, nature. The idea that such emotional responses are a result of our evolved psychology was promoted by Wilson (1984) and Kellert and Wilson (1993). We note that the so-called Biophilia Hypothesis has received limited support in the literature (Simaika and Samways 2010 p. 903), but let us assume for the moment that we do share a common innate love of nature. There are two important problems with grounding conservation in common emotional responses. Firstly, such responses are not always reliable guides to rational action. There is after all some fundamental fact about human beings that also causes them to see cigarettes as valuable. We donât think that this implies that we should âconserveâ cigarettes, because we donât think that this common emotional response is adaptive. Human beings feel positively disposed toward all sorts of things that are not actually good for us. But if we must then judge the adaptiveness of our feelings toward biodiversity, it seems that conservation justiï¬ed thereby would not be a consequence of our feelings towards biodiversity, but rather of the utility of biodiversity to human populations (to which we turn shortly). Secondly, people clearly differ a great deal in the extent to which they feel positive emotions toward biodiversity (Einarsson 1993). If a general measure of biodiversity is to be inferred from emotional responses to biodiversity, then it seems that we will either have to discount the responses of outliers or average across a relatively large range of responses. Finally, this style of justiï¬cation for conservation suffers from the same problems as conservation based on intrinsic value. Even if it were true that almost everyone attached the same equally strong positive emotion to the conservation of the biosphere, it is hard to see how we could turn universal love of nature into a practically applicable general measure of biodiversity. For these reasons, we think it"

21,56,0.961,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"Intertwingularity is the idea that everything is deeply interconnected on multiple levels. I will therefore describe my own background and experiences with Ted Nelson, comment on some issues raised by other contributors, and describe my views on the intertwingularity of modern popular culture. I have always been interested in both technology and culture, and I attribute this partly to my background. One of my early recollections is that when I was very young and my mother was carrying me around in her arms I would actually reach out to light switches and flip the lights on and off. From the age of about three or four I was particularly fascinated by âexclusive orâ light switches, where you have a room with the need for switches at two different doors and so they are wired up in such a way that both switches control the light and you can turn it on or off from either door. As a child I then went on to explore in sequence: electricity, electronics, digital electronics and early computers. We had ancient computers at my school. We had a PDP-8 and then an LSI-11 and an Apple II and so on up through the history of computers. I was interested in each level of hardware: how the physics of transistors worked, how digital circuits were put together, and how CPUs operated. When I was young, I designed a simple CPU and a simple operating system. I asked my brother to sit underneath a desk, fed him instructions, and had him execute them. In parallel with that interest, I have also always been interested in culture, both national cultures and popular culture. My grandfather was an Austrian Jewish industrialist who was murdered by the Nazis, and there is a commemorative plaque for him in Vienna. My grandmother was part of the Bohemian movement and fled to Australia via England, where my father was born. My mother is a musician, and my father is a very educated and cultured gentleman who founded and conducts the Melbourne Musicians orchestra. We always had a lot of books in our house, and as a young boy I read The Complete Sherlock Holmes, The Complete Lewis Carroll, A.

21,80,0.961,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"here, howeverâthis is Nelsonâs party and I donât want to poop it. If you are interested you can find it in my book [1], and the implementation notes are published in the Xuarchives [7]. Iâll just say that it didnât happen the way he wanted it to happen. Nelson had also met Engelbart and seen his landmark NLS system by 1967. The friendship would last until Engelbartâs recent death. (Although Nelson had initially thought this meeting happened in 1967, he found some notes while writing Possiplex and realized it was in 1966. Those notes have since been lost!) He thought Engelbart was warm and wonderful upon first meeting him, though he did not like the âhierarchicalâ structure of Engelbartâs system. He went on to dedicate his book on Xanadu, Literary Machines, to this âvisionary of The Augmentation of Human Intellectâ¦and (what this book is largely about) THE TEXT LINKâ ([9]ââ1987 Dedicationâ included in 1993 edition). Nelson and Engelbart were close: they understood each other on multiple levels. In his passionate eulogy for his friend, Nelson said, âI donât just feel like Iâve lost my best friend. I feel like Iâve lost my best planetâ [11]. Although their visions were different, they shared some similar life experiences. Firstly, Engelbart and Nelson watched their ideas spread around the globe then re-emerge as someone elseâs interpretation, an approximation of a vision. That has upsides and downsides. I remember putting it to Nelson once, in Melbourne, when he was getting a bit despondent about his life, that he has âinspiredâ people. He told me immediately that this was never his intention, and that the problem with inspiring people is that they then try to credit you with things you donât like (Nelson 2011, personal communication). He never set out to âinspireâ people: he wanted to create an entirely new computer world. He wanted to actually build that world, not watch other versions of emerge. The fact that it has not yet been built drives him to continue. Englebart and Nelson also lived through resistance: resistance to those original visions in the 1960s. I donât want to dwell on this, but I think it does need to be said. There have not always been conferences like this one held in Nelsonâsâor Engelbartâsâhonour. Although Engelbart, as an engineer with a prestigious post at SRI, had more basis for conversation with the computing mainstream, what he was doing was not seen as âscienceâ back then either. As the Head of Engineering at SRI told a young Bill Duvall (and Duvall later recounted to me), âYou donât really think what theyâre doing up there is science, do you?â (Duvall 2011, personal communication). That kind of resistance has dogged Nelson for many years. People didnât understand what he was going on about, and neither Ted nor his vision seemed to fit in any one nice explanatory box. As The Economist put it in 1986, âBoon or boondoggle, nobody is quite sureâ (cited in [9], preface). Discussion of Xanadu still positions his work in left field. As others have discussed, in 1974, in Computer Lib, he took his idea to the public, in the hope that he may have better luck there. He argued that computers are mere changeable devices for twiddling symbols that should power this new allsinging, all-dancing media experience for everyone. It was a rallying cry to that cause. Some of the conference attendees were actually around when that book was"

Then they turn away, (even) after that; but those are not in fact believers (in Torah)â (Q. 5:43). The Jews said to themselves let us go to Muhammad in this case of adultery. If he gave a judgment other than stoning (which is the rule of Torah) accept it, but if he insists on Torah rule, then abandon it. And God told the Prophet: âJudge between them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from them-never will they harm you at all. If you judge, judge between them with justice. Indeed God loves those who act justlyâ (Q. 5/42). They were given the choice to have their own judges; but if they came to you O Muhammad (PBUH) (or any Muslim judge) then judge with justice. The Jews in Medina had a peaceful pact with the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), but they didnât keep their pact. Some of them tried to assassinate him, while others tried to bewitch him and even poison him, but many remained peaceful.

Here you are arguing on their behalf in this worldly life but who will argue for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will (then) be their advocate?

Should any problems arise, he will take a practical approach, hiring someone to do the cleaning, for instance. In this case the division of work resembles the previous generation, but with some adaptation to the fact that the partner works and to the dominant discourse of work-life balance. In other cases there is more reverence of the discourse of gender equality in the family, but without the subjective conviction and desire of the men who themselves had fathers who had participated more in childcare and housework. At 30 Rune thinks that he had actually been doing most of the housework in his previous relationship, but he also adds âbut I wasnât pussy whipped!â Paul also had a relationship that included cohabitation behind him when he was interviewed at 30. He had appreciated that his girlfriend had clear ideas about what constituted menâs work and what constituted womenâs work because this meant that both could do what they liked the best. But in the long run he felt suffocated by her nesting. He anticipates problems with combining work and children: if he has a child in a new relationship, he imagines that he cannot continue in such a creative job as he has now. He says he feels split between not wanting to have a family and not wanting to be socially isolated. The connection between attitudes to gender equality and the division of work in the families in which they grew up is less clear-cut for the women. A traditional division of work may rather boost the young womenâs critique of their parents, and spur them on to wanting something different for themselves.13 Anja made it clear that she did not want to marry someone like her own father, who is always busy at work: âif I ever get a husband and have children, I certainly hope that he too will take care of those childrenâ. Tonje also expected her future husband to be participating more because âtimes changeâ. Thus, it seems that the general discourse about gender equality has had a more independent impact on the girls, while the boys to a greater degree need a model in their own family of upbringing to get the point. All the young women wanted to combine"
185,98,0.96,The Essence of Software Engineering,"This is not a new observation. Over all these 50C years we have been searching for a better method. In some ways our methods of developing software have dramatically changed over time, in other ways they have stayed much the same. As an industry we have followed a zig-zag path moving from paradigm to paradigm and from method to method, changing very much like the fashion industry inspires wardrobe changes. Every new method adoption is generally a very expensive, demoralizing affair. It is expensive because it means retraining the software developers, the teams and their leaders. In some cases existing software may even have to be rewritten in order to work more efficiently with new software. It is demoralizing because the more experienced developers feel they have to relearn what they already know. Companies, especially larger ones, realize that having a great method provides a competitive advantage â even if it is not the only thing you need to have. They also realize that their method must be explained and explicit so that it can be applied consistently across the organization. And, they realize that one size doesnât fit for all they do â they need a multitude of methods."
82,227,0.96,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"unjustified foundationalist viewâ (Klein 2007b, 28). His argument is different from ours, in that it refers, among other things, to a reasonâs availability. We however believe that our reasoning about fading foundations can capture Kleinâs most important intuitions, and we will come back to availability in the next chapter. Let us sum up. In doxastic justification the choice is not between indefinitely going on and the unjustified foundations view. There is a third possibility, provided by what we know about infinite chains. Once we have recognized that any justification that Bn gives to B1 diminishes as the distance between the two is augmented, we might decide to stop at Bn because the justificatory contribution that any further belief would bestow on B1 is deemed to be too small to be of interest. When exactly a justificatory contribution is considered to be negligible depends on pragmatic considerations, but our two tables show that we are able to make these considerations as precise as we wish. This third possibility goes unnoticed in the debate between Bergmann and Klein. Because the fact of fading foundations has not been taken into account, they fail to realize that the expression âstopping at a belief Bn â can have more meanings than those that have been envisioned in the literature. It need not mean âmaking an arbitrary moveâ, as some coherentists have claimed. Nor need it imply that Bn is taken to be unjustified or self-justified. Rather, an agent can decide to stop at a belief Bn because she realizes that, for her purposes, Bn+1 has become irrelevant for the justification of B1 . She finds that the degree of justification conferred upon B1 by her beliefs B2 to Bn is accurate enough, and she feels no call to make it more accurate by taking Bn+1 into account. For her, the justificatory contribution that Bn+1 gives to B1 has become negligible, and with our tables she can precisely identify a point at which the role of Bn is small enough to be neglected, where we use the word âjustificatoryâ as before as meaning probabilistic support plus something else. In this way we have given a more precise meaning to contextualist considerations that have been often expressed. For example Klein: The infinitist will take the belief that q to be doxastically justified for S just in case S has engaged in providing âenoughâ reasons along the path of endless reasons. . . . How far forward . . . S need go seems to me a matter of the pragmatic features of the epistemic context.9"

It is easy to accommodate but I will not do so in the rest of this chapter. It would not fit so well in the stit-framework since that would require relating actions/choices across moments in different, incompatible histories which does not seem so natural. One final remark: I am thinking here of âmovingâ as a basic, simple kind of act, such as moving an arm while it grasps the vase or pushing the vase in one movement from one location to another. I am not thinking of âmovingâ as an extended process of some kind requiring the vase to be packed up, transported somehow to the new location, and unpacked (say). In the latter case, the transitions in the diagrams would correspond to executions of this more elaborate âmovingâ process.

In most cases, mothers are described as competent, strong and healthy, often stronger than the many fathers who fell ill or died of exhaustion.

My only two objectives throughout the year were that the children learn to code and have fun. Whether they wanted to work solo, in pairs or in a mob, was entirely up to them. Throughout that year, I observed most organic transitions of my studentsâ learning through various techniques. All children started the year in the classroom learning style. They had a computer and a project sheet each and worked solo, raising their hand as they needed my help. As projects became increasingly complex, many children chose to pair up with their friends in a grown-up XP world we call this âpair-programming by associationâ. In their pairs, the children conversed freely, exchanging jokes and clearly enjoying each othersâ company. However, as the difï¬culty of learning the material continued to increase, some children gravitated towards pairing with their more able classmates who were not necessarily their buddies outside of the classroom. Their conversations became more focused on the task, but the dialogue kept flowing at all times. In each pair there was a leader and an adopter, and both remained engaged throughout. Finally and very importantly, two of my students chose to work solo throughout the whole year. They did not object to helping their peers when prompted, but they clearly performed better and seemed more content having their own space. All children made amazing progress and many of them have taken their learning further. Reflecting on our experience, it is clear to me that the children loved the social aspect of our club just as much as they loved problem-solving. Another observation I made that year is that not everyone is happy in the role of leader despite displaying excellent technical aptitude. And that is a personal choice everyone should be entitled to. Unless these individuals want to step out of their comfort zone and take a leadership role, forcing them into pairing with a less experienced partner will never lead to a good experience. The children gracefully demonstrated the signiï¬cance of emotional intelligence in pair-programming.

They throw whatever they like into the food mixer; orange juice, soup or cartons of cream if they want to beef up the calories. They take jugs of this gruel from the food mixer and pour it into a funnel attached to the tube. The force-feeding takes fifteen minutes but it feels like forever. Youâre in control of nothing. Youâre terrified the food will go down the wrong way and you wonât be able to let them know because you canât speak or move. Youâre frightened youâll choke to death.36"
269,132,0.96,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"Both of us were at the workshop at which a highly regarded interdisciplinary researcher conveyed this strong account of appropriate interdisciplinary practice â one that defended disciplinary turfs and disciplinary expertise. The sentence above was spoken after one of us (FC) had countered what she interpreted as the academicâs territorialized landscape of interdisciplinarity with a question about the untoward relationalities unfurled by postcolonial studies â as well as by other interdisciplinary theoretical domains that have been committed to queering the pitch of orthodox histories and geographies. In many ways, we understood this researcherâs response. In calling for interdisciplinarity, no one wants to be misunderstood as championing sloppiness, and few, we imagine, want to be interpellated as the inevitable jack of all trades and master of none. We certainly would not want to find ourselves endorsing, say, an analytical philosopher who planned to get by in an interdisciplinary project, untrained, as a sociologist; we do not wish to champion an anthropologist who imagines she can, in a trice, become a conceptual artist. But in this chapter we want, nonetheless, to challenge the spatial logic of fences and neighbours â and the specific forms of territory it brings into being. Here is discipline thought through the figure of the happy householder â willing to reach over the fence, for sure, but still very keen to maintain a proper sense of where the boundaries lie. Indeed, there is an important claim embedded in this metaphor (and one hears it all the time) of good fences, insofar as it dramatizes what is still sometimes an unquestioned assumption about the primacy of the private space of disciplinary training. Whatever our â and your â feelings about private property might be, it strikes us that there is a pernicious notion, embedded here, that maps intellectual inquiry on to the taken-for-granted boundaries of relationships between public and private space. (In this regard, we find it intriguing that many writings that address cross-disciplinarity employ language that conjures private property relations. We might turn, for example, to the philosopher Brian Massumi, who discusses the âpoachingâ of a scientific concept (which, moreover, on his account, does not result in âprevent[ing] it from continuing to function in its home environmentâ, and who maintains that if he âwere a concept, [he] could emigrate and stay behind in [his] home countryâ [italics in original] (Massumi 2002, 21)); or to Thomas Osborne, who describes interdisciplinary movements via languages of poaching and trespass (Osborne 2013).) What would change, for the kinds of projects that we are trying to bring into"
143,91,0.96,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Erik, there is a lot of controversy about government intervention into private-sector activities. What is your take? What should be the ideal role of government? So the role of the government is very simple: To reduce friction in the system for the technology industry to grow. What does that break down into? It breaks down into regulation that is actually good for businessâ speed of setting up business, tax breaks for new companies, things like that. Another example of friction in the system that does not need to exist is legacy laws that are 30 to 40 years old and put a 20 to 30 % duty on components imported into the country. I can import a fully assembled, packaged BRCK duty free. Yet the components to make it have a heavy import dutyâwhich means it does not make sense to import. In other words, I cannot create a new manufacturing industry in Kenya if we do not have the ability to bring in raw materials that are not produced in Kenya. Like this, we never will create industries unless we change these legacy laws. So again, governmentâs job is to reduce friction. And by reducing friction, they increase wealth and they increase jobs. Then there are other things, such as providing foundational access, of which the subsidization of the undersea cable by the government was a massive example. That is exactly what the government should be doing, massive projects that bring in both the public and private sectors and help things move further. Another one is regulation around spectrum allocation or licencing. How about foreign aid and NGOs? What should their role be? In a well-functioning state, most NGOs would not exist. There is only a limited role for them, because the market answers many of the problems, and the government should answer the rest. However, here in Kenya, we have one of the highest count of NGOs per capita in the world. It is an interesting dynamic though, because international NGOs bring in money for some things, which bastardizes the market for other things. It creates a whole realm of craziness that you would not find in other places. Let me give you an example. NGOs build bridges that after two years become dysfunctional. This cost a few million US dollars to make, and"
261,48,0.96,The Poetics and Politics of Alzheimerâs Disease Life-Writing,"Their small number as well as their insufï¬cient analysis in a broader context has encouraged me to bring all patient accounts I became aware of during my studies into the present considerations: to the best of my knowledge, I have considered all popular press ï¬rst-person accounts, including the print-on-demand texts available until 2013/2014 (though the number of print-on-demand texts steadily rises). By comparison, I had to choose which caregiver narratives to include in this consideration. Reading widely on the caregiversâ plights and burdens, I realised that there are recurring themes in their telling, and these eventually suggested the structure of this book. Within these themes, I then selected texts that appeared particularly poignant or rich in their emphasis and presentation. Aiming to offer accounts of a diverse range of narrative forms and artistic expressions, I include memoirs, diaries, ï¬lms, graphic novels, photo and picture books in my reading, and discuss them in relation to the limited existing scholarship on dementia narratives. I study textual narratives and visual material side by side, following Alan Radleyâs conviction that a focus on âquestions to do with serious illness, its understanding and the social response it provokesâ allows for such comparative reading.42 Of course, the argument could now run that including patient blogs or interviews would signiï¬cantly enlarge the sample. But I explicitly focus on accounts available on the book market, because, as for example Vai Ramanathanâs dementia discourse analysis illustrates, depending on the audience we expect, we frame our story differently.43 A blog may be freely accessible, but its primary audience is the intimate network of individuals confronted with similar experiences, so that much knowledge remains unsaid because it is already shared.44 In writing for the general book market, authornarrators address a reader and publisher with a different set of expectations. This is partly related to the fact that â set against the transience of knowledge in the fast moving tweeting and chatting online world â a book allows for"
356,167,0.96,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Functional and Non-functional Requirements Based on our user story as well as an analysis of the educational context led us to the identification of the following requirements. Although somewhat controversial (Glinz 2007), we distinguish them between functional and non-functional requirements. The identified problem was translated into high-level functional requirements using the user story format (Cohn 2004): âAs a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>â: â¢ As a Learning Designer, I want to create new Learning Designs and publish these so that they can give inspiration to Teachers. â¢ As a Learning Designer or Teacher, I want to find innovative Learning Designs and create a personal copy so that I can edit them to suit my needs. â¢ As a Learning Designer, I want to publish Learning Designs I have adapted or created to a shared space so that I can share my best practices. â¢ As a Teacher, I want to easily find a Learning Activity Design and together with its required Learning Resources at a central place, so that I can make these Learning Resources available to my Learners when conducting the Learning Activity. â¢ As a Teacher, I want to take advantage of other Teacherâs assessment of Learning Designs so that I can easier find highly relevant ones that actually work in practice. Beyond the functional requirements the key non-functional requirement Interoperability was identified. In order to support the exchange of Learning Designs beyond system boundaries the systems involved need to be interoperable. Interoperability indicates the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged (IEEE 1991). Interoperability research distinguishes between interoperability on the object, referring to a proper use of the information providedâand interoperability in the communication, referring to an agreed communication protocol between systems (Van Assche et al.). These two aspects of interoperability translated into the requirement to make learning designsâincluding their resourcesâre-useable in different technical contexts as well as the requirement to agree on communication protocols between the various system components."
78,333,0.96,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"1 The Digital Transition as a Reality-Check for Platoâs Utopia Failure Mary Midgley sees philosophy as plumbing, something that nobody notices until it goes wrong: âThen suddenly we become aware of some bad smells, and we have to take up the floorboards and look at the concepts of even the most ordinary piece of thinking. The great philosophers â¦ noticed how badly things were going wrong, and made suggestions about how they could be dealt with.â (Midgley 2001). The bad smells, as I perceive them, concern the proliferation of truisms (including about progress, change and innovation), wrong alternatives (âeither/orâ framing when the âboth/andâ would be much more efficient), and fears and delusion when it comes to thinking and speaking about politics and the public space. It would be wrong to say that we are in totalitarian times: fascism and communism have been defeated and democracy is alive, at least in the EU and other parts of the world. However, I feel that we are unconsciously undermining essential elements of the human condition, as set out by Hannah Arendt in her seminal book The human condition (Arendt 1959): the antidotes against the risk of totalitarianism are thereby weakened to a dangerous extent so that it would not take much more than a spark for the public space to collapse, and this even under the cover of the best governance intentions. The digital transition is an opportunity to âfix the pipesâ, as put by Mary Midgley: it brings about a reality by which some key assumptions underlying our worldview, since Plato, lose ground insofar as they simply stop being efficient. The digital transition projects us into a world where nature is pervasively intertwined with sensors, information devices and machines; we thus increasingly experience a reactive and talkative nature, an animated nature, where it becomes more and more difficult"

An analysis of the uses of these words in different contexts is required in order to establish the connection with intersubjectivity more clearly than I have in this chapter. Note that know, think, and believe do not quite follow the usual S shape. Their trajectories may partly be explained by the many idiomatic uses of these words, which make their frequencies increase at a rate more constant than that of other words. Although I can present only a limited number of examples in these pages, it should be clear that my hypothesis on establishment periods is rich in empirically testable predictions. I invite corpus linguists and child development researchers to continue testing it. Further evidence of the domain called organization of semantic knowledge is the way that metaphors do not come alone. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) convincingly argued that metaphors are organized around schemas such as âargument is war,â âtime is a resource,â and âmore is up.â I have proposed that a metaphor expresses an It is difficult to identify any expression that corresponds to understanding emotions (empathy), for this capacity develops well before words are learned."
82,49,0.96,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"Do we have a finite mind? This is not so clear. We have finite brains, and minds supervene on brains, but does that mean that our mind is finite? What exactly does it mean to have a finite mind? That we cannot have an infinite number of beliefs? But how to count? Moreover, even if we have a finite mind in the sense that our beliefs are finite and therefore countable, this does not prevent us from saying many cogent things about infinities â how is that possible? The routine manner in which epistemologists have rejected infinite justificatory chains is reminiscent of the customary ways in which infinite causal chains have been cast aside. Again, Aristotle appears to have played a major roÌle here. His familiar arguments against infinite causal chains in his Physics and Metaphysics became a well-entrenched part of the philosophical canon. Yet Aquinas and other mediaeval scholars had already pointed out that Aristotleâs arguments may be more restricted than they appear: not every causal regress seems to be vicious, it all depends on what is meant by âcausal connectionâ. So let us take a closer look at Aristotleâs objection to causal regresses and the criticism thereof by the mediaeval schoolmen. This might help us to see why exactly it is that justificatory regresses have been rejected without much ado, and to assess whether such a hasty rejection is appropriate. In Chapter 8, in the final section, we will discuss causal chains in a more modern setting, namely that of causal graphs. Aristotleâs main argument against a causal regress is that it purports to explain a phenomenon, but in fact fails to do so. Suppose an event, an object, or a process A is explained by saying that it is caused by B, and B is causally explained by pointing to C, and so on. If this series were to go on indefinitely, it would remain unclear why A occurred in the first place. The only way to explain the occurrence of A is to refer to a principal or first cause, i.e. something that causes all the other elements in the series, but is itself uncaused. Aristotle stresses that his argument is not confined to a particular kind of causation, but applies to any of the four different causes that he distinguishes, i.e. material, efficient, final or formal: Evidently there is a first principle, and the causes of things are neither an infinite series nor infinitely various in kind. For, on the one hand, one thing cannot proceed from another, as from matter, ad infinitum . . . nor on the other hand 32 Fumerton 2001, 7. We will say more about the conceptual objections to infinitism"

For many years, his study was decorated with the macabre, wallpapered with horrifying cover images of blood and strife, torn off of magazines. He called that inspiration. He gave me a thirst for a worldview, a global understanding of the human condition, as opposed to something regional or cultural. I was given exposure to world politics, critical study, and philosophical thought for as long as I can remember. Both my parents put a primary emphasis on education and scrimped his university salary, living in the most expensive state in the Union, to send my sister and me to private schools. He made me a seeker with an inquisitive mind, instilling the imperative to âquestion authorityâ, including his own. He taught me to stand up for what I believed, even if it went against norms or need (such as kissing up to a boss for job), or friendship. He was always available to discuss parenting rules and was willing to be persuaded to change them if I gave sufï¬cient evidence as to their deï¬ciencies. He was able to question his motives, go against the flow, and entertain new ideas. This took courage, a spirit for adventure in the mind. He was a fantastic and very patient mentor and teacher. I was remedial in math, the only one in my family without a proclivity for numbers. Dad had to coach me in algebra and calculus and did so cheerfully. He also taught me chess. It didnât matter what he was working on. If I had an academic question or confusion, he would drop everything to provide an answer or assistance. He believed in maintaining the physical body for a strong mind. My parents walked every day for exercise until his health failed him. Over the years, they became involved in two sportsâbowling and tennisâand joined leagues so they could compete. He loved competition. All this he gave to me, especially a love for physical activity. He approached sports with the same methodology as his work, studying books and magazines to learn techniques and strategies, then applied his research and taught it to his family. Next, it was practice, practice, practice! A couple of months ago, I went bowling for the ï¬rst time since I was a kid. I felt my father over my shoulder, whispering those long ago instructions in my ear, and my old bowling muscles came alive again under his tutelage. That evening, I felt very close to my Dad. He encouraged me to âDo what you love and the money will come.â This idealism has ruled my life as I followed my heart into a variety of experimental careers, encouraged by him at each risky turn: a Certiï¬ed Public Accountant, a chefâs apprentice, a salesman in food distribution, various positions in the restaurant industry, a working actor in theatre and the entertainment industry, and now a writer working on my ï¬rst novel. Like my Dad, I had artistic yearnings, and have studied and worked in the arts for most my adult life. Dad was the ï¬rst person to encourage my writing shortly after completing my college education, saying for years, even before I started, that I was a better writer than he. There was some fatherly pride in that statement, of course. He gave his daughters the freedom to explore and discover who we were, and then to bring that person to lifeâs challenges with full force. He fostered individuality in a world that often demands conformity. My father walked his talk by applying libertarian standards (his professed beliefs at the time, later to become even more"

Ariely (2012) has a name for what happens when the original moral misgivings concerning a particular option disappears: The what-the-hell-effect. Once the moral resistance has gone, the road lies open for new routines and practices. The following quote from Tyler Hamiltonâs book about being a cyclist in Lance Armstrongâs team illustrates the mentality we can find on the other side of the fence: You could have hooked us up to the best lie detectors on the planet and asked us if we were cheating, and weâd have passed. Not because we were delusional, but because we didnât think of it as cheating. It felt fair to break the rules. (Hamilton and Coyle, 2012)"

Which would have all the features, pointed out earlier, of the Ex-SKF Blog, and if not Pinedaâs poetic skills, at least her ability to communicate scientific concepts and facts in words accessible to lay readers? For this to happen, you must think and act like citizen scientists. You must understand that your value to society is not determined by your expertise; rather, your worthiness as a nuclear expert is determined by your motivations and actions as a private citizen. Because: every technological artifact, from microchip to nuclear reactor, is developed and deployed by human hands, and each one comes into being through a very long chain of human hands comprising the entire process from manufacture through installation to deployment to maintenance. In a so-called normal state of affairs, we pay scant attention to this chain of human hands despite knowing that each pair of hands is attached to an individual human being whose skills and work ethic affect our lives profoundly through their effect on the final quality of the technological artifact they have helped to produce. On the other hand, the abnormal state of affairs is when a crisis suddenly forces us to pay attention to the chain of human hands. In a crisis, such as the meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi NPP, not only do we begin to see the human agency behind technology that normally goes unnoticed, we realize how just a few hands can make an enormous and even irreversible difference in the way the technology under crisis will henceforth affect our individual lives. How communication enters the picture: Although it is true, and not just fashionable, to say that âtelling the whole truthâ can no longer be expected from mainstream media, one of the lessons learned by GKS1350021 is that turning to alternative sources of information via the internet or personal networks was not inherently more assuring or indisputably more reliable. Short of giving up on filtering information altogether, the same questions will appear before us again and again no matter what the form of communication: How are we to understand, assess, and integrate the information that is before us? After March 11, before I had discovered Ex-SKF, I succumbed to ostrich syndrome for a while. As the task of collating and sifting information from different sources became too exhausting, I perversely fixed my attention solely on NHK,"

So when one doesnât speak the language well and when the people speak to you about illnesses or examinations, similarly it is a moment where they donât understand the meaning. Anne-Marie: They donât understand the meaning of the care, and furthermore the linguistic barrier means that already â well, when you see your GP, he has known you for a long time, he can take the time to chat with you (â¦) except that theyâre not going to get a GP, theyâre not going to get someone they know. They arrive at A&E, the doctors have fifteen patients all at the same time, they see a medical problem, theyâre not necessarily going to take the time to chat, and furthermore this immigrant, if he already has a few problems when it comes to speaking French, he is going to have a hard time explaining what is not right with him, and the doctor is not necessarily going to take the time to try and understand everything (â¦) So yes, I think that when they are â especially at A&E â there are âboxesâ for the people who are most serious, and then there is a room where all the stretchers are. So you are in the room, everyone is lying on their side like this, and there are carers who are going in all directions. Staff are moving in all directions, so itâs definitely a bit scary as well, and then you have the impression as well that you are being abandoned because you are there to be cared for and (â¦) they keep you waiting until the results are ready, and then return three hours later to see how you are."

What is climate? What is a model? How do we measure the uncertainty in a model? This chapter introduces some key terms and concepts. We start with some basic deï¬nitions of climate and weather. Everyone will come to this book with a preconceived deï¬nition of what climate and weather are, but separating these concepts is important for understanding how modeling of climate and weather are similar and why they are different. It also makes sense to discuss what a model is. Even if we do not realize it, we use models all the time. So we describe a few different conceptual types of models and put climate models in context. Finally we introduce the concept of uncertainty. As we discuss later in the book, models may have errors and still be useful, but this requires understanding the errors (the uncertainties) and understanding where they come from. Most of these concepts are common to many types of modeling, and we provide examples throughout the text."

Some respondents went a step further and said that monodisciplinary attitudes manifest themselves in institutional ways: NA7: The disadvantage for doing interdisciplinary work, especially for young scholars, is that professional life is still very much embedded within disciplines. And so you donât get credit for multi-authored publications, for example. NA10: There are many challenges of interdisciplinary work. Many of the professional rewards are within disciplines and departments. Interdisciplinary work can be easily marginalised ... R9 (an environmental historian): Many disadvantages concern the position of an interdisciplinary researcher to find her/his place in the professional community. You are not a biologist any more, but for a long time even after getting a degree you are not considered to be a professional historian. It happens because you have no connections, you do not have a prominent teacher in your main field, thus you are not belonging to any group of disciples. This is particularly important for the scientific community in my country where many people have their own professional genealogy, being a disciple of a disciple of a famous intellectual. If these sets of remarks are representative, there is likely to be a tension between funding priorities and more traditional attitudes and, indeed, we did find some respondents reporting such a tension: NA5: Deans are very interested in interdisciplinary research.

For Nelson it has been a long journey, at times a very difficult one, but it has been necessary. Necessary for him personallyâas he puts it in Possiplex, âI have no alternative but to go on. Like Shackleton of Antarctica I find myself enmeshed in a harsh duty that was not the original planâ¦ I will fight for it to my last breathâ [10, p. 339]. He has survived the journey so far, his ideals held high above the mud. But as the Intertwingled conference has demonstrated, as the people who have spoken here have demonstrated, the journey has also been necessary for the computing world. Nelsonâs vision is, I think, the most important vision in the history of computing. Thatâs a tall call, so Iâll need to explain my reasoning. In my book Memory Machines [1], I argue that the idea of a universal digital publishing system, an âopen hypermediaâ system, originated with Nelson. Bushâs vision, though it was about connected items, was analogue. Engelbartâs vision was also profoundly important. He was first to build many of the things we take for granted in modern computing (and I donât mean the mouse; I mean the whole concept of real-time, networked, interactive computing). His contributions would take hours to elaborate. But he was not thinking about hypertext as a domestic thingâsomething your mom and pop would consume over latte and a cheeseburger.

170,367,0.96,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4.3.2 Appreciation by the Family Upon leaving their employment and focusing on their families, the respondents may feel that they are not contributing much. This has to do with the pressure from the society who sees that being a stay-at-home mother is somewhat an unproductive choice. In many cases, those who have acquired a university degree may receive some criticism from family members who see it as a waste of time to study after a degree if not to be used for work for some companies. In facing such dilemma, the respondents would turn to others who are experiencing similar situations within their offline and online communities for support. These supports may be in the form of motivation and encouragement from the communities for them to continue with their decision to work while staying at home and be successful with their choice. At the beginning, my husband was in doubt. He didnât think that I could create something that people would buy. After my business started to grow he began to believe in me.

It is stressed that photographs are introduced in an open manner, such as: Tell me about this house. Tell me who lives with you in this house. To make themes tangible to the child, the interviewer may draw while talking with the childâfor example, the childâs house, parents, siblings, pets, etc. If the child brings up abuse or other relevant topics for the case, the interviewer follows up with questions. The follow-up questions should be open ended, but concrete, and adjusted to the childâs developmental level. For example, You told me your father hits when he gets angry. Tell me more about your father hitting (or being angry). If this question is too open, a more focused question might be: Tell me who your father hits when he gets angry. If the questions are too advanced for the child, they might lose attention and thus their motivation to complete the interview. Difficult questions also increase the potential of incorrect or short answers, such as yes/no and I donât know. As a rule, the interviewer should always follow the childâs lead throughout the whole interview by not ignoring any conversational initiatives the child takes."

These fathers would not have taken on the responsibility of sole caregiving if they had not been forced into it by their partnerâs job circumstances. They would have preferred to take their leave at the same time as their partner and adopt a merely supportive role. After assuming main care provider responsibilities, they reported feeling variably stressed, insecure and overwhelmed, such as exemplified by Daniel.

That a girl should be sexually active and initiate a relationship is not only accepted but also even demanded by most of the young men, since sex should be a reciprocal affair: I remember once when â¦ when she just lay down and waited for me to do everything.

180,120,0.959,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"CEA systematically departs from judgments many people will make about what is fair. The priorities problem asks how much priority we should give to people who are worse off. By constructing a unit of health effectiveness, such as the QALY, CEA assumes this unit has the same value, regardless of who gets it or wherever it goes in a life (âA QALY is a QALYâ is the slogan). But intuitively, many people think that a unit of health is worth more if someone who is relatively worse off (sicker) gets it rather than someone who is better off (less sick) (Brock 2002). At the same time, people generally do not think we should give complete priority to those who are worse off. We may be able to do little for them, so giving them priority means we would have to forego doing more good for others. Few would defend creating a bottomless pit out of those unfortunate enough to be the worst off. Similarly, CEA assumes that we should aggregate even small benefits. Then, if enough people get small benefits, it outweighs giving large benefits to a few. But intuitively, most people think some benefits are trivial goods that should not be aggregated to outweigh larger benefits to a few (Kamm 1993). Curing many peopleâs colds, for example, does not outweigh saving a single life. Finally, CEA favors putting resources where we get a best outcome, whereas people intuitively favor giving people a fair (if not equal) chance at a benefit. Locating an HIV/AIDS treatment clinic in an urban area may save more lives than placing a clinic in a rural area, but in doing so, we may deny many people a fair chance at a significant benefit (Daniels 2004)."

Now, the others had taken over the communal council and carried out projects that he had been in charge of and raising money for, passing it off as their own work. Moreover, they were skimming off money, Alfredo maintained: âAnd they couldnât have done that without accomplices in the Alcaldia and Fundacomunal. I have seen them here, visiting, and I ask myself what they are doing here â¦ they are signing checks and papers and vaina (stuff).â And the copying machine and other items that the communal council had acquired for the common use of the community were long gone; quite convenient since the woman who headed the campaign against him, and now had a central position in the communal council, owned a local copying shop where they charged five bolivares per copy.

297,1748,0.959,The R Book,"you reckon your prior information is worth ? How do I ensure that priors are conjugate? I think you will see what I mean. Analytical solutions to simple Bayesian problems are relatively straightforward, so long as we stick to wellknown distributions like the normal or the Poisson and use conjugate priors. But for realistically complicated models, it is essential to resort to numerical simulation to work out the parameter values involved in quantifying the posterior distribution. It is not so much the priors that represent the principal motivation for using Bayesian models these days, but rather the potential to include all of the important sources of variation in a straightforward way. This has revolutionized statistical modelling in many ï¬elds. Estimating parameter values and their credible intervals by numerical simulation from the posterior distribution represents a quantum step in dealing with the most complicated models, including models with a high ratio of parameters to data points, and hierarchical models with complex spatial or temporal structure."

One may wonder, however, whether the non-relativistic aspect of Newtonian physics might be separable from its assumption of temporal linearity.

223,307,0.959,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"I do not try to be equally transhistorical. But I do subscribe to Craigâs project to develop a âprototypical caseâ (p. 15) or a social core situation of knowledge use by spelling out what one could not do without it. I am less satisfied with his answer. Craig (1990) constructs only a very basic original situation of knowledge, and he actively refuses to introduce necessary extensions. The basic problem he refers to is that reliable information is needed from someone else. It is this other person, not some presocial believer, to whom knowledge is typically (and prototypically) ascribed. This construction has two components. The first is unproblematic, but not sufficient: âTo put it briefly and roughly, the concept of knowledge is used to flag approved sources of informationâ (p. 10). What is missing is, again, a specific way to distinguish knowledge from mere information, however approved its sources may be. Craigâs way of solving the problem brings in the second component: Although there are many possible sources of information, only personal informants are said to have and convey knowledge. Once again, the verb to know is employed to make the distinction plausible, but Craigâs text also includes a substantial pragmatic argument: Natural sources of information and even cultural artifacts cannot cooperate with the seeker of information; other members of her or his epistemic community can. The idea is most interestingly illustrated by books. Craig explains both why he does not want to attribute knowledge in this case and why some notion of knowledge still seems appropriate: Books and the like [are] excellent sources of information, but never, even in the spirit of metaphor, said to know anythingâ¦Not that specialist knowledge of any kind is required to unravel their secretsâa large part of their point is to provide a perspicuous source, accessible to anyone with a command of the language they use. But they have none of the psychology of the prototypical informant: they have no beliefs, they do not act, they are not felt to co-operate with us, and they cannot empathise with us so as to anticipate our purposes. Besides, they have a special place amongst the sources of information: they are the evidence laid down by creatures that are prototypical informants precisely as the most perspicuous vehicle of their information.

So it is with interest that I read this chapter reporting on personal learning environments, but talking about them in the context of intentional teaching, courses, workshops and other planned processes. Self-regulation can occur at many scales. We may choose to control different aspects of the learning process but almost always delegate control to others at many stages, whether to the author of a chapter or learning object, the leader of a workshop, our PLE or the widgets within it. Some tools described in this chapter such as Etherpad and Flashmeeting hinge on social engagement, which entails a need to be at the very least mindful of the schedules, needs and goals of others. This highlights a tension that exists in nearly all PLE implementations, that they support our social learning activities, but that those social learning activities themselves, with our fellow learners and teachers, provide shape and form to our learning. For instance, I was not surprised to read that relatively little use was made of Etherpad and Chat in the events described: given that participants were collocated it would not normally be very useful to provide alternative real-time collaboration tools, especially as the tasks did not appear to focus on production of a permanent artefact but were simple part of some active experimentation to use the toolset. At the heart of all my reflections on this chapter is the fact that PLEs are more than just a way to keep things organized in our learning lives. Done well, they are generative toolsets that can act in some ways like a teacher, offering guidance, inspiration, motivational support and structure to the learning experience. But, at the same time, they seek to provide freedom from such a teacher role, to be soft tools to support self-regulated learning. They are thus both teachers and not teachers at the same time. Their innate softness is perhaps the reason that the evaluations performed in this chapter focused on helping people to use the tools in a manner that is anything but self-regulated and explains why it is so hard to pin them down. A PLE is personal: every individual builds processes and methods around them, configures his or her own space but, at the same time, that space is shaped and influenced by the people, resources, learning objects, tools and expertise that are available. This tension lies at the heart of education. When we educate ourselves we choose the parts that we delegate to others more than those who follow a more guided path but, through the shape of our tools, the people around us and simple path dependencies, we have many of our decisions made for us and, at a finer granularity, always delegate at least some of the teaching process to others. Getting the right balance is a tough task to perform well and partly explains why case studies like the one presented here have a vital role to perform in helping us to understand that better."
147,317,0.959,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"future. Indeed, in this book, we have hopefully established a number of trailheads (based on current state-of-the-art knowledge about important aspects of the entrepreneurial process) and then offered some insights into possible trails that can be blazed from these trailheads. The proposed trailblazing has largely focused on the notion of individualsâ thinking, feeling, and acting in relation to potential opportunities embedded in communities and often extreme contexts. This is not to say that there are not important trails to be blazed at the entrepreneurial team, firm, institutional, regional, and other levels of analysis. These levels of analysis are not within our area of expertise, so it is more difficult for us personally to highlight potential trails at these levels of analysis even though we believe that they exist. We look forward to seeing advancements at these levels of analysis as well. Regardless of the level of analysis (or across levels of analysis), maintaining an open mind to novelty is critical. We need to have an open mind about the philosophical approach. This does not mean that an author should use a different philosophical perspective for each paper (although he or she certainly could) but that we should be open enough to allow others to have a different philosophical perspective underlying their research. If we converge on a specific philosophical perspective, perhaps as the result of more closed-minded editors, reviewers, and authors, then we discourage trailblazing and âkill offâ an important source of potential new insights. We are not advocating an approach of âanything goes,â but we, as scholars, should (should is a strong word, but it emphasizes our strong belief) judge research based on the traditions and expectations in which it is embedded. In a similar way, it is important that entrepreneurship scholars remain open-minded to different theoretical lenses and ways of generating new theory. Indeed, to the extent that people can apply new theories to entrepreneurship research, there is an increased chance of uncovering new insights into entrepreneurial phenomena as well as making contributions back to the literatures from which these âborrowedâ theories come. Therefore, while we can borrow theories to understand entrepreneurial phenomena, it is important to go one step further and look toward âblendingâ to make a contribution back to the solutionsâ origins. That is, in applying a specific theory (from outside the entrepreneurship domain), what adaptions to that theory are required to apply it to an aspect of the entrepreneurial context?

Deï¬nitions 1 and 2 described hate speech in terms of, respectively, making negative, prejudiced remarks, and offending/insulting (Danish verb âfornÃ¦rmeâ). The reactions to these two deï¬nitions were very similar. The majority felt that they both captured the idea of hate speech, but one participant did not consider prejudiced remarks to come under the hate speech umbrella. Everyone agreed that both deï¬nitions should not be subject to any form of legislation for ideological reasons concerning freedom of speech and practical reasons in relation to the wording and enforcement of any such laws: (66) Again, one is moving into a dangerous zone. Okay what can one say and what can one not say. So itâll become a totalitarian state. (P3, FG2) (67) I mean I think it would be really, really difï¬cult to formulate some kind of proposed law against this type (prejudiced remarks) (P1, FG2) Interestingly, however, in relation to deï¬nition 2 (insulting/offending), there was a sense in one focus group that this was more of a grey area in relation to legislation: (68) This is a bit more serious you know because it is, it when you consciouslyâ¦ (P4, FG2) (69) Yeah so you almost attack. (P3, FG2) Insulting/offending then is perceived as more serious than making prejudiced comments as this involves a deliberate attack on someone. Context is also seen as important when it comes to regulating this form of hate speech; it all depends on who initiates the hate speech and why (e.g. Is it individuals or hate groups? Is it due to emotion or ideology?) (70) When you are upset with someone, so you can also say some hate speech things, canât you? But I mean there is again this limit because there are these, like, for example, gangs, like, for example, White Pride and things like that, which are practically an organisation based on hate. Where again, where is the limit? (P4, FG2) The third deï¬nition encompassed the notion of threat, which was rarely mentioned explicitly by participants when giving their own deï¬nitions of hate speech. Part of the reason for this may be that threats seem to be viewed as possible criminal actions."

If we look back at the birth of the modern computer in the 1950s, nobody could have predicted how much computers would change society and how dependent we would become on them.

These quotes are out of context. The authors were generally referring to specific types of computers, but the impression they give, though exaggerated, is true.

Turing did discuss chess playing and artificial intelligence, but nobody predicted that the rise of e-commerce and social media would come to dominate so much of our lives. Quantum computing is now in its infancy, and the comparison to the first computers seems apt. The machines that have been constructed so far tend to be large and not very powerful, and they often involve superconductors that need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures. Already there are some people saying that there will be no need for many quantum computers to be built and that their impact on society will be minimal. But, in my opinion, these views are extremely shortsighted. Although it is impossible to predict what the world will be like in fifty years time, we can look at the dramatic changes in quantum computing over the last few years and see the direction in which it is heading. It might be some time before we get powerful universal quantum computers, but even before we"

Like the eldest generation, and in contrast to the middle generation, the women in the youngest generation place themselves in their mothersâ worldâhowever, since it is a world of both talking and doing, it is a world that is no longer so clearly defined by gender. In this way, the young womenâs identification with their mothers appears to be less gendered than the young menâs identification with their fathers. It is also likely that the mothersâ own borders vis-Ã -vis their daughters have become clearer than in the previous generation, not only because of the mothersâ lives outside the family, but also because the daughters are allowed to test these borders through quarrelling. A huge majority of the women in this generation report a good relationship with their mothers, but we still find more women than men who have difficulties with their parents, especially mothers. In these cases the mother is seen as selfish in the sense that she does not meet the needs of the daughter because she has prioritised her own career or a relationship with a new partner at the expense of her children. The daughters experience this as a betrayal and they often express ambivalent feelings of resentment and longing. One of the middle-class daughters feels abandoned by her parents after their divorce, but her sore feelings come up especially in her relationship with her mother: Maybe she doesnât care about itâlike, doesnât care about my life â¦ I imagine that â¦ she has the ability to understand me and I have the ability to understand her because we are quite similar. But at the same time I feel a lot of the time like we donât understand each other too."
245,1291,0.959,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"instruments through which they may reorient the EHEA. There are therefore still opportunities for higher education practitioners and policy makers at different levels to make their voices heard. This section of the books arising from the Bologna Researchers Conference provides a valuable contribution to this debate through three reasoned and well-researched contributions as well as, it is hoped, through this essay brining the section together. Rather than seeking to draw an overriding conclusion from three contributions that all stand on their own and that approach the âfuture of Bolognaâ from different angles, I would like to offer a ï¬nal thought from yet another angle. With the possible exception of âemployabilityâ, there is hardly a word that occurs as frequently in current education debate as âqualityâ. However, quality is more often than not presented as an established entity, something that is âout thereâ and all we have to do is strive for it and preferably achieve it. However, it makes little sense to assess whether we do something well unless we know what we are trying to do in the ï¬rst place. The quality debate may be rich in describing ways of reaching and not least measuring quality, but it is surprisingly divorced from considerations of what purposes education should serve (Bergan 2005; Council of Europe 2007, 2012). Consideration of the link between higher education reform and the broader purposes of higher education has also been subdued in the development of the EHEA. This is not to say it has been absent. The EHEA builds on a set of values that comprise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and student participation, and several communiquÃ©s refer to the multiple purpose of higher education. Nevertheless, a relaunch of the European Higher Education Area, intended to give higher education policy the place it deserves in European debate, but equally to give European societies the kind of higher education they deserve and that they need for their future developments, will require a much more sustained debate on the kind of Europe we would like to have and the kind of education we will need to achieve our goal. This debate will need to be philosophical and practical at the same time, since it will need to establish a clear connection between principles, policy, and practice. That will hopefully (re)motivate the higher education community, the policy making community, and our community tout court. It is the kind of debate to which the present author has sought to contribute (Bergan 2011) and to which the following quote from the Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul is highly relevant: And so I ï¬nd our education is increasingly one aimed at training loyal employees, even though the state and the corporations are increasingly disloyal. What we should be doing is quite different. It turns on our ability to rethink our education and our public expectations so that we create a non-employee, non-loyal space for citizenship. After all, a citizen is by deï¬nition loyal to the state because the state belongs to her or him. That is what frees the citizen to be boisterous, outspoken, cantankerous and, all in all, by corporatist standards, disloyal. This is the key to the success of our democracy (Saul 2009)."

117,181,0.959,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Conclusion In this chapter, I set out to explore in more detail the way in which daily wanting is worked upon in the context of unfolding sociomaterial interaction in residential dementia care, and I asked what we may learn about good care from taking a closer look at these practices. I stated that wanting is an expression of subjectivity, and being respected in this is a prerequisite for living a good life with dementia. At the same time, wanting something is a relational process. How it is acted upon thus is an ethical and political question. Nobody wants to constantly be overruled by another person, and indeed much work goes into avoiding coercing somebody. To describe what is done instead, I coined the term âsociomaterial will-workâ. The concept highlights care workersâ and residentsâ attempts to align the otherâs wanting with their own as a form of labour and as dependent on sociomaterial relations. I described care workers doing will-work by (1) sculpting moods and emotions, (2) managing attention and (3) creative negotiation involving time and materialities. With smiles, cups of hot chocolate and foot baths, changes to the order in which care is provided and to who shows up at a residentâs bed, care workers strive for a positive way of relatingâof being ânicely engagedâ in conversation and activity. Will-work ventures into the space between doing nothing and exerting force. It is the âurgingâ that care workers name when seeking alternatives for coercion and neglect. I have argued that this aligning residentsâ wanting makes the caregiversâ work good care. I have offered an alternative understanding of the willânamely as something that is âdoneâ in sociomaterial interaction, in which it can be aligned by making it relational. Indeed, instead of dismissing âdaily wantingâ of those living with dementia, my analysis enables thinking about it. At the same time, the finding that moods and the feeling body can be appealed to in care encounters and that materialities can be used in creative negotiation with residents, offers new ways of thinking about what good care may entail in situations in which residents want something that their care workers understand as ânot goodâ for them. As such, my contribution is one that can inform care practice."

Some of our biggest challenges are: â Stability - This is our number one priority. Our tests arenât as stable as we wished they were, and we have some flakiness at times. Our approach to improve this issue has been to tackle the most unstable tests first, disabling and fixing them. We are making some progress but we still have some tests (the ones in worst shape) that show a failure rate of around 13 % which is not that good. â Speed - The entire pipeline, from the first to the last step takes about 19 min. We are always concerned about this, because we donât want our pipeline to become a delivery bottleneck for our User stories, and as we grow our codebase, the number of regression tests keeps increasing.

Building on what was discussed above, the answer to the question âwhat do scientists want?â may seem obvious. They want to secure their claim to priority, and therefore they want to publish (and be the first to do so). But why, then, has scientific publishing evolved into such a complicated card game, involving multiple variations on the prisonerâs dilemma? To successfully address this question, we must take a psychoanalytic stance, because than we will realise that some less obvious meanings, some less praiseworthy associations are obfuscated by the standardised use of this term âto publishâ in university discourse. For instance the connotation that to âmake publishâ etymologically means to confiscate (by the public authorities). In other words, as soon as you publish, your intellectual property is turned into common property, and scientists may therefore be reluctant to give themselves away. As long as some material is unpublished (safely stored in a computer, or kept in a pli cachetÃ©) it is still yours. Another intriguing association, psychoanalytically speaking, is connected with this one, namely the pejorative sense of the Latin term publicare. A publica or publicus is actually a prostitute, someone who is at everyoneâs disposal. So, yes, there certainly are reasons for ambivalence or even reluctance when it comes to publishing your results or your ideas in academic journals. By making"
116,93,0.959,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Moral dissonance occurs when there is an absence of what Rawls (1971) calls reflective equilibrium. His assumption is that when we make moral judgments about a particular issue, we compare them with what we more generally consider morally right and wrong in such situations. We seek coherence between the moral beliefs about the particular situation and the general moral beliefs we have about how one ought to behave in such situations. The principle of equality guides us in reflections of this kind, as we try to achieve internal balance and equilibrium. When there is a breakdown in this attempt to reconcile the particular and the general, we can feel and experience moral dissonance. Temptation is not necessarily involved in moral dissonance. Participants in Milgramâs experiment on obedience to authority experienced an intense moral discomfort in obeying orders to inflict pain on another human being (Milgram 1963, 1974). They, too, faced moral dissonance, a clash between their moral convictions and the moral aspect of what they were ordered to do. Who are the people who normally experience moral dissonance? In teaching sessions, Nigel Krishna Iyer and I have approached this question by placing them in the middle between two kinds of people who are not bothered by this particular kind of cognitive dissonance:  The moral saint: A person who hardly ever does anything morally"

Giving in to this thought could make him feel somewhat paranoid from time to time, but he decided not to be deterred by a mere suspicion of surveillance. In these cases, it remains ambiguous how pervasive the surveillance effort was, and also whether regime agents wanted us to know they were monitoring us, or tried to be subtle. While there may be exceptions, we should assume that in an authoritarian context, critical journalists and activists are likely to be under (online and/or offline) surveillance to some degree, and there is a good possibility that we as researchers may come under the radar if we contact them, even if we never notice it. None of this was ambiguous when our Morocco researcher was investigating human rights abuses committed againstâreal or supposedâSalafists. Soon after her meeting with relatives of Salafi prisoners (detailed below), she was conducting an interview in an otherwise empty coffee house, and two people came to sit at the next table, pretending to read a newspaper but clearly listening in to the interview. During the next two days, she was continually being followed. A man sat down next to her in a nearly empty train. She moved to another seat, but again she was followed. When she got out of the train, he was still there. When she arrived at the airport, the same person was in the queue behind her, but then magically appeared in front of her after security control. This was surveillance intended to intimidate, and it did. For reasons detailed below, the Morocco researcher nevertheless returned to Morocco, but this time prepared a number of safety measures, making arrangements to meet friends at the airport, informing the Italian embassy of what she was doing, and asking for official permission to do the research. Faced again with intrusive surveillance, she met a friend at a coffee bar and, again with a security agent in a nearly empty cafÃ© as audience, told her friend that she had no interest in the Salafi research; she was just doing it because she needed the money, her real interest was in womenâs rights. When for months her request for authorization remained âin processâ, she acted according to her own stated intentions, and gave up the research on Salafists. She experienced some more surveillance, but as it became increasingly clear that she was no longer following this line of inquiry, the surveillance melted away. She had encountered a red line (see Chap.3) and has chosen not to cross it again."

118,716,0.958,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"21.6 Discussing the Fukushima Daiichi Catastrophe Other chapters in this book convey the experience of planning and hosting the summer school. The week in August 2011 was eye-opening in so many ways. The students showed an unusual willingness to play along with an experiment that went against much of their previous training. Social scientists are used to deeply unresolvable problems; in fact, we often take pleasure (at least the academics among us) in societal complexity and the absence of a single right answer. Our summer school attendees remarked on their bewilderment: how to chart a course through the thicket of conflicting perspectives and options. To my mind, the most compelling parts of the summer school were not about contentâthe lectures by experts, the formulation of problems to be tackled, or even the conclusions that the student teams articulated on the last day. What was most impressive was the process, how it all unfolded. The organizers and discussion leaders managed to make space for future engineers to speak analytically and non-defensively about the failures that led into the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. It was not out of line to talk about the ânuclear villageââand also to subject that concept to some pretty stringent critique. Some students found a voice to speak from their own experience in ways that I doubt they would have tried in a regular NE classroom. Several said that whatever the caveats attached to formal projections of risk, they had never believed that an accident of this sort could actually happen. And now that it had happened, it could happen again. It also took deliberate social engineering to make room for open-ended discussions. Along with turning off the video camera (documenting for the purpose of Japanese reporting to funders) and a no-powerpoint rule for final presentations, it made a difference that we were in a setting outside the classrooms in Etcheverry, in downtown Berkeley, near several bars. It is tempting to live out of the inspiration of the summer school and to present it in the reporting language of demonstrated success. And yet I do not think of it as a straight-ahead model for future educational programs, at least not in this oneshot form. Asking the students to do little preparation, in a week of lectures and Q&A we could only get so far. When we made our way past the initial technical presentations to take up societal issues, it was not clear that social scientists were seen as having anything different to offer from engineers speaking in the same vein. And in the student discussions, inevitably, the content of âsocial scienceâ"

She questioned the ânaturalâ when she examined working conditions in different global regions. Boserup led the way in contextualising the division of labour as socially and culturally constructed, although she used different terminology at that time. I will return in the next section to the way she perceived the âstatus of womenâ. In the livelihood approach, we must consider all the work that is required within a community and its household units to organise daily survival strategies. Thus, we need a more holistic view that bears in mind that the activities for peopleâs livelihoods include more than the productive sphere, which is the focus of some narrow economic approaches.

She is particularly interested in the employeeâs social skills. âDoes he function well with his colleagues?â she asks. If Ben gives an honest answer, he is likely to be stuck with the employee for a long time. If he is vague about the employeeâs social skills, he may get rid of a problem. He then runs the risk that his honesty will come up for questioning later. It also feels wrong to lie to another person in order to get rid of a problem at work. Lying in this case would be an attempt to transport oneâs own problem over to someone else, instead of taking responsibility and deal with it in oneâs own organization. How should Ben respond to the question about the employeeâs social abilities? Ben must choose between being honest about an employeeâs antisocial behaviour and telling the truth, an option that seems guaranteed to block the employeeâs move to another organization. Like Anne, he acknowledges that whatever he decides to do, something will be wrong. At first glance, it can appear to be an obvious example of a false dilemma. Ben can choose between honouring the moral value of being truthful to others, or giving priority to a selfish need to get rid of a human resource management problem. We can understand that it is tempting to withhold information and thereby help the difficult employee on his way to a new job, but doing so would violate the moral duty to be honest in business dealings. Ben might reason that the employee deserves another chance in a new work environment. If he can open a new page in his career, he might blossom and be better able to fulfil his personal and professional potential. That is all very well, but these considerations seem weak and constructed to camouflage a violation of a moral requirement to be straightforward and honest as a reference person. The extent to which Benâs situation is a real or a false dilemma will depend on the details of the case. I have used the case as a starting point both for ethical teaching of business managers and business school students, as well as for research in moral psychology, where the purpose has been to map the extent to which the situation creates moral dissonance and gets managers to engage in moral neutralization activities (Kvalnes, 2014). I return to that topic in Chapter 11. The participants in ethical training have conveyed their experiences from being on both sides of the table under circumstances where one party is strongly tempted to keep silent about the negative features of a person applying for a job. Some have been untruthful as reference-persons. Among those, some have lived to regret it because the choice has backfired. DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0004"

In the spring of 2006 I was asked by an Austrian university professor to find a tour guide for a group of political science students from Vienna visiting Mostar on a study trip. I thought the students would benefit most from a tour covering both the east and west sides of the city. Armen, an elderly Bosniak man introduced in Chap. 4, who had grown up in Mostar and possessed seemingly infinite knowledge about its history was my first choice as tour guide for East Mostar. Darko, a young Mostarian, agreed to show the students West Mostar where he lived with his family. Back then, Darko was in his penultimate year at Stara gimnazija, the same grammar school Lejla also attended. I was happy about Darkoâs offer to help, especially as I hoped the relative small age difference between him and the students would make it easy to engage everyone in a post-tour conversation over lunch. Though I knew the sites we were visiting and had read and heard about them before, it was very interesting to see how Armen and Darko respectively presented their city to the foreign students. It was not particularly surprising how much Armenâs and Darkoâs tours differed. I knew (from conversations and a previous tour) that Armenâs knowledge of Mostarâs history was extensive, to say the least. Unsurprisingly, Darko did not have the same historical knowledge if for no other reason than his younger age. Still, his tour (after Armenâs seemingly endless and detailed explanations) was, I suppose, refreshing for everyone. However, what struck me about Darkoâs guided tour was his effort to depoliticise all spheres of life that touched upon his own personal life. In order to discuss the discursive tactics inherent in Darkoâs narrative, I give a short account of the tour he gave us. The first site Darko decided to show the students was the modern shopping mall at Rondo, the central roundabout in West Mostar. He proudly presented this piece of âmodernityâ in his city that otherwise was still heavily marked by its destruction. Darkoâs tour soon revealed which places he thought to be presentable and which not; oftentimes these places did not correspond with the foreign studentsâ ideas of places of interest. This was the case when the students said they wanted to visit the biggest Partisan memorial in the city which, ironically, is located on"

The first is to keep the one-dimensionality, but to look at loops rather than chains: this would take us to the second horn of Sellarsâs dilemma, where knowledge is pictured as Kundalini swallowing its own tail. The other way is to give up one-dimensionality altogether and to study multi-dimensional networks. This would take us to the coherentist caucus in epistemology, or rather to an infinitist version of it, in which ultimately the network stretches out indefinitely in infinitely many directions. It might seem that such a version will be especially vulnerable to the standard objection to coherentism, according to which coherentist networks of knowledge hang in the air without making contact with the world. Indeed, as Richard Fumerton noted, if we worry about âthe possibility of completing one infinitely long chain of reasoning, [we] should be downright depressed about the possibility of completing an infinite number of infinitely long chains of reasoningâ.2 Remarkably enough however, the opposite is the case. Since the connections between the propositions in the network are probabilistic in character, we are dealing with conditional probabilities. As we explained in Section 4.4, the conditional probabilities together carry the empirical thrust, and this is even more so in a multi-dimensional system than in a structure of only one dimension, for the simple reason that now there are more conditional probabilities that may be linked to the world. Extending the chains to networks thus enables us to catch it all: to develop a form of coherentism which not only is infinitist, but also acknowledges the foundationalist maxim that a body of knowledge worthy of the name must somehow make contact with the world.3 We start in Section 8.2 by discussing one-dimensional loops. We will see that, if justification is interpreted probabilistically, then it is in general un2 Fumerton 1995, 57. 3 Thus we do not have many quibbles with William Roche when he argues that"

For her, the only possible escape was to find employment outside the home (Diana, born 1976, interviewed by Lambrini Styliou, 1 April 2005). Work ( puna) is an all-important part of Albanian womenâs lives. Regardless of their degree of job satisfaction, work in Greece guarantees a certain extent of autonomy that they do not have at home. Especially women from a rural background, employment in another womanâs home, in spite of the âfemaleâ character of the work, is an empowering experience (Kofman et al. 2000, p. 123). For village women who used to work in the fields, work back home did not count as work, as it was considered to be part of their domestic chores. Domestic work is transformed into remunerated labour in Greece with fixed working hours and wages.17 In their narratives, it is not working skills or pride that appear as core values, but money. It is their money which they can spend according to their own criteria and which allows them to free themselves from the moral standards of their village community, for example, by buying modern, âfeminineâ clothes. In this sense, they considerably value the working experience. In contrast, educated urban women who exercised a profession in Albania view their work in Greece as a downgrading and humiliating experience. They feel trapped in a closed labour market that does not offer them opportunities to practise their skills, owing to the ethnic division of labour. Their narratives convey a strong sense of insecurity, which is linked to the impossibility of their joining the Greek health insurance system independently and thereby obtaining an autonomous residence permit. Therefore, they remain legally dependent on their husbands. Yet even for these educated women, waged labour remains a major pathway to independence and to self-respect. Andrina, who studied economics in Albania and agreed to marry a Greek man through an arranged marriage (they met for the first time at the border), criticized her own decision to marry a man she did not love in order to settle down and become a housewife: I got fed up with being a housewife.â¦ I said to myself, my life is not only to wash up the dishes, to cook the meal. I had other interests, about society. I got involved with educational programmes, with womenâs associations. But most of all I wanted to work, to be independent. And that is what I tell other women. Donât seek a âconvenientâ marriage. Try to find a job first, to be independent and then you can decide to marry. (Andrina, born 1965, interviewed by Raymond Alvanos, 4 February 2006)"

The BlackBerry remained a preferred device for some participants, in some cases operating alongside other brands such as Nokia and Samsung. One of the NGO activists reported a particularly complex device strategy in which the more familiar strategy of separating family and work contacts was approached rather differently: Facilitator: [Scripted question]. What apps do you have on your phone? NGO activist: WhatsApp, Line, WeChat. Initially I had a Fleksi phone [i.e. CDMA handset]. Then I bought a BlackBerry and Android. Now I use all three.

The PLWHA buddy also reported a multi-device strategy with a preference for social networking over voice and SMS: PLWHA buddy: I use two phones, a Nokia and a BlackBerry.

137,68,0.958,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Adam stayed home for quite a long period of time and experienced how having the sole responsibility could be exhausting, but at the same time fantastic. He had to focus on the childâs needs and not on himself as he used to do before. It took 8 weeks before he felt he could relax a bit, which gave him a better understanding of the work and responsibility that his wife had experienced. When we ask if he was pleased that he acquired this insight into how his wife might have experienced her year at home with the baby, he said: âYeah, totally, and I tried to say that to friends too.â He had learned from being home alone: âI was a bit back to the old ways too. Thinking âokay, Siri has to take a bit more than me.â Changing the nappies and stuff, but nowâ¦ Before I probably would have argued about changing the nappy, now I just do it. So, it was a really good experience.â He accepted that this was a responsibility that they shared and did not bother to negotiate with his wife about whose turn it was to change the nappies. Thus, his previous understanding of care work had been challenged, and he had changed his practices towards more equal parenting. We noticed the same experience with many of the other fathers who compared care work to having physically demanding jobs, and who became much more tired from being home. This also makes them think about the mother and the work she does when staying at home. Through experiencing both types of work, they are able to recognize the heavy workload that mothers have, as well as commenting on how unfair this division of work between parents has been. Steinar is a 33-year-old graduate engineer married to Anna, a pre-school teacher. They had two daughters, one who was two and a half and the other 4 months when we interviewed him. He stayed home alone with the oldest daughter when he had his fatherâs quota of 12 weeks. Because the family moved to a new flat shortly after he started on his leave period, he really had two different experiences while staying at home. He started out thinking that he would have ample time for himself, that care work would mean pleasant times and that he might even be a bit bored. Nevertheless, he was warned by his more experienced friends that he would have little spare time. During his period at home, he experienced two phases. He followed his friendsâ advice in the first phase and focused on only being there for the child, which he called his âgood fatherâs quotaâ period: âAnd it was â¦ it was just as I had envisioned. Bliss, really. It was so nice, and peace and lots of cosy times with the baby.â He talks about his experiences in the following way: Sure, you think youâll have oceans of time with a pleasant â¦ and almost boredom. And thatâs where you go wrong. The funny thing is that I was told by I donât know how many friends whoâd been there, done that, that âDonât plan. Donât think youâll be able to do"

Or maybe the answer to âwhen is deathâ is never, if our telomeresâthe part of human cells that affect how we ageâcan be manipulated in just the right way. But the essays in this volume, as well as this Afterword, suggest that little has really changed from very long ago. To be dead is still not to breathe againâeverâand this prognosis is not very hard to make accurately within minutes or hours of its coming to pass. Anyone who has lost someone they love can attest to this. The dead by this standard are gone in almost an instance. Brain death is a distraction from this very basic fact. And the dead still do a great deal for us, individually and collectively, as they have always done. âBecoming really dead,â as I wrote elsewhere âtakes timeâ.6 âNever, never, never, never, neverâ to return to the living as voices, bodies, or ghosts can take years and years, sometimes centuries and millennia."
309,126,0.958,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"Here I should add that the male teacher was a notorious womanizer. Whenever I met him in public, those present at the meeting would tell me later about his intimate relationships with his (high school) students. They were very critical of him not only because of the students but also because they felt angry and ashamed by the way he treated his wife, who was well aware of her husbandâs exploits, and was hurt and upset. I was told several times that he was dÃª (goat, i.e., horny), and between me and my teacher, we nicknamed him âMr. dÃªâ. Oddly enough âMr. dÃªâ insisted that we ordered cÃ  ri dÃª. It was also odd, however, that the female teachers, his spouse included, were all eager to try the dish. My understanding was that this was a chance to try this kind of meat in a setting that was socially acceptable or, at least, not male and sex oriented, but rather a place that offered exotic and odd food, where everyone could pretend that no transgression was going on. The event, however, became tense once we ordered the goat curry, with our guests becoming quiet, carefully biting into the goat meat and looking at each other with what seemed to me a combination of fear and embarrassment. The tension eased only once the main course were cleared and we turned to order desserts. My experience with goat meat in these different settings suggested that this was one salient example of ambiguous culinary transgression. In Hoi An, goat meat was attributed with male potency. It was served in specializing restaurants that catered to men. The meat was either roasted, condensing and augmenting the potency it embodied, or cooked in a broth that ensured that every bit of it was consumed to the fullest. Goat blood and testicles, the essence of its masculinity, were consumed in rice liquor, further increasing the potential masculinity consumed by the diners. Restaurants that served goat meat catered only to men and any woman present was perceived as a legitimate target for sexual approach, exploitation, and abuse, as we realized when such comments were made at our female companions. Goat meat was perceived by my Hoianese friends as tempting yet problematic. Men were eager to consume it so as to enhance their masculinity. Yet both women and men agreed that this was not the fare appropriate for normative people under normal circumstances. Women were especially critical and deterred from goat meat and the places that served it, but they too were willing (perhaps eager) to try it"

LaTeX is the lingua franca of mathematicians and statisticians: whenever you want to describe an equation in text (e.g., in an email), you write it as a LaTeX equation. Since many reports are produced using both R and LaTeX, it might be useful to be able to automatically convert mathematical expressions from one language to the other. Because we need to convert both functions and names, this mathematical DSL will be more complicated than the HTML DSL. Weâll also need to create a âdefaultâ conversion, so that functions we donât know about get a standard conversion. Like the HTML DSL, weâll also write functionals to make it easier to generate the translators. Before we begin, letâs quickly cover how formulas are expressed in LaTeX."

However, it is somewhat annoying to have a function that is completely silent when it works â are we sure all things are properly computed? During development it is therefore highly recommended to insert a print statement such that we can monitor the calculations and be convinced that the test function does what we want. Since a test function should not have any print statement, we simply comment it out as we have done in the function listed above. The trapezoidal method can be used as alternative for the midpoint method. The derivation of a formula for the double integral and the implementations follow exactly the same ideas as we explained with the midpoint method, but there are more terms to write in the formulas. Exercise 3.13 asks you to carry out the details. That exercise is a very good test on your understanding of the mathematical and programming ideas in the present section."
51,273,0.958,How Generations Remember,"Minelaâs narrative is full of ambivalence towards Yugoslavia. As we have seen, she speaks highly of Yugoslaviaâs progressiveness and the multinational coexistence it enabled and nurtured. She emphasises that people were all the same and that most people did not care about the nationality of their compatriots. She claims that only the Bosniaks have kept this spirit while the others in the Mostar context (referring primarily to Croats) have tried to distinguish themselves from the others. Despite this positive view of Yugoslavia and her values, Minela simultaneously argues that multinationality is dangerous when it affects personal spheres like marriage because it leads to loss of identity. When she says, âI believe that this war had only one positive outcome: that we are no longer ashamed of ourselvesâ; she is referring to the strengthening of the Bosniak identity as a consequence of the war. We find both contrary discourses present in Minelaâs narrativeâabout the sameness of people and about a primordial national difference that one cannot and should not attempt to overcome. On the one hand, we could reason that the ambivalences found in her narrative are connected to the ambivalent position Bosniak political elites hold (see Chap. 3). To a certain extent this may be true but I argue that this ambivalence is characteristic for the Last Yugoslavs regardless of their nationality. This will become clear with Å½eljko, a Croat informant. As discussed earlier in the book, the present dominant Croat public discourse condemns Yugoslavia much more openly than the Bosniak one does. Å½eljkoâs positive memories of Yugoslavia thus disturb the negative picture of Yugoslavia that he ideologically supports."

Thus a grant proposal crossing disciplines A and B is likely to be reviewed by an expert on A and an expert on B â neither of whom is necessarily likely to feel favourably towards the other, nor towards the interdisciplinary proposal as a whole. Below, in providing examples of peer reviewer comments we have received on some of our interdisciplinary grant applications, we dwell on what such comments might tell us about the possibility â or impossibility â of intervening in the field of interdisciplinary research on the mind and brain. The quotation that begins this section comes from our first example. With some of our neuroscientific collaborators, we had proposed to run a series of brain-imaging experiments whose design would not be specified in advance, but which would emerge iteratively from a series of interdisciplinary workshops that we would run. This got short shrift: âIn my field (scientific and medical neuroimaging)â, one reviewer wrote, âit is imperative to describe the proposed experiment in detail, e.g. paradigms, number and type of subjects, analysis plan ... . I did not feel sufficient information was provided to indicate the quality of outputs.â Here, we rub up against keenly guarded disciplinary norms surrounding robust research. But if this neuroscientist found our proposed experiment too loose and underspecified, another reviewer (likely someone from the social sciences) found it too concrete: our proposal demonstrated a ânaÃ¯ve realism about the experiment and its ambitions for experimental convergence ... [while the] ambition to establish a more general protocol to be followed by others is epistemically naÃ¯ve and unreflexively normativeâ. The broader problem becomes clear here: try to design an interdisciplinary experiment that puts together the empirical rigour of neuroimaging and the conceptual openness of the humanities, and there is a good chance that you will be condemned by neuroscientists for your ambiguity, and by humanities scholars and/or interpretive social scientists for your empiricism. In a second example â from a peer review of a different grant application â we were informed that while our project had âpotentialâ, we should not only do more to test our proposed approach (presumably prior to applying, again, for funds), but specifically provide âevidence of potential to engage neuroscientists in a reciprocal relationshipâ. The reviewers did not see sufficient evidence of âreal collaboration with the community [we were] targetingâ. Note, first, how the injunction to engage our targeted community (âneuroscientistsâ) betrays the assumed direction of travel: it seems inconceivable, for example, that the field might be too entangled"
56,145,0.958,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"Despite the lack of data, observers on the ground tend to observe the same types of illness affecting older hostel residents. These include: problems relating to eyesight, hearing, dental health, rheumatology, arthritis, back pain, cardio-vascular disease, gastro-enterology, urinary infections, and respiratory disease (Adoma 2007; Aftam 2006; Migrations SantÃ© 2003; Sonacotra 2005). The range of illnesses experienced by residents, therefore, is no different to the rest of the elderly population (Unafo 2002). Dr. Ismail (geriatric doctor) confirmed that âitâs more or less the same schema as everywhere else in the worldâ, listing (i) cardiovascular conditions (high blood pressure, heart attacks) and (ii) âdisabilityâ linked to work accidents (back and knee pain). However there are a few specificities in hostel residentsâ health which are noteworthy. Firstly, health professionals observe a general degradation in health which afflicts hostel residents over the age of 55.3 As Anne-Marie, a crisis social worker at a hospital in the northern Paris suburbs, put it, â[those in the hostels] have let a whole load of things slide (â¦) there is a whole list of factors which bring them to hospital, generally they donât arrive for just one thing only.â Residents themselves are conscious of a certain decline in terms of health. The words of Saleem (60, Tiznit, Morocco) are characteristic in this regard: It's fine, I'm in good health, but each time I feel a negative side (â¦) I went to see the doctor, he gave me the treatment [for a prostate problem], but I don't know â what it might become or if it is going to become another illness, you just don't know.

All of our Asian interviewees mentioned business as the main reason for their move. As explained by Tilly (2007 [1993]) and NyÃ­ri (2010) their migration was supported by extremely strong transnational ethnic bonds; the final decision to migrate to a given country is generally initiated and supported by relatives or acquaintances already settled in the target country. On arrival many of our interviewees knew nothing about Hungary or Budapest in general or about KÅbÃ¡nya or JÃ³zsefvÃ¡ros in particular, except for the existence of the Four Tigers Market: this is hyper-localized transnational migration from a specific Chinese region to a specific area in Budapest. A common practice among first-wave migrants was to leave their children in China and send for them a few years later when the circumstances were appropriate. Before I came here, I did not know anything about Hungary, but my parents said âcomeâ, and now we are here.

The interpretations of dignity that this short excerpt point to are already quite diverse.

This book aims to illuminate the concept of dignity in the 21st century.2 What does it mean in the West? What does it mean in the Middle East? And could there be a common understanding?

I convened a press conference and stated that I would take full responsibility for any impropriety in the project.

13,203,0.958,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Other women with agrarian roots instead connect the question of gender equality to the asymmetries and injustices in the gender order of their childhood. Johanna, who married a farmer, says quietly that she thinks that too much hard work fell on women and that there should have been more cooperation between husband and wife. Had she been younger, she would have liked to have a job of her own outside the family. The strongest support for gender equality is found among the women who received a higher education or had wanted one. The combination of strong and kind mothers and distant fathers in the middle-class families seems to have produced fertile soil for supporting gender equality, even if they were not able to put it into practice in their own lives. Their focus is on the equal capabilities of women and men and on womenâs right to freedom of choice. Clara grew up in a community where most men were at sea and the women took care of things at home. She connects her positive attitude to gender equality today to her experience of strong women and an encouraging mother, but it was not a relevant issue when she was young: We were girls after all, and I thought I had quite a strong position as a young girl in my circles. So I didnât really think that it, I wasnât so concerned with"

Consider, in this light, the following first-person report: I needed to kill something in me, this awful feeling like worms tunneling along my nerves. So when I discovered the razor blade, cutting, if youâll believe me, was my gesture of hope. All the chaos, the sound and fury, the confusion and uncertainty and despair â all of it evaporated in an instant and I was for that minute grounded, coherent, whole. Here is the irreducible self. I drew the line in the sand, marked my body as mine, its flesh and its blood under my command.9 It is a harrowing indictment of our society that women suffer such adversity, trauma and abuse, and are possessed of so few genuine or perceived alternative options, that they choose to be violent towards themselves as a way of coping with and expressing their experience. Unlike violence towards others, we do not typically view self-directed violence as morally wrong, nor, since the legalization of suicide, is it criminalized.10 But it does violate a basic tenet of any broadly liberal society, which is that respect and equality are ideally due to all persons, irrespective of who they are.11 The very universality of this tenet means that, from each of our perspectives, it must apply not only to others but also to ourselves. Women who self-harm seem not to treat themselves with the respect and equality that, given this ethical outlook, they along with all other persons are due. Situating self-harm within its psycho-socio-economic context can help explain why women treat themselves and their bodies with such disregard and brutality: part of the explanation is that this may be how they and their bodies have been treated by others. Effectively and ethically addressing self-harm therefore has two interwoven facets. One facet looks to the rational agency of the self-harmer herself, and the need to support and empower her to choose self-care over self-harm. The other facet looks to the context of suffering, adversity and oppression in which women are situated, and the need to change the ways they are treated in wider society and the options available to them."

217,2,0.958,Finite Difference Computing With Pdes : a Modern Software Approach,"understanding of all details involved in the model and the solution method. Everybody nowadays has a laptop and the natural method to attack a 1D heat equation is a simple Python or Matlab program with a difference scheme. The conclusion goes for other fundamental PDEs like the wave equation and Poisson equation as long as the geometry of the domain is a hypercube. The present book contains all the practical information needed to use the finite difference tool in a safe way. Various pedagogical elements are utilized to reach the learning outcomes, and these are commented upon next. Simplify, understand, generalize The bookâs overall pedagogical philosophy is the three-step process of first simplifying the problem to something we can understand in detail, and when that understanding is in place, we can generalize and hopefully address real-world applications with a sound scientific problem-solving approach. For example, in the chapter on a particular family of equations we first simplify the problem in question to a 1D, constant-coefficient equation with simple boundary conditions. We learn how to construct a finite difference method, how to implement it, and how to understand the behavior of the numerical solution. Then we can generalize to higher dimensions, variable coefficients, a source term, and more complicated boundary conditions. The solution of a compound problem is in this way an assembly of elements that are well understood in simpler settings. Constructive mathematics This text favors a constructive approach to mathematics. Instead of a set of definitions followed by popping up a method, we emphasize how to think about the construction of a method. The aim is to obtain a good intuitive understanding of the mathematical methods. The text is written in an easy-to-read style much inspired by the following quote. Some people think that stiff challenges are the best device to induce learning, but I am not one of them. The natural way to learn something is by spending vast amounts of easy, enjoyable time at it. This goes whether you want to speak German, sight-read at the piano, type, or do mathematics. Give me the German storybook for fifth graders that I feel like reading in bed, not Goethe and a dictionary. The latter will bring rapid progress at first, then exhaustion and failure to resolve. The main thing to be said for stiff challenges is that inevitably we will encounter them, so we had better learn to face them boldly. Putting them in the curriculum can help teach us to do so. But for teaching the skill or subject matter itself, they are overrated. [18, p. 86] Lloyd N. Trefethen, Applied Mathematician, 1955-."

The menâs road to gender equality could initially be said to have been less personal, for instance, more connected to gender equality politics at their jobs. However, their increased presence in childcare and their experience of strong attachments to their children gradually also gave them a personal engagement. This seems to be the most important emotional link to gender equality for men in this generation, but it came later than that for the women. There is a time lag, but also partly a different agenda: for the men, gender equality is a care project, while for the women, it is a project of sharing more equally both care and domestic work. For the radical women, it also entails being involved against the sexualisation and objectification of the female body. For the men, the experience of being more actively participating fathers raises the question of gender equality from the menâs perspective, especially in connection with divorce and child custody. In the account of Egil, we can see how the intensity increases as he moves from talking about womenâs rights at work to menâs rights after divorce: Girls can do a lot of jobs just as well as boys, and I guess I think there should be gender equality in that regard and that there should be equal pay for equal work. I think that. But I donât think one should strive towards becoming the same. I think there should be differences between boys and girls. And if weâre talking about these things, what annoys me the most about the things to do with gender equality: those girls whoâve worked hard to show the places theyâve been treated unfairly, but theyâve probably been aware of places where men have been treated unfairly too. But I donât think many women have fought for that, in the situation of separation and divorce. Itâs clear who the loser is there. I donât think many of those working with gender equality have cared about that.

With blue and white walls, giving it a Nordic Scandinavian feel, the mansion was still uninhabited. Some carers had cut out a few paper fish for decoration, some of which were already dangling from the roof. Next door, the former brickyard was being rebuilt into a day-care centre. âThe idea is that the residents will be able to join some of their activities once itâs finishedâ, Matt declared. âThis ought to offer them some more activities, while at the same time relieve the carers in the village.

In coming to understand their project, the authors set themselves against a recent, high-profile account of collaboration (between natural scientists and social scientists) gone wrong, by Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett (Rabinow and Bennett 2012). Whereas Rabinow and Bennett had argued for rather more frank speaking in highly-charged interdisciplinary spaces, DF and his colleagues suggested, in deliberate contrast, that: [our] success might have come precisely because we did not speak frankly; we did not seek the truth; we totally failed to acknowledge â let alone discuss â the consequences of our experimental situation. What we did, instead, was to try to work and live within a zone that was just about ambiguous enough to keep everything together â that was sufficiently averse to frank-speaking to keep the worst of the resentments at bay.

Without the Educator, there would be no reflection on what is happening or, more importantly why it is happening. The Educator introduces reason and structure into what is happening and connects history with the present in order to show options for the future. During our research, we were fortunate enough to meet a handful of these community members who have become role models in Kenyaâs international technology sector. It is impossible to draw up a conclusive list that does justice to all of them, but this short list combines tremendous wisdom with a strong sense of community that Ken Njoroge, Mike Macharia, Joseph Mucheru, Isis Nyongâo, Carey Eaton,19 Jimmy Gitonga, Ory Okolloh, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich, and Bitange Ndemo all share in common.

This time around, the father was able to survive only 2 years in Turkey and went back to Bulgaria in 2008, his wife following shortly afterwards. GÃ¼lcanâs brother and his wife stayed on until 2010, but they too recently left for Bulgaria, although the bride wants to come back to Turkey and they are undecided as to where they will settle. GÃ¼lcan herself is adamant about staying, even if that means she will be without papers. But this does not necessarily mean she is committed to staying for good: First let me get my papers and then we will see. I cannot entirely give up on Bulgaria, either. For us, there is always going back and forth, we can never say, âthis is it, I am settled for goodâ. Migration is a part of our lives.

We may still put anonymity on the table as an option, especially if we do not know in advance exactly how the interview is going to go, but we do not usually expect them to take it up. These are public figures who are used to media exposure (albeit in the constrained circumstances of their authoritarian context), and in some cases, they may have already spoken of the same topics on public occasions. They will know exactly what they want to say to us, and how to say it. Moreover, their quotes are only meaningful in the context of who they are. What they say to us is interesting not because they give us insight into their thought process, or into the inner workings of the bureaucracy or the political process, but because they are the head of the Islamist Party or the president of the biggest womenâs rights association. These kinds of interviewees will often give their consent to be quoted by name in our published work as a matter of course, although they may also give us some off-the-record information at the same time. Even if they only give us their official views, this can be of interest, because they give us insight into authoritarian legitimation strategies.

As such, monitoring refers to looking for and utilizing feedback to reassess oneâs goal orientation, metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, and metacognitive choice in order to âmanageâ a changing environment (Haynie and Shepherd 2009: 700). Learning to Think Metacognitively Over the past decade, researchers have explored various instructional approaches that harness metacognition to improve reasoning (Kramarski et al. 2001). Mevarech and Kramarski (1997) created an instructional method to help students enhance their mathematical reasoning by developing their metacognitive skills through four types of questions based on (1) comprehension, (2) connection, (3) strategy, and (4) reflection (Mevarech and Kramarski 2003: 469). We refer to these questions as âmetacognitive questionsâ as they are used to stimulate learnersâ metacognition. First, comprehension questions are intended to encourage one to think about whether he or she really understands the nature of a particular problem before starting to address it. This understanding forms from carefully considering the situation such that one identifies a problem, its nature, and its implications. The following are examples of questions encouraging students to think about comprehension: What is the core of the problem? What is the key question asked? What meanings do the key concepts convey? Second, connection questions are intended to encourage students to think about a particular problem in terms of its similarities and differences with problems he or she has faced and solved before. These questions urge students to draw on existing knowledge and experiences without generalizing from them too much. Questions like the following prompt learners to think about these connections: How can I relate this problem to problems I addressed previously? In what ways does this problem differ from those I worked on in the past, and how does it differ? Third, strategic questions are intended to encourage students to think about which strategies are most suitable for solving a problem and why. These questions urge learners to contemplate the what, why, and how underlying their approach to a problem. The following are examples of strategic questions: What is the strategy/tactic/principle best suited for me to address this problem? Why is this strategy/tactic/principle so particularly appropriate? How can I put together information I need for solving the problem? How can I realize the plan?"

After the dogmatist has given his answer, for example reason A1 , the sceptic will ask further: what is your reason for A1 ? In the end it will become clear that the dogmatist has only three options open to him, jointly known as âAgrippaâs Trilemmaâ: 1. He goes on giving reasons for reasons for reasons, without end. 2. He stops at a particular reason, claiming that this reason essentially justifies all the others that he has given. 3. He reasons in a circle, where his final reason is identical to his first. In the first case the justificatory chain is infinitely long, in the second case it comes to a halt, and in the third case it forms a loop. The sceptic is quick to point out that none of these options can be accepted as a justification for q. The first option is impossible from a practical point of view, since we are ordinary human beings with a restricted lifespan. Moreover, even if we were to live forever, continuing to give reason after reason, we would never reach the origin of the justification, since by definition the chain does not have an origin. The second option is also unsatisfying. For why do we stop at this particular reason and not at another? If we can answer this question, we have a reason for what we claimed is without a reason, so we actually did not stop the chain. And if we cannot answer the question, then stopping at this particular reason is arbitrary. The third option is likewise unacceptable, for 3 Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of scepticism.

Just recently his book Algerian Sketches was released post-mortem where he writes about Algeria, the Algerian conflict and his theories. Later on, Bourdieu found that much of the social mechanisms he had found among the Kabyle were present in all manners of other social contexts. Bourdieu was one of the foremost French thinkers of the late 1900s and had great influence on many humanist and social science disciplinesâmainly in Europe. Those who have not read his work consider his thinking to be post-modern, but strictly speaking, he is not of the deconstructive school. He saw himself as post-structuralist, which was partly an acknowledgement of structuralism, but which also showed that it was not as embedded in his thinking with the degree of rigidity normally imposed by structuralism. He has, for example, done extensive research in the fields of art, literature and even studied his peers, the professors in Paris as empirical material. Bourdieu might at times be hard to understand, but his theories are based strictly on empirical material which he then has generalised to theoretical systems. With the passage of time, he introduced new terms, for example the term field, which we will return to later on. For more than a decade, I myself have used and expanded Bourdieuâs theories and found that there is a case to state that they are valid for studies and practice regarding Military Operations as well. This text should be seen as an introduction of the theories into the military field, especially regarding the field of intelligence analysis. In military context, the theories can be used to make social patterns visible. If you have good empirical material and a good analysis, then you will be able to see how actors (collective as well as individual) relate to each other. In the end, one can be both able to predict what will happen (with a certain degree of certainty) and able to make the other part (enemy or not) behave in a certain way, without them knowing that you are manipulating them. I would like to underscore that this text is primarily focused on the theory and not the empirical aspect. It only serves as a way to exemplify the theory and show its usefulness in operational analysis. I recommend the bibliography at the end for those interested in the empirical events briefly explained in this text. It should be stressed that field theory is more of an object than a tool in the text. The text is primarily a tool for training, inspire primarily military officers how to use field analysis.

118,578,0.957,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"17.2.3 Greater Public Good and Rationality, by Denia Djokic, University of California, Berkeley In a society comprising many stakeholders, there is no consensus on the definition of the âgreater public good.â For the case of each stakeholder, this utilitarian construct is based on a certain combination of: information, misinformation, different ways of interpreting the same information, lack of information, and most of all, different value systems, some of which do not always fit into the neat frame of a traditional cost-benefit analysis. In student discussions at this summer school, we tried to delve deeper into the meaning and function of the cost-benefit analysis. We asked questions such as whether seemingly âirrational decisionsâ were merely a different framing of the same cost-benefit analysis, where different stakeholders (e.g., nuclear engineers in contrast to the public) simply weigh the risks and the benefits differently. There is no simple answer, and furthermore I have no doubt that the solution depends on much more than just âcommunicationâ between the stakeholders. A good first step, however, is to encourage this kind of thought among the population that has traditionally been a major influence in top-down decisions: the nuclear engineering community. All these insightful and fruitful discussions at the summer school made me wonder: why is it that we nuclear engineering students are not usually challenged to think this way? We seem to be well trained in our field, and yet there seems to be a very large gap in our education. Undoubtedly, nuclear engineering students from UC Berkeley and the University of Tokyo are well educated in the breadth and depth of the discipline. However, in my nuclear engineering graduate school training to date, I have found that we are groomed to be inside-the-box thinkers without the necessary training to understand nuclear issues holistically. To solve technical problems, we are taught to draw clear boundaries around a limited problem, because without a clear definition, you cannot find a solution. Despite the fact that this method of solving problems often breaks down when scaling up to societal levels, the rhetoric among nuclear"

In the House of Commons, Labour politician, Emrys Hughes, pointed out that force-feeding had been performed before the prisoner had displayed any signs of health deterioration from hunger. âIs he [John Maclay, Secretary of State for Scotland] aware that there are still in this country suffragettes who recall with horror experiences of this kind in prison?â, Hughes asserted, âis it not time that he took a definite line to stop this?â33 It later transpired that sewing sandbags had not actually been compulsory, although Pat later claimed that prison staff had failed to clarify this while she was hunger striking. In The Guardian, Labour politician, Judith Hart, asserted that the Scottish Home Departmentâs âinsistence that the tube-feeding to which Miss Arrowsmith was subjected was âartificial feedingâ and not âforcible feedingâ is absurd; it is only because Miss Arrowsmith did not resist that the feeding was not âforcibleâ.34 Emrys Hughes also wrote to The Guardian querying why prison doctors had felt a need to feed Pat âartificiallyâ before her hunger strike had started to endanger her health? Refuting suggestions that force-feeding was not a violent act when performed on a compliant patient, Hughes retorted âbut it does not follow from this that, while she was waiting for this twice-aday operation in the solitude of her cell, she did not suffer considerable strain and mental suffering knowing what was to come. Your view of this of course depends on what end of the rubber tube you are.â35 Adding to the debate, Owen Staley suggested that Patâs force-feeding was an effort to break the emotional will of a courageous, principled woman.36 Not all letters published in The Guardian were entirely supportive.

Leading A.I. developers, neuroscientists, and learning theorists like Ray Kurzweil have argued that peopleâs natural sense of curiosity, creativity, and experimentation drive learning. So rather than teach people to solve problems in a classroom, we will co-build companies with them. We will build to learn. A venture builder is an ideal mechanism for learning. Generally speaking, a venture builder is a company that creates companies. In our approach, we continuously evaluate and share quantitative and qualitative market data to clarify problems entrepreneurs might tackle, then partner with a potential chief executive officer (CEO) and cocreate an idea. Together, we study the market, prototype with customers, and refine our model until we find a fit and potential for scale. We do provide some starting capital, but our CEOs are expected to raise their own funds. Like most accelerators, we have distilled plenty of business-building methods and convened the best resources in the ecosystem. However, rather than run people through a linear, time-bound, task-oriented program where everyone launches a website at the same time, we create an environment where a team can quickly access a wide variety of resources to accelerate toward a broad objective. We create metrics for achieving productâmarket fit or traction or positive cash flow and then convene the right mix of support for that company to achieve its goal. In a way we are an institution of co-founders, multiplying our experience by convening the best of the ecosystem. If we are doing it right, we are increasing the level of start-up performance and generating more sustainable solutions for society.

In 1935, Martin Buber (1878â1965) published Der NÃ¤chste, a collection of four essays on what it means to relate to other human beings as neighbours by the Marburg philosopher and neo-Kantian Hermann Cohen (1842â1918). In the introduction, Buber discusses when and under what circumstances assistance should be provided to others (1935, p. 7). He defends the need for positive duties against the widely held view in philosophy that restricts ethical duties to the ancient dictum âDo no harmâ. This position generally holds action to be mandatory only in very exceptional cases (Conradi 2016, pp. 54â58). Even a philosopher like Arthur Schopenhauer, who saw compassion as the driving force behind ethical behaviour, believed that the need must be acute and the emergency dire before action is required (2005, p. 101). For contemporary philosophers following Schopenhauerâs lead, the main criteria for performing individual assistance are an expectation of a significant effect, a severe emergency, a limited duration of aid, and a minor effort required for assistance (Mieth 2012, p. 243). Buber focuses on two other aspects of positive duty: whether the recipient is a member of oneâs own collective and whether the recipient is spatially proximate. Buber emphasises that the person at the receiving end could be anyone and therefore no distinction should be made between neighbour, stranger, friend, acquaintance, and enemy. But he believes particular attention should be paid to any person who is within the helperâs immediate sphere: âBe loving to your fellow as to one who is like youâ, is written in the Scripture, and shortly thereafter, as if to avoid any misunderstanding at any time, through special highlighting: âBe loving to a stranger as to one who is like youâ. Rea, the fellow, is someone I am dealing with, whom I met just now, the human being so to speak, for whom I should be âconcernedâ at this moment, whether he is of my own people or a foreigner. I should, literally translated, âlove himâ: turn towards him tenderly, show him love, practice love; namely as someone who is âlike meâ: in need of love such as I, in need of an act of love of a rea like meâas I know it just from my own soul. That this is to be understood in this way arises from the words following the second sentence: âBecause youâve been strangers in the land of Egyptââ or, as it says more clearly elsewhere: âYou know the soul of the stranger,"

Kripke is right in that I could not possibly be a lion. Still, there is some reason for rejecting the principle that has just been stated.34 Take a couple of birds that makes it to a remote island. They are the beginning of a founder population which flourishes and, after a while, diverges so considerably from their mainland cousins that they could not mate with them any longer, so a new species was born. Are there any first members of the new species? According to the story just told, I should say that the first two birds on the island are good candidates. But they do not differ in any way from their direct ancestors on the mainland, so must they not belong to the same species as their ancestors do? My favorite account of the situation is this: If they had not founded the new population they would have belonged to the same species as their parents. But since they did, they donât. That is, in P1 they donât, which is supposed to be an alternative in which they were successful founders. They become the first members of a new species in retrospect, once the new species has developed. But once it has, it is true that the new species started with them and not any later. But take P2 in which they starve on the island without leaving any descendants. Clearly, in P2 they belong to the same species as their parents. So species membership is not an essential property, but may vary from possible world to possible world. So SMEP should not be a postulate of TPA+CS. Should we even say in retrospect that the founders changed species membership during their lifetime? Probably we should."

Confirmation bias is the tendency we have to notice and seek information that confirms our beliefs, and to be inattentive to information that provides us with reasons to change our beliefs. The phenomenon is well documented in research (Nickerson, 1998), and produces formidable challenges in many professions. Police investigators can make up their minds about which person has committed a crime, and only pursue and notice information that confirms that conclusion. Teachers can have preconceptions about the intelligence and abilities of their pupils, and fail to see upward and downward spirals in their developments. Researchers can be so satisfied with their hypotheses and explanations of phenomena that they become blind to glaring counterevidence and reasons to revise them. In these and other professions, knowledge about confirmation bias is part of the professional training. This is nevertheless a pervasive decision-making trap, and one that emphasizes the need to have communication climates where colleagues look out for each other and intervene when someone at work stubbornly holds on to one belief or viewpoint rather than revises it in the light of new and relevant information. The other psychological phenomenon that can slow down a process of identifying and addressing morally relevant aspects of behaviour in an organization is the bystander effect. Research on human behaviour in real situations and in experiments show that the greater the number of bystanders to an event where somebody needs help, the less likely is it that any one of them will actually help (Darley and LatanÃ©, 1968; Hudson and Bruckman, 2004). One cause for this effect seems to be that we consider responsibility to help in a situation to be one unit that we share evenly with the other people at the scene. If we are one hundred bystanders to a critical situation, we seem unconsciously to split responsibility into one hundred tiny pieces, leaving each of us with one hundredth of a responsibility to intervene and help. That is a very small piece of responsibility. If we instead are fifty bystanders, the responsibility is double that of in the previous situation, but one fiftieth of a responsibility is still very little. This way of thinking is what Derek Parfit labels mistakes in moral mathematics. We do have individual responsibilities to help, no matter how many others are present. It is unreasonable to consider responsibility to be one cake we share evenly into thin slices. Each has his or her own cake of responsibility. Another cause for the bystander effect is that each of us tend to interpret the inactivity of the others as a sign that nothing serious is going on, DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0014"
124,275,0.956,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"5 The Assertion Problem In âIndeterminism and the Thin Red Line,â Belnap and I described what we termed the Assertion Problem as an issue that needs to be faced by anyone who theorizes about thought and action directed toward an open future. The problem was as follows. It would seem that one can make assertions about what one knows to be an open future, and in particular about aspects of that open future that are not yet settled by what has transpired thus far. One can assert that the coin will land heads, knowing full well that, as we may now suppose, the coin-tossing process is a fundamentally indeterministic one. But in the absence of a TRL, it is difficult to see how we can provide truth values to such assertoric contents as âThe coin will land headsâ when one history branching out of the moment of utterance contains a moment on which the coin lands head, and another history branching out of the moment of utterance contains a moment on which the coin lands tails. Were we to posit a TRL, then we could think of it as privileging one of these histories as the one that will happen, and thereby give us a state of affairs that settles the truth of the future-directed assertion. Barring that, it is not clear how we might characterize the context of utterance, or the circumstances of evaluation in such a way as to tell us whether the assertion is true. The context of utterance might provide values for indexical expressions, but it is less clear how the context of utterance selects one history from among all those that might be how things go. The intuitive datum seems, then, to be twofold: one can (i) reasonably, and, (ii) felicitously, make an assertion about an aspect of the future that is ontically open and thus not settled by what has gone thus far."
259,108,0.956,The Little Book of Semaphores,"In the previous section, we addressed what Iâll call categorical starvation, in which one category of threads (readers) allows another category (writers) to starve. At a more basic level, we have to address the issue of thread starvation, which is the possibility that one thread might wait indefinitely while others proceed. For most concurrent applications, starvation is unacceptable, so we enforce the requirement of bounded waiting, which means that the time a thread waits on a semaphore (or anywhere else, for that matter) has to be provably finite. In part, starvation is the responsibility of the scheduler. Whenever multiple threads are ready to run, the scheduler decides which one or, on a parallel processor, which set of threads gets to run. If a thread is never scheduled, then it will starve, no matter what we do with semaphores. So in order to say anything about starvation, we have to start with some assumptions about the scheduler. If we are willing to make a strong assumption, we can assume that the scheduler uses one of the many algorithms that can be proven to enforce bounded waiting. If we donât know what algorithm the scheduler uses, then we can get by with a weaker assumption: Property 1: if there is only one thread that is ready to run, the scheduler has to let it run. If we can assume Property 1, then we can build a system that is provably free of starvation. For example, if there are a finite number of threads, then any program that contains a barrier cannot starve, since eventually all threads but one will be waiting at the barrier, at which point the last thread has to run. In general, though, it is non-trivial to write programs that are free from starvation unless we make the stronger assumption: Property 2: if a thread is ready to run, then the time it waits until it runs is bounded. In our discussion so far, we have been assuming Property 2 implicitly, and we will continue to. On the other hand, you should know that many existing systems use schedulers that do not guarantee this property strictly. Even with Property 2, starvation rears its ugly head again when we introduce semaphores. In the definition of a semaphore, we said that when one thread executes signal, one of the waiting threads gets woken up. But we never said which one. In order to say anything about starvation, we have to make assumptions about the behavior of semaphores. The weakest assumption that makes it possible to avoid starvation is: Property 3: if there are threads waiting on a semaphore when a thread executes signal, then one of the waiting threads has to be woken."

Whether an infinite regress of justification makes sense may very well depend on the meaning of justification. We have seen that under a particular interpretation of âx causes yâ or âx is smaller than yâ regresses may be harmless, whereas under an alternative interpretation they do not make sense. Something similar might well apply to the case of epistemic regresses, so it is incumbent upon us to consider what may be meant by âA j justifies Ai â. In doing so, we are not trying to give a definition of justification. Nor are we making any claim about its relation to knowledge. Traditionally, justification has been seen as a necessary ingredient of knowledge, as that which has to be added to true belief. Recently, different views have been put forward, such as that justification is a derivative of the primitive concept of knowledge, or is possible knowledge, or potential knowledge, or appearance of knowledge, or that it implies truth, or that justification and knowledge simply coincide.7 We will make no such claims. Everything we say about justification is meant as a contribution to the debate about the possibility of epistemic regresses, not to the debate about how to define knowledge or justification. Of course, the two issues are connected, but it would be a mistake to treat them as being on a par.8 Our aim, as said, is to find out to what extent infinite epistemic chains are possible. It will turn out that for this purpose it is enough to adopt a very modest and uncontroversial claim about justification; there is no need to define justification or to say how exactly it relates to knowledge."

Julietâs second death by stabbing is genuine and observed as such (the watchman pronounces her âbleeding, warm, and newly dead,/ Who here hath lain this two daysâ (5.3. 174â175)), but not all women in Shakespeareâs tragedies pass away so swiftly or evidently. A strange contrast to Julietâs case is that of Desdemona, smothered by her husband Othello in a jealous rage. In such a death, there are no immediately readable signs like Julietâs fresh blood, especially since, as Othello himself has observed earlier, Desdemona has âwhiter skin [â¦] than snow,/And smooth as monumental alabasterâ (Othello, 5.2.4â5). Even when she is alive and in good health, Othello imagines her as a dead figure like that on a stone tomb, perhaps to lessen his guilt for what he is about to do. Her physical self presents a dramatic contrast to Juliet, in whom, even when she is drugged and seemingly âdeadâ within a vault, Romeo notices that âBeautyâs ensign yet/Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeksâ (Romeo and Juliet, 5.3. 94â95). When Othello first smothers Desdemona, he does not fully succeed, and remarks as muchââNot dead? Not yet quite dead?â (Othello, 5.2.95)âcontinuing until he can pronounce firmly that âSheâs deadâ (5.2.100). But shortly afterwards, we discover that we cannot trust his reading of the external signs of mortality, when we hear her voice from behind the bed-curtains: âO, falsely, falsely murdered!â (5.2.126). Although we may initially conclude that she is a ghost, we soon realize that she has indeed revived, just for long enough to proclaim her innocence, and also to exonerate, rather than accuse, her husband. Her maid, Emilia, asks her âwho hath done this deed?â; Desdemonaâs final words are âNobody, I myselfâ (5.2.132, 134). Othello is not the only example in Renaissance drama where a suffocated woman temporarily revives. Shakespeareâs Jacobean contemporary John Webster (1580â1634) takes the idea even further: when the eponymous heroine of his play The Duchess of Malfi is strangled on the orders of her brother, she revives over a hundred lines after she has seemingly"

Drapes allowed this and the following week it was recorded she was âtaking her food betterâ.52 Because the provision of dietary fell within the realm of medical treatment, resident medical superintendents retained control over whether relatives could supply additional food articles. Although not explicitly prohibited by the Privy Council rules, at Enniscorthy, relatives were not allowed to provide luxuries. In 1877, the RMS, Edmundson, wrote to one paying patientâs daughter asking that she âmight please not bring Beef tea &c. to your father as he is supplied with everything we deem fit for him hereâ.53 At Richmond, relatives could supply extras. Hesta Wâs mother and friends brought her food, although she refused to accept it, believing it was poison.54 Patrick C. refused âvery nearly all the food supplied by the asylum, but takes freely whatever his brothers bring or send himâ. In this case, the patient declined to say why he refused the institutionâs food.55 The centrality of food within the case notes examined indicates the medical emphasis on good feeding as a facet of treatment. The frequency and similarity of patientsâ complaints recorded in the case notes, however, suggests that diet was one area where district asylum care did not meet paying patientsâ expectations. At Richmond, some campaigned for improved dietary standards. Walter J.H., formerly a staff sergeant in the army, wrote a letter to Norman after two of the other medical officers allegedly consented to his âmaking some suggestions for the improvement of the management of this establishmentâ. He pointed out that: the food as supplied to sick patients is not what it should be â Before I can draw up a good plan, I should require to see what facilities you have for cooking purposes â what arrangements are made to ensure cleanliness & what is done to prevent waste of unconsumed food. It appears to me that under the present regime waste is inevitable.

In the oldest generation it is seen as a female curse, something mothers and daughters are equally subjected to. But since it is not talked about, this does not lead to any closeness between mothers and daughtersâit is the silent and unwelcome sign of womanhood. In the middle generation the menstruating female body is also felt as a negative thing, but is taken more as a fact of life and even something that may contribute to some intimacy between girls. This may be surprising when seen in connection with the negative relationships to their mothers; however, it may also tell us about the basic care that these devalued mothers actually provided for their daughters, in addition to the decreasing taboo that came with more information about sexual reproduction.

Presumably, if helpfulness is not something you particularly treasure in others, you have no moral obligation to be helpful towards others. Kant meant the categorical imperative to be stricter than a hypothetical one in that it is universally binding for all rational beings, and not contingent upon individual or cultural differences. It seems that he considered the Categorical Imperative to be an improvement on the Golden Rule in the sense that it avoided subjectivity and added universality as a requirement of moral considerations. The principle of equality puts demands on the justification of choices. It requires that a decision-maker can back up a difference in treatment of two cases with an identification of a morally relevant difference between them, but does not single out one particular moral outlook or ethical foundation to be uniquely right. It does not favour duty ethics over utilitarianism, or vice versa, but remains neutral regarding the tension between them. As we saw in the discussion of the trolley problem, duty ethics considers the fact that a person is used as mere means to indicate that it is a morally unacceptable option, even though this option maximizes utility. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, considers consequences as the only morally relevant features of the situation, and thus comes to different conclusions about what to do. Both traditions acknowledge the principle of equality, but part company on the issue of what constitutes a morally relevant difference. Looking back on previous examples from this book through the lens of the principle of equality, we can see how the justifications can take the form of finding reasons to make exceptions in the application of ordinary moral norms. In the blackmail case, Anne can claim that she does not give in to blackmail or other kinds of pressure that can occur in a corrupt economy, but that she makes an exception in this case, due to the colossal economic stakes that are involved. In the reference case, Ben can argue that he normally is truthful towards others, but that he is making an exception in this case, since he needs to restore harmony in his unit, and can do so effectively by hiding truths about the employeeâs quarrelsome behaviour. In the second trolley case, a person can argue that he or she would normally not kill an innocent person, but that the current situation warrants an exception, since it is thereby possible to save five lives. Whether we accept these appeals to morally relevant differences depends on how well they fit with our moral convictions and beliefs. DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0007"

Most of it I hadnât any clue as to what was going on, but he did have us read a little Whitehead, and I really liked that a lot.

Putting it all together We have now described a representative subset of the different types of card which are used in the User Story Essentials practice, so we will not describe the other cards because the story will rapidly become familiar and repetitious (which is part of the value of using a simple, standard language to express all our practice guidance). Now we understand what all the cards mean, we also need to understand at a high level how the whole practice works. The cards themselves give us all the clues we need as to how the elements fit together to provide an end-to-end story â which activities progress and produce which elements, but it is also here useful to tell the joined-up story in terms of end-to-end flow through the different activities. â¢ First we need to Find User Stories. This brings one or more User Stories into existence in the initial Identified state, each documented by a Story Card with just enough information to ensure that the User Story has its Value Expressed. â¢ On a Story-by-Story basis, we will select a User Story that we wish to get done next, and use the Prepare a User Story activity to progress the User Story to be Ready for Development, which involves ensuring that we have the Acceptance Criteria Listed on the Story Card, and during which we may also get any supporting Conversation Captured. As part of this same activity we also fully elaborate the associated Test Cases. â¢ The final activity that this practice describes is how we work to Accept a User Story, the successful completion of which moves the User Story to the Done state. Notice that this âchainingâ of Activities primarily via the state of the things that they progress does not over-constrain the overall flow. It does not, for example, imply a single-pass, strictly sequential flow. We might, for example, iterate around the different activities for different User Stories in different ways. Exactly how may be further constrained as part of adopting other practices. For example, if we use the User Story practice in conjunction with Scrum, as is very common, we may agree the following general rules as a team: â¢ Do the Find User Stories before we start our First Sprint, but also allow this to happen on an ad hoc basis ongoing."
269,154,0.956,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"The familiar register of exhortations to interdisciplinarity â mutuality! reciprocity! exchange! â is one that assumes that differentials of power do not exist. And yet, for many people from the humanities and social sciences â and we are thinking quite beyond our own collaborations here â experiencing oneâs role in a collaboration with life scientists as a relatively powerless one undercuts these kinds of exhortations. Go to the bar at any science and technology studies conference, and it wonât take too many drinks before social scientists start telling you about how their research is often understood as âpublic engagementâ; how they consistently have to justify their expertise to their collaborators; how they have to translate (or sometimes give up on) their conceptual language in a way that is not always reciprocated, and so on. This doesnât mean that life scientists in collaborations are especially power-hungry; or that they behave badly (no doubt most would be surprised and taken aback to learn that their collaborators would narrate their experience in such ways). But it is to say that when a group of people collaborate within institutional structures that end up placing the more highly valued epistemological frameworks, as well as financial resources, largely on one side, then asymmetries result. Even among â and perhaps especially among â the most well-meaning people, such asymmetries can produce some unlovely relations. It is important to note that such relations are rarely, if ever, explicitly endorsed by collaborating life scientists, and life scientists themselves often do not gain from them. Indeed, to the extent that interdisciplinary asymmetries of power can produce silences and absences, there is a significant risk that they reduce the space for the complex collaborative entanglements that motivate many scientific collaborators in the first place. Perhaps more importantly, and this is perhaps not always so visible to collaborators, even if natural scientists in particular collaborations may appear to hold all the power, those scientists themselves are subject to precisely the same asymmetries, when they reenter a larger prestige economy that might mark their collaborations with social scientists or humanities scholars as decidedly low-value contributions. And this is to say nothing of the way that natural scientists may experience a more subtle asymmetry, as they get pinioned by the philosopherâs or literary theoristâs rhetorical monopoly on, and their own explicit exclusion from, what it means to think âcriticallyâ.

At the core of our vision was the desire to bring good products out into the world, create even better cars, and bring smiles to the faces of our customers. Based on this, we boosted our management foundations and create new products. Itâs an old turn of phrase, but one of the Five Main Principles of Toyoda called for contributing to the common good. It means being of use to the world through the medium of the automobile industry. This way of thinking is deeply imbued in our workforce. We donât think we are making cars for profits, but rather we want to be of use to the common good by making cars. Around the time we joined the company, the important thing was developing and deliver cars that were highly reliable and offered good cost performance so that everyone could drive a car, and through that make life more convenient. After that, we worked on building the Prius and making fuel-cell powered vehicles in our effort to be of use to everyone through cars that offer excellent environmental performance. At that point, when we thought about what idea should be our next focal point, the one that we of course felt really struck home was the impact of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report on the need to reduce to zero or even shift into the negative range greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the twenty-first century. However, this simply is not something that can be handled right away. Thatâs why we set as our target year 2050, which is 50 years before the centuryâs end.

Browneâs statutory pardon deliberately excluded the most difficult cases, such as murderers and mutineers. Moreover, he included a caveat that recognised the importance of historic justice, which deliberately did not bring into doubt the standards, procedures and judgments that condemned these men in the first place. In other words, it could be argued that Browneâs blanket pardon cleverly sidesteps the difficult legal ground, focussing more on the moral case that re-evaluates âjust desertsâ in terms of how we understand the stresses of the First World War today. In doing so, Browne emphasised the importance of posthumous pardoning in the lives of the families who continue to suffer because of what happened to their relatives. Again, in Browneâs own words: Although this is a historical matter, I am conscious of how the families of these men feel today. They had to endure the stigma for decades.

Apparently, he wants to lay his cards on the table. Jerry tells Cantor that âheâ cannot accept the Nobel Prize (card game terms: that he has decided to pass), but Cantor retorts that he is not authorised to make such a decision by himself. The prize was awarded for what âweâ published in Nature, not for experimental work conducted by a post-doc and proving somewhat difficult to replicate. Once the card of the Nobel Prize is played, it cannot be repealed or refused. Even Sartre (who refused the Nobel Prize for literature for ideological reasons) is still on the list of Nobel laureates. In response to Staffordâs reluctance, Cantor decides to deal the cards (to divide the roles) as follows: while Stafford will be allowed to speak first, to cover the theory, Cantor will subsequently describe his âsecondâ experiment, so that all scepticism concerning Staffordâs âfirstâ experiment will be trumped. But Stafford is less frank or naÃ¯ve than Cantor suspects, and is actually holding his cards close to his chest. There is a secret hidden in the sealed envelope of his Nobel Prize speech. Initially, everything seems in order. In the main aula of the Karolinska institute, Stafford announces that they will present their work in chronological order, starting with the âtheoretical constructâ (p. 197). The slides of the presentation are like playing cards, and initially, Stafford puts his cards on the table as expected. But then, suddenly, his tone of voice seems to change: âLet us now turn to the relation of theory to factsâ¦ A theory cannot be proven but only disproved. In other words, it must be tested experimentallyâ¦Therefore, I would now like to addressâ¦â (p. 198). Until now, Cantor had been quite relaxed, but now his âmental radar started to detect the first blips of irregularity. Was it the use of the first person singular?â (p. 198; my italics) The âIâ form (the use of the first person singular here) is symptomatic and indicates that Jerry suddenly plays his trump card. Actually, he has two surprises in store for Cantor. The first one is that he presents a detailed account of his first experiment. And the second is that, apparently, but unbeknownst to Cantor, this experiment has now finally been replicated by Dr. Ohashi (the post-doc at Kraussâs lab at Harvard), so that Cantorâs second experiment, as well as his Nobel speech, become quite irrelevant. Initially, there were problems repeating the work, Stafford admits, but when each step was scrutinised carefully, the discrepancy was finally discovered. In addition to the experiment as reported, there are always hidden instructions, apparently trivial details, which may become significant after all, so that âeven the smallest detail should be put into oneâs notebookâ (p. 198). Meanwhile, Stafford continues, â¦we had conceived a second testâ¦ which is now under scrutiny in Professorâs Kraussâs laboratory. I have no reason to doubt that it will also be replicatedâ¦ So we actually have two independent tests in support of our theory. I trust that none of you will consider this just a superfluous crossing of a t, the unnecessary dotting of an i. After all, âtumorigenesis theoryâ has two tâs. And the work itself was performed by two Iâs: myself, and then Professor Isidore Cantor. He will now tell you about that second experiment (p. 199)."
143,512,0.955,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Because the media perceived it as an attempt by the state to control media, we concluded that this was main reason for the media hostility. In addition, the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System, the regional cable we had abandoned, and another private initiative put pressure on us to abandon the initiative. The media accused us of flouting procurement rules. This prompted the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the African Center for Open Governance (Africog), the Efficiency Monitoring Unit, the auditor generalâs office, and a host of other civil society investigative agencies to start probing the project. Adding to the challenges was the post-election violence in Kenya after the disputed presidential elections of 2007. From my 11th-floor office at Teleposta Towers, I watched anti-riot police patrol Nairobiâs streets. The project contractor, Alcatel, wanted legal and financial guarantees in order to start the work. And Parliament, which approves such guarantees, was not in session. I consulted Joseph Kinyua, my counterpart at the Treasury Department and an optimist like me who shared the dream of bringing ICT to Kenya. He suggested that I approach the CCK, the then industry regulator, or Kenyaâs biggest telcom, Safaricom. Both these entities had the financial capability to provide a guarantee. Michael Joseph, Safaricomâs CEO at the time, was sympathetic to my request but said it would require Safaricom board approval. I concluded that selling the idea to the Safaricom board would be a tall order and decided to pursue other means. I approached John Waweru, the directorgeneral of CCK. Here too we needed board approval. I pushed the agenda through, because I was a board member at CCK. That evening, I lobbied the board members one by one, and by the time the board met, I had sufficient support, and they approved the provision of the guarantee. This did not go down well with Patrick Musimba (now the member of Parliament for Kibwezi) who, shortly thereafter, resigned from his board position. Permanent Secretary Kinyua then gave confirmation to CCKâs bankers about the deal, Citibank, which needed confirmation from the Treasury before it could give the guarantee. We secured the guarantee a few days before the March 2008 signing of the National Peace Accord, which brought peace to Kenya, and within days Alcatel moved ships to the United Arab Emirates to begin laying cable."

Two of the goals also provide targets for governance improvements and the quality of institutions and partnerships, which should help the implementation process (UN 2015). Some critics may lament that these goals are pipe dreams, too ambitious and sometimes contradictory, given that the socioeconomic pledges can only be realized if the targets for environmental protection are missed. I think that this will certainly be the case if the spirit of transformation and radical change that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed in his 2014 preparatory report on reaching the SDGs is lost. Ki-moon wrote, âTransformation is our watchword. At this moment in time, we are called to lead and act with courage. We are called to embrace change. Change in our societies. Change in the management of our economies. Change in our relationship with our one and only planetâ (UN 2014: 3). It is this spirit of transformation that I want to support with this book. To me it holds a renewed window of opportunity for the radical changes that in essence the sustainable development agenda always held. And I want to show that radicalness in purpose should not be conflated with a call for instant revolution, tearing down the system or hostility to dissenting ideas. Radicalness in purpose is equivalent to holding a vision or belief in what could be possible if X, Y or Z was to change, an imaginary that stirs up energy, commitmentâand persistence in taking the many incremental steps required to get there. Sociologists use the term âimaginaryâ to capture more than ideas: it includes a set of values, institutions, laws and symbols with which people imagine their social whole. Without this combination of radical imaginary and persistent progress toward it, not much transformation will happen, at least not in the direction of sustainable development. The path dependencies that shape humanityâs activities and development dynamics today are pushing and pulling in a decidedly non-sustainable direction. This is why I also want to make the case that we should not simply stick the label âtransformationâ on any amendment to the status quo, or call each technological efï¬ciency gain an âinnovation.â If the benchmark for the changes to which we aspire is not radically different to the one that has guided development solutions so far, humanity will not escape those strong path dependencies. At the same time, dismissing the role that incremental steps play in getting there means ignoring the insights that complex system research offers about patterns of change. So juxtaposing the two approaches as entirely separate strategiesâa practice often used to discredit someone elseâs proposalsâdoes not help. What helps is to keep each other challenged with respect to both the radicalness of the imagined outcomes (what do we deem possible) and the amount of change in this direction that the next, often little, steps could bring (what do we do to make it happen). This book speaks to this combination under the tagline of radical incremental transformation strategies. The purpose that these strategies should serve here is long-term sustainable development as deï¬ned in the Rio Declaration of 1992 and"

We take it as given that, as Gentile puts it â(w)hen doing fieldwork in countries ruled by authoritarian regimes it is possible that phone calls, emails and letters are monitoredâ, and further assume that any online activity, or documents on online servers or in virtual clouds, may be subject to scrutiny. Our most elaborate fieldwork preparations as a group related to data security, in particular contact details of respondents and interview transcripts. Before our fieldwork, our project had organized a few digital security training sessions from an expert in this area. With hindsight though, we have come to second-guess some of our initial learnings from these sessions, which were very much inspired by a post-Snowden focus on digital surveillance and online intrusions at the expense of thinking through more traditional security threats and basic travel precautions. One common device we had agreed on was to take two laptops into the field: one for web browsing, e-mails, and so on and one secondhand laptop that never went online, but acted almost as a typewriter, for transcribing interviews. We would keep these separate from the actual contact details of these respondents. We have found, however, that applying high levels of digital security also has disadvantages. Now, we tend to think data security more in terms of trade-offs. The first is that it is simply time-consuming and cumbersome. In Kazakhstan, our researcher initially used two computers and two phones, with three SIM cards. Both the China and the Malaysia researchers took no less than three laptops into the field, a heavy load. Transcribing interviews on an offline laptop protects respondents from electronic surveillance and would make their identity hard to detect, but of course it does not offer absolute security. It also increases the chances of losing transcripts. Indeed, our researcher in Gujarat,"

As it has already been mentioned previously, central banks are charged with a gatekeeper-from-inï¬ation role, and for them keeping inï¬ation as low as possible is the top priority â not taking in consideration the economic growth forgone due to such policies. Let me take the argument against overly rigid inï¬ation control one step further. I believe that moderate inï¬ation can be a good thing â not any kind of inï¬ation, and not in all situations of course. In the twentieth century, inï¬ation has wrecked many economies and inï¬icted incredible hardship on many people. But I have also seen inï¬ation act as an investment accelerator, and I think governments should take advantage of this phenomenon. While high inï¬ation is bad, deï¬ationary pressure can also have detrimental effects on the economy â less dramatic perhaps, but potentially more prolonged. And if demand-driven economic slowdown and deï¬ationary pressure coincide, even strong economies can suffer and ï¬nd themselves facing a recession. Examples include Japan, for the past three decades, and the European Union, for almost past decade. Look at it this way. Assume you want to buy a house. Prices go down, so you decide to wait a while. You want to get a good deal, and what is the harm in holding out for a few weeks? An investor considering to buy another company will behave in much the same way, hoping that the valuation of the target will decrease. Or put yourself in the shoes of a manufacturing company.

That was why she managed to get the job in the first place and also managed to keep it. She recalled that a substitute teacher with darker skin, curly hair revealing her African ancestry and clothing that revealed her less affluent background had been bullied so much by her pupils that she had resigned after a week."

You need to be extremely well organized to do this sort of analysis without making any mistakes. A high degree of serenity is required throughout. What makes it difï¬cult is keeping track of the interactions that are in the model and those that have been excluded, and making absolutely sure that no nuisance variables have been omitted unintentionally. It turns out that life can be made much more straightforward if the analysis can be reformulated as an exercise in proportions rather than counts, because if it can, then all of the problems with nuisance variables disappear. On p. 643 the example is reanalysed with the response variable as a proportion in a GLM with binomial errors. This is possible because we have just two species, so we can reformulate the response as the proportion of all lizards that are A. opalinus. This is a big advantage because it does away with the need to retain any of the nuisance variables."

Even though still considered by many as farfetched science fiction, in some ways it has already begun. In the not-too-distant future, digital agents may represent us to some extent, behaving and acting like us. With the added functionality of learning from their mistakes, they will have a life of their own. Thus, a rudimentary self will continue to live in cyberspace even after our death. Once we have reached the point when an entirely, conscious self can be transferred, we will have managed to transfer the human mind to a machine. At that point, we will face new questions, such as, what happens if the biological equivalent continues to live?"

390,61,0.955,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"Interestingly, no current flows through the common part of the circuit when both lightbulbs are lit. By using a common to join two separate circuits into one circuit, weâve reduced the electrical connection between the two houses from four wires to three wires and reduced our wire expenses by 25 percent. If we had to string the wires for a very long distance, we might be tempted to reduce our wiring expenses even more by eliminating another wire. Unfortunately, this isnât feasible with 1.5-volt D cells and small lightbulbs. But if we were dealing with 100-volt batteries and much larger lightbulbs, it could certainly be done. Hereâs the trick: Once you have established a common part of the circuit, you donât have to use wire for it. You can replace the wire with something else. And what you can replace it with is a giant sphere approximately 7900 miles in diameter made up of metal, rock, water, and organic material, most of which is dead. This giant sphere is known to us as Earth. When I described good conductors in the previous chapter, I mentioned silver, copper, and gold, but not gravel and mulch. In truth, the earth isnât such a great conductor, although some kinds of earth (damp soil, for example) are better than others (such as dry sand). But one thing we learned about conductors is this: the larger the better. A very thick wire conducts much better than a very thin wire. Thatâs where the earth excels. Itâs really, really, really big. To use the earth as a conductor, you canât merely stick a little wire into the ground next to the tomato plants. You have to use something that maintains a substantial contact with the earth, and by that I mean a conductor with a large surface area. One good solution is a copper pole at least 8 feet long and Â½ inch in diameter. That provides 150 square inches of contact with the earth. You can bury the pole into the ground with a sledgehammer and then connect a wire to it. Or, if the cold-water pipes in your home are made of copper and originate in the ground outside the house, you can connect a wire to the pipe. An electrical contact with the earth is called an earth in England and a ground in America. A bit of confusion surrounds the word ground because itâs also often used to refer to a part of a circuit weâve been calling the common. In this chapter, and until I indicate otherwise, a ground is a physical connection with the earth. When people draw electrical circuits, they use this symbol to represent a ground:"

Ted sees the value of whatâs in between, over and underneathâhow things connect. This is how he dreamt up hypertext, which goes so far beyond the typeset page (Fig. 12.2). WHATâS LOST: The nuance expressed in the shape of a line, the words deleted in edits. Sentences crossed out. Text inserted. Ink blots from late nights working, historical coffee stains. The list goes on! WHATâS TO BE GAINED: The employment of the power of massively fast, massively connected computers. Iâd like to use the game Battlefield 4 as an example. Itâs a game thatâs available on Playstation and PC (available by search on YouTube). This is live game play, this is what the kids (cough, me) play these days.

275,280,0.955,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"9.4 How do We Know Who or What Is Trustworthy How do we decide whether to trust? In Sect. 9.3 the properties that establish and define trustworthiness were considered. In this section the epistemology of trustworthiness is examined-how do we know who or what is trustworthy? What are the indicators of trust? If a person claims to justifiably trust another, it indicates they have the ability and confidence to predict othersâ behaviour [62]. Implicit, heuristic or âgutâ indicators of trust are often grounded in physical responses and intuitions. Explicit, reflective or rational trust stems from our experience of people over time and our reasons to judge their trustworthiness. Often we do not know why we trust, we trust implicitly. Thomas Reid (1764) [75] argued that reasons could not be required for trust given thatâmost men would be unable to find reasons for believing the thousandth part of what is told them.â Reidâs point is that humans must be justified to trust even in the absence of reasons. Consider the way we use Google maps. Many people use Google maps to get them where they need to go, without knowing how Google maps works, how their phone works or how traffic influences the instructions Google maps provides. Not only do people not know why they trust Google maps, it does not seem to concern people that they do not know why. So how do humans make trust judgments of systems and each other, and are these the same mechanisms that elicit trust in AS? This section moves through implicit and explicit justifications of trust followed by a cognitive model of trust and competence and finally a brief comment on the relationship between trustworthiness and risk."

[My University] now has [an] initiative that studies tech and society, for example. You need a human perspective around scientific innovations and their applications. As4: Natural sciences create technologies and social sciences propose various policies, but it is only humanities who can tell us how they can be used wisely. As16: Philosophy helps us foresee the impact of new technologies (or gives us the tools to do so). Challenging social norms Humanities research can often be the source of challenges to widely accepted social values and traditions. In this way it may actually be in tension with social cohesion. This role overlaps with critical thinking, being a specific instance of it, so we shall have more to say below. But for the moment, here is one of our interviewees testifying to the critical value of the humanities in a social context: As2: I would just say that it is only in the humanities and social sciences that we still produce a âcritical discourseâ. Science, technology and even economics have stopped performing that function. The curricula in these areas have no element of criticism per se, making it difficult for them to contribute to the formation of critical citizenship. It has proved more than once in the course of the last century that pure science and economics have failed to produce an understanding of the symbolic life that makes us social and therefore human. This point was also stressed at our Latin American workshop. Institution building Finally, it is worth recording three interview responses (from India, Lebanon and Russia) that linked the humanities to the creation and nurturing of strong institutions: ME3: The humanities are essential for building strong institutions.

He found it puzzling and disturbing that many poor people seemed to prioritize buying consumer goods, at any cost, and that children were being pushed into a consumer culture through all media channels, supported by parents who failed to gain consciousness themselves. Indeed, a major concern of many activists was, above all, for young people, who were continuously induced into believing that âanything foreignâ was way better than anything Venezuelan. All the brands that children and youthsâ culture revolved around were foreign: McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, Disney, Hello Kitty, Monster High, Hollywood blockbusters, Blackberry, Apple, Nike, Ralph Lauren, the list is endless. The subject was also brought up in a conversation with Marta, a woman in her 30s originally of humble origins but now an accomplished singer. Over a cup of coffee by her motherâs dining table in one of the low-rise apartment blocks in 23 de Enero, she spelled it out like this: What is the most problematic about it? Ideologically we are still, we could say that the revolution is still in between the Fourth and the Fifth Republic â¦ the masses, el pueblo has really not imprinted, formed, what is socialism, this is why we are still living in the midst of capitalism.

Chavismo has this element which is what the esqualidos donât have, it doesnât interest them â¦ but what happens? I am talking about the ideological element, the fight against consumerism, because certainly we have been able to break through these things and created a sense of patria, of national identification, of pride of being Venezuelan, of recognition, about what it means to be Bolivarian, where are we coming from, where are our roots, but still there are elements that are"

If there are perceptions of paying too much, there will also be expectations of getting as much back. On the other hand, getting very little from the state also means that the willingness to contribute is even less. It could be put as a question about the chicken and egg, but in terms of a reciprocal relation it is rather about how the Maori proverb was originally translated: âGive as much as you take, all shall be very wellâ (Mauss 2002 [1990]: 91). Mauss pointed out in a footnote that the wording is rather âas much as Maru gives, so much Maru takes and this is good, goodâ (ibid.: 189). Larry further illuminates contributive versus distributive reciprocity. âThey cheat me everywhere, so I take a little bit in return. I minimise the damage.

The dominant approach to improving care [in low-income countries] (as a result) involves continuing professional development but (as Byrne-Davis et al. point out), âlittle is known about their impact on practiceâ (2016: 59). One might argue that the best way to deal with this situation is not to deploy British professionals as volunteers but to improve local human resource management systems to require senior staff to be present and take on training roles, and for the health system itself to develop CME systems rather than relying on foreign interventions. In the capacity-building work we are currently engaged in, in the area of bio-medical engineering aimed at increasing the skills levels of practising technicians, we are beginning to lobby for the development of a CME system and to support the development of its constituent modules. At present, no such thing is in place.2 However, for the time being, this is the context within which professional volunteers will engage on a day-to-day basis. One might argue that training in itself is innocuous and can only add value. And, the more people we train presumably the more potential there is for positive systems change. One of the SVP volunteers expressed this view in an interview and in response to a question about the role that volunteers could play in system change: I donât even know how [a volunteer] would go about [engaging with systems]. There are so many levels of mistrust and corruption. Where to even start to inï¬ltrate the system and go about it in the right way especially if youâre a foreigner trying to come in and introduce policy. Itâs not even a can of worms. Itâs like a reservoir of snakes.

It was clear that there were many stories of discrimination, prejudice and stigma, but also messages that suffering could be overcome. Much of the language used reflected the international and even global outlook of organisations such as these, particularly in their use of terms such as âcrisisâ and ârecoveryâ, and in statements about patient rights. One of the videos showed Daniel, a teacher who for a long time did not want to be open about his mental health problems for fear of what his students might think. He explained, âWhen I was young I used to see mulalu (a mad person) and I was like, what did they do? You know perhaps people have say here donât mind him he robbed someone so they bewitched him. I know that mystery, but the end of the day heâs a human being, whose mind is a bit disoriented, and he needs to be taken care ofâ. Another video showed Elizabeth, who had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, and had suffered from depression for a few years. In her words, âIt was at Heartsounds that I first found comments of, âwow, youâre brilliantâ, âwow, you can do thisâ. Those comments first came from Heartsoundsâ. Elizabeth continued to explain how with family you could do good things and you could do bad, but âthey are always ready to criticise the badâ¦And you can live life knowing you can never do anything goodâ.17 For the first few years, the peer support work pioneered by Heartsounds was relatively informal, but in 2012, the Butabika-East London Link was successful in securing funding from DfiD and the Tropical Health and Education Trust to run âBrain Gainâ. This project formalised and expanded peer support work by training approximately thirty-six peer support workers over a two-year period. Peer supporters then went out into communities in Kampala and met with people who had recently been released from Butabika.18 While the project reportedly had success in convincing psychiatrists at Butabika, who had initially been resistant, of the benefits of the approach, overall the project faced financial mismanagement and fraud, with some of the money from the international partnership being diverted into other projects. Some of those involved also point to power struggles within Heartsounds, with some feeling that Atukunda was not mentally stable enough to run the organisation, and that women who had childcare commitments were being pushed out of peer support work. When the Butabika-East London Link was successful in securing funding for âBrain Gain 2â in 2015, the project was moved into Butabika itself.

299,415,0.955,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"In many discussions of the ethical challenges posed by driverless cars, and smart machines generally, they are referred to as âautonomous.â To begin with, one must recall that not every scholar is willing to take it for granted that even human beings act autonomously. Some hold that everything that happens is caused by sufficient antecedent conditions which make it impossible for said thing to happen differently (or to not happen); such causal determinism renders it impossible to assign moral responsibility (see for example van Inwagen 2003; Harris 2011). There is no need here to repeat the arguments against this position, and it suffices to note that we file with those who take it for granted that human beings have some measure of free will, though much of their lives may indeed be determined by forces beyond their understanding and control (Frankfurt 1969). However, it does not follow that the same holds for machines, however smart they are. Indeed, a colleague who read a previous draft of this chapter argued that it only seems like smart machines make decisions on their ownâin actuality, changes in how these machines conduct themselves merely reflect external forces. One could say, he pointed out, that a missile diverted from its original course by a strong gush of wind âdecidedâ to change direction, but this would be merely a misperception, an illusion. As we see it, autonomy is a variable that exists along a continuum. Some tools have no autonomy; one can fully account for their behavior by forces external to them. A hammer hitting a nail has no autonomy even when it misses because one can show that the miss was due to the inexperience of the person using it, poor eyesight, or some other such external factor. A rudimentary GPS system may be said to have a very small measure of autonomy, because when asked the best way to get from point a to point b, it compares several options and recommends one, but its"
48,35,0.955,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"3.2 Communication of Time Predictions Assume that the car service tells you that the repair will be finished in four and a half hours. What does this information mean? Is the prediction meant to be a best-case prediction, assuming that the work is done by the most skilled service professional and with no unexpected problems? Is it a promise based on a worst-case time prediction? And if it is a worst-case prediction, how sure can you be that the car is actually finished in four and a half hours? If you really need your car back in four and a half hours, the meaning of the time prediction will matter a lot. Whether the prediction was based on a best-case scenario or on experience documenting that 99% of car repairs in similar situations required less than four and a half hours will make an important difference. If the estimate was a best-case prediction, you should have a backup plan, while a 99% likelihood prediction based on past repairs should make you sufficiently safe that the car will be at your disposal when you need it. Most people do not, as far as we have observed in various domains, explain what they mean by their time predictions. We cannot even assume that people in the same context and with similar backgrounds mean the same thing with their time predictions. We once asked software developers to give their time predictions for completion a programming task [4]. Immediately afterward, we asked them how we should interpret their time predictions. When summarizing their responses, we used the category ideal effort if a time prediction was based on the assumption of no unexpected problems, most likely effort if a time prediction was what they thought was the most likely outcome, median effort if a time prediction was what they thought was about 50% likely not to be exceeded, and risk-averse effort if a time prediction was considered very likely to be sufficient to complete the work."

Since the evaluation process is not seen as legitimate, people display strategic behaviour towards the evaluations. This problem is often referred to in the literature as âgamingâ the system (cf. Hood 2006). This seems to range from trying to avoid consequences from evaluations (especially with regard to the ranking exercise) to outright plagiarism in order to meet research requirements (or indeed improve oneâs status). The irony is that the evaluations may reinforce the very gaming behaviour they are meant to address. The following quote from a faculty member is instructive: [In order to fulï¬l the publication criteria,] âI take information from studentsâ diploma projects.

Mikul: Our main goal with EatOut at the moment is to ensure that we have Number-One market share within the industry, and we have therefore explored many different opportunities. Our magazine Yummy and activities such as Nairobi Restaurant Week have done well to generate revenue and increase our presence as an industry authority. We recently decided to explore the e-gift voucher market, allowing consumers to purchase and redeem digital gift vouchers securely online, tapping into a multi-billion-shilling industry (the shilling is the Kenyan currency) and providing easy gift solutions for the diaspora. In 2016, our aim is to have pop-up stores in high-traffic locations such as supermarkets and malls. On the other hand, we decided not to continue with an online restaurant delivery pilot due to the fact that there were already a number of start-ups concentrating on the same thing. We also felt that the market was simply not large enough to justify a heavy investment in building the logistics infrastructure and customer service team required to service it. Ritesh: We have tested a number of opportunities, from alcohol delivery and a mobile juice bar concept to providing third-party logistics to other consumer brands. The reasons why most of those concepts were not feasible as standalone businesses were mainly centered around two themes. Number one was the size of market. As interesting as some of these businesses may have seemed on the surface, some of them just did not have a large enough customer base for the business to be sustainable. Let me"

I waited on the ground, to see which branches he chose to step on, in preparation for my own foray towards the top. Suddenly he lost his grip and fell. When he came to a stop, he let out a high pitch scream. As I drew closer, I could see that the tip of a branch was inside his mouth. He had been pierced right through the cheek by a dry branch sticking out from the trunk. In great pain, he managed to maneuver himself away from the tree, with blood running from the wound in his face. Most of the narratives in this book are from organizational life and collected through interviews, but this one is personal. During my childhood in a suburb of Norwayâ capital Oslo in the 1960s and early 70s, it was normal for children to roam our neighborhoods and explore the world from different heights and perspectives. We sought adventure and excitement, and the adults tended to ignore our potentially harmful encounters with trees and branches. I can still vividly remember my friendâs scream and the sight of the tip of the branch inside his mouth. That dramatic incident put both him and me in a state of temporary shock, but a few days later, we were making further daring ventures towards the treetops.

How exactly we need to respond will be different for each person and each situation. For some, professional counseling is in order, for others, spiritual (self-)help is the best answer. At a minimum, we should talk to friends and colleagues about what has happened and its impact on us. Others too have found that âmaintaining meaningful contact with others (friends, family, professional networks) is one of the best ways to mitigate the potential impacts of traumaâ (Loyle and Simoni 2017, referencing Dickson-Swift et al. 2008). We would argue that this is all the more important in authoritarian contexts, which are already liable to propel us in the direction of paranoia and mental isolation. This is borne out, for instance, by the experience of Begley, who investigated what was behind the apparent popular support for the RPF in Rwanda, and not only encountered constant surveillance but also had to worry, more than we have had to do, about the risk her interviews posed to respondents. She writes how â(t)hese fears added to the increasing feelings of frustration, constant mistrust, feelings of always being watched, and having no one who understood the situation to offer advice or support, essentially imprisoned me, leaving no secure way to communicate anything to anyoneâ (Begley 2013, 82; see also Malekzadeh 2016, 868). It appears to have been this sense of isolation as much as the fear itself that caused her to suffer from post-traumatic stress after fieldwork. Apart from recognizing stress symptoms, and finding our own personal ways of addressing them, we should also consider how stressful incidents, hard stories or traumatic events affect our written work. We should reflect on the possible validity gain, but also the risk of bias or self-censorship, once we ourselves or people we know personally have suffered from forms of repression. The quality of our conversations with colleagues who rely on desk-based work stands to gain from such self-reflection. And we should reconsider, after stressful incidents, hard stories or traumatic events on what fields we are prepared to revisit; what topics we are, and are not, willing to explore; and what methods we want to employ, in future research. Then there is physical impact. While our team had extensively prepared for the specificities of authoritarian fieldwork, and given some attention to potential mental impact, we had neglected to consider the combined physical impact of pollution, temperature changes, change of diet, and hard work. If we experience stressful incidents, hard stories or traumatic events as described above, our bodies take yet another hit from the"

As a project, we successfully applied for a signiï¬cant number of Commonwealth Professional Fellowships which enabled us to bring Ugandan colleagues working in these facilities over to the UK for periods of between one and six months. This has played a very valuable role in augmenting relationships11 and exposing them to the environment in UK universities and hospitals. The Fellows continue to play a very valuable role in supporting student information days, awareness raising and induction processes. In the evaluation, no students reported any concerns about the level of supervision they received from local staff since many received sufï¬cient supervision from a PV. Students believed they could access supervision quickly should it be required as the following excerpt suggests: Obviously being a student and being unsupervised isnât ideal however if I ever had any questions or needed support I could always call [the PV] and she would inform me about what to do or come over if it was an emergency.

The couple Cindy and Derek are shown to be unable to communicate after their son has died, instead, Cindy logs into the support site New hope â Donât grieve alone, while Derek delves into online gambling. As the plot evolves, the intimacy and focus in the online scenes stand in stark contrast to the portrayal of âreal-lifeâ interactions; these are distant, cold and sometimes aggressive and violent. The ï¬lm reï¬ects the criticism that social and online media draw individuals away from their nearest and dearest, undermining personal bonds and family rituals (Ch. 5). In one of several similar scenes, we are shown how the teenager Benâs mother desperately try to retain real-life conversations at the dinner table; she says to Ben âCan you please not do that at the tableâ to stop his constant texting, but Ben points out that his father is texting too and the dinner disintegrates; the father says âI have to take this,â picks up the phone and talks to a client. The character of Benâs father Rich is almost too familiar; he is a successful lawyer constantly ï¬ddling with his cell phone, clearly not having a clue about what is going on in his disconnected family. It is only when his son Ben hangs himself as a result of online abuse that his father understands what is really important. The characterâs constant chatting signal loneliness and a desperate desire to connect, but also vulnerability and risk, since there is so much deception. Disconnect portrays a society where you cannot really trust anyone you meet online; the couple Cindy and Derek are severely punished for their online life as one day they ï¬nd their bank accounts empty and it turns out that someone online has stolen their identities. As their belongings are repossessed because they can no longer pay their bills, suspicion falls on the mourner that Cindy has been chatting with and trusting with their secrets, although he turns out to be innocent, the message is that deceit, surveillance and cybercrime lurks around every corner. In the third story, it is the runaway Kyle who is deceived by the journalist Nina; while Kyle is trusting and believes that she will help him to a better life, she is really only out to get a story and betrays him by giving up his address to FBI. Clearly, you cannot even trust mainstream media or lawmakers to help you if trouble strikes. Like Videodrome and Truman, Disconnect portrays media corporations to be powerful and outside the realm of policy and law-enforcement. However, in contrast to the ï¬lms about television (above), those who own and control digital networks are depicted as faceless and distant.

By this time, one of the giant corporations had gotten wind of the fact that we were subjecting the matter to the procurement law and offered to pay the valuation price. Posta immediately tried to scuttle this new development by failing to effect board decisions. The Commission wrote again, insisting that the land should be sold to the highest bidder. The risk from our perspective was that the highest bidder might turn out not to be the companies that caused us to embark on the project in the first place. I briefed Ambassador Muthaura, who issued a directive that the land be sold at the valuation price. The Commission ignored the directive and wrote to me saying it would hold me personally responsible. To complicate matters, the management of Posta refused to sign off on the land. We contemplated a disciplinary action against management. However, if such a recourse got into the media, it would be costly to the corporate image of the two global giants that just wanted to create job opportunities through ICT development. Later, I discovered that some employees in Posta were enjoying a monthly income from leasing the land in question to informal motor vehicle dealers. Out of self-interest, they may had looped in some junior Commission officials in destroying a deal with a huge potential to create much-needed jobs in Kenya and thwarted an important step toward advancing ICT innovation. The Posta case is significant in policymaking, because it illustrates how policy of any kind cannot work where personal interests obscure decision-making. It also shows that, although the upper echelons of government might formulate a policy, middle-level managers can ultimately sabotage the policy out of personal interest. Both the general systems and interactive decision-making theories work on the assumption that there is transparency among all players. The reality is that often there is none."

People drew on both of the two interpretive frames described above: students expressed simultaneously a professional concern about offending their hostsâ sensibilities and an individual anxiety about personal spiritual harm. For these second year students, the death brought back bad memories of their own first year trip to Barowagi in neighboring Simbu Province. Though no one from the college had been near the vehicle at the time, they had been blamed when a local manâs car was destroyed, their tutor accused of causing the crash with her âhard words.â Ellen told me the story of the car crash during an interview. Their tutor, who had retired by the time of my fieldwork, had lost her temper with the pastor in Barowagi who was hosting them. One day she âpressurizedâ (presaraisim) the pastor. We went there in the dry season. The little creek we bathed in was dry, and we had to go to the big river [far away]. No water to cook either. This [tutor] went and yelled at the pastor and said, âYou people, you donât recognize when a good thing comes inside your community. If you take visitors in, you must provide for all their needs.

The jungle meat meals I observed were therefore events in which law makers (politicians) and law officers (policemen) ritually and publically broke the law they were charged with upholding and enforcing. Since in many cases those paying for the meal were potential partners for illicit or corrupt deals, my understanding is that the meal, alcohol, and sex paid by the hosts were not only a direct form of bribe but also a conduit to future relations: the co-diners were breaking a relatively unimportant law together, creating bonding, trust, and mutual dependency that would stabilize ongoing cooperation. While I never shared a meal with corrupt officials, my interlocutors described these culinary events several times, shifting from condemning attitude toward the official corruption, to the description of their own pleasure during these meals and accompanying activities. They made it clear that they felt blackmailed by the officials, who made them pay for the expensive food and services in return for things such as licenses and permits, which they were entitled too in any case, or for things that were clearly illegal, such as the postponing of military draft. In most cases I was told that they did not like the company of the officials themselves who were greedy and took advantage of their position. But when I asked about the food, they often commented that it was very delicious. In some cases, they also mentioned that the food had an impact on their libido and their sexual relations with the beer-girls. The comments about the good food and sexual relations were often followed by inviting me to join such a meal. I was first confused by this shift: how was it possible that they felt blackmailed and yet enjoyed the food, drink, and sexual services so much? And why would they want to repeat this experience with me? I gradually realized however, that this combination of shame, guilt, and pleasure was very attractive, and that one way of dealing with the negative aspects of shame and guilt was by arguing that everyone (i.e., all men) take part in such practices. I was invited to join in to not only share the pleasure with me but also the shame and guiltâshare the burden as it were and relieve my friends of some of it.

Exploring in this way is a challenge to do within the framework of their existing curriculum. At least, it is a challenge to do in a satisfactory way. More time and depth are needed to get past the flattening of social science to a set of recognizable tools or a body of largely pre-intuitable societal knowledge. We will need more, and longer-term, engagements if we want to get across its power as a set of alternative methodological strategies for getting a grip on the world. The starting point for the PAGES collaboration was this realization: interdisciplinary collaboration is hard. That proved true all along the way. When it succeeded in PAGES, the outcome had much to do with trust, voice, and personal relationships. The only adequate way to close is with admiration for those colleagues and NE students and postdocs who made it possible for social scientists to engage with nuclear engineers."

Some of them we have a hand in ourselves, and with the right knowledge, we can positively influence our wellness and the quality of life for ourselves and our environment. This does not just produce better physical health, but also a much greater degree of pleasure in life, higher general productivity and an improved sense of well-being. The POP research has tried to make this visible for you. In general, we can state that human health is determined by what we eat, breathe, drink and how we move physically with the right motivation. Awareness of these factors also alerts us to the elements that can be act as disturbances. We tend to be more aware of the origins and quality of our food. We tend to stop smoking and ventilate our houses better. We more often travel by bike or public transportation, leaving the car at home or even selling it altogether. Things that used to determine the coziness of our homes, like an open ï¬re, candles or aromatic sticks, are replaced by other healthier, more positive alternatives. We also notice that we are talking with each other more and more often about subjects like air quality and health. There are also things we cannot influence because they belong to our DNA-related system, or they are engrained in the reigning culture or structure of society, or they are endemic to the climate in which we live. That is why AiREAS also involves the government, science and innovative entrepreneurship in our common mission. The POP investigation is therefore valuable for influencing every aspect of society and stimulating innovation in which we can all be involved. With our research, we try to give reassurance to everyone that this can all have a positive effect on our health and well-being, as well as a positive outcome for the global issues we face, just by giving the example and showing the results. Hopefully, you have received sufï¬cient tips and insights to enable you to make up your own mind and take action accordingly. If you need help, you can always rely on the support of the entire AiREAS team of partners, including all specialized professionals.

294,74,0.954,Programming For Computations - Python : a Gentle introduction To Numerical Simulations With Python (Volume 15.0),"you try to run the program to see what Pythonâs response is. Then you know what the problem is and understand what the error message is about. This will greatly help you when you get a similar error message or warning later. Very often, you will experience that there are errors in the program you have written. This is normal, but frustrating in the beginning. You then have to find the problem, try to fix it, and then run the program again. Typically, you fix one error just to experience that another error is waiting around the corner. However, after some time you start to avoid the most common beginnerâs errors, and things run more smoothly. The process of finding and fixing errors, called debugging, is very important to learn. There are different ways of doing it too. A special program (debugger) may be used to help you check (and do) different things in the program you need to fix. A simpler procedure, that often brings you a long way, is to print information to the screen from different places in the program. First of all, this is something you should do (several times) during program development anyway, so that things get checked as you go along. However, if the final program still ends up with error messages, you may save a copy of it, and do some testing on the copy. Useful testing may then be to remove, e.g., the latter half of the program (by inserting comment signs #), and insert print commands at clever places to see what is the case. When the first half looks ok, insert parts of what was removed and repeat the process with the new code. Using simple numbers and doing this in parallel with hand calculations on a piece of paper (for comparison) is often a very good idea. Python also offers means to detect and handle errors by the program itself! The programmer must then foresee (when writing the code) that there is a potential for error at some particular point. If, for example, some user of the program is asked (by the running program) to provide a number, and intends to give the number 5, but instead writes the word five, the program could run into trouble. A try-exception construction may be used by the programmer to check for such errors and act appropriately (see Chapter 6.2 for an example), avoiding a program crash. This procedure of trying an action and then recovering from trouble, if necessary, is referred to as exception handling and is the modern way of dealing with errors in a program. When a program finally runs without error messages, it might be tempting to think that Ah. . . , I am finished!. But no! Then comes program testing, you need to verify that the program does the computations as planned. This is almost an art and may take more time than to develop the program, but the program is useless unless you have much evidence showing that the computations are correct. Also, having a set of (automatic) tests saves huge amounts of time when you further develop the program. Verification versus validation"

Therefore, we are interested in the views that citizensâtaxpayersâhave of the authorities, and the views that authorities have of taxpayers. Ultimately, the latter has to be persuaded to comply with taxation; thus they make the state possible (if the state does not have other income). âA strong inner feeling of being morally obliged to return the gift is the quintessence of real-life reciprocityâ (Komter 2014: 162).

143,93,0.954,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"make sense for your company, well, that is on you. Do not blame an industry because you made a bad decision. Angel investors are crucial in funding the ideational phase of a business. What is the current state in Kenya? For angels investors, those who have significant-enough disposable income to risk on investing, in Kenya it is a lot easier to put money into something like property and real estate. That is because we are seeing yearon-year growth of that. It is just astronomical! So it tends to be a smart decision to put your money into those things. What we are starting to see, however, are people in business who have made enough money that they are willing to diversify their portfolio out of just real estate. Where it has changed over the past two to three years is that we are seeing a few more people willing to dabble in tech investments locally. It is not large moneyâmaybe USD25,000 here, USD100,000 thereâbut it is enough to get some companies off the ground. This will continue once angel investors start seeing a little bit of success, and this will bring in more of their peers. Local angel investors can bring to the table more than what outside investors can offer. Outside investors largely bring in money and experience for early-stage company growth, strategy, and management. That is all good. But what they do not bring is connections to other businesses here in Kenya. Connections can immediately increase the share value of the business that the angels have invested in, and so, making the right introductions to CEOs or other companies is powerful. The problem currently is that angel money in Kenya is usually too expensive compared to money from abroad. If you have an investor coming in from the USA, they will give you USD50,000 and take 15 % of your early-stage, prerevenue company. The Kenyan angel will give you USD50,000 and want 50 % of your company, if not more. We need to find a balance where we decrease the cost of equity-based money from local angel investors and increase the knowledge base and connectivity of the money for outside investors. It should not just be money invested in a company. What actually needs to happen is that you are investing mentally and physically in the start-up in order to help it grow their company."

Kinshasa, 19 August 2014. I visited Fabrice, a young man of 22, at one of Kinshasaâs largest markets, the Freedom Market (MarchÃ© de la LibertÃ©). For more than 6 months, Fabrice had been employed in selling smartphones (Lingala tshombo) and accessories. That day, as was generally the case, clients constantly interrupted our conversation. The following encounter stood out in my fieldnotes: A mother and a teenage girl arrived at the counter. In a very selfassured manner, the mother shouts âNani azoteka (who sells here)?â Fabrice asks my permission to suspend our conversation and turns towards the prospective clients. The young girl was promised a smartphone because she succeeded in the state exam (exÃ©tat). To my surprise, I hear Fabrice advising against purchasing a smartphone. He embarks on the âdangersâ (ya mabe, âbad thingsâ) that girls are exposed to âwhen surfing on the net, chatting with strangers, and seeing images that do not suit their ageâ. During Fabriceâs anti-sales pitch, I notice that the young girl is growing increasingly nervous. After some time, and having apparently become really annoyed, she interrupts Fabrice and tells her mother not to listen to him. âWe can buy the smartphone somewhere else,â she states. Fabrice, who fears losing a client, quickly changes his game and showcases a few smartphones on sale. After Fabrice finally sells a second-hand smartphone to the mother, he returns to me. When I confront him about his strange marketing strategies, Fabrice mentions his religious identity. In his church, Shekinah Tabernacle, youth are only allowed to use smartphones from 22 years of age. I had known Fabrice for over a few months by then, and I was visiting him because I knew he was âborn and grew up in the Messageâ (akoli na Message). The idiom, âto have grown up in the Message,â suggests that Fabriceâs parents were already followers of Branham before he was born.6 Along with many Branhamist Christians, Fabrice claims that radios, television sets, and telephones can set kindoki in motion if improperly used. âChildren have little idea of the occult possibilities of mobile phones and the Internet,â he argues, and therefore prohibiting the usage of these tools is a measure of protection against the potentially devilish outcomes of the medium. Accompanied by a friend from his church, Fabrice visited me in my house that same evening, and our conversation came to be dominated"
8,295,0.954,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","with these tricks we can only go so far, because in order to express how small an elementary particle is and how large the currently observable part of the Universe is, we must use numbers that are again beyond our direct comprehension. There are as many protons in a centimeter as there are for example centimeters in the diameter of Earthâs solar orbit, and as another example consider the many Earth orbitâs diameters needed to reach from here to the furthest visible spiral nebulaâ that is to say, somewhere between 1013 and 1014 . Who can comprehend the number 1013 ? With an effort I can have a feeling for one million, 106 : a million teaspoons of water is about one cubic meter. But even 109 âa billionâis difficult. Do you want to be a billionaire? Put aside a Swiss Franc every second for 32 yearsâthen youâll be one. One million years yields 3  1013 s. String protons together, one each secondâin a million years youâll have a chain barely 3 cm long; string together centimeter-sized pearls, one each second, and in a million years the chain will reach from here to the sun. Lay together an Earth orbit every second, and after a couple million years you will reach the furthest visible spiral nebula (or to be precise, where that spiral nebula was a couple billion years ago, when its light started in our direction). And a last example, which we all know: on a distant island is a diamond mountain, and every hundred years a bird sharpens its beak on the mountain. When the mountain has been whetted away, the first moment of eternity will be finished. Mont Blanc would be whetted away after 1040 s (the Milky Way is only 1017 s old!) and for just as long must one lie proton next to protonâone each secondâto reach the furthest spiral nebula. After this attempt, to make the incomprehensible more comprehensible, I propose my assertion: In order to explore the enormously gigantic (1014 diameters of the earthâs orbit), we must apply our knowledge of the extremely small (10 13 cm). In large things the Universe follows the laws of macrophysics: mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, relativity and hydrodynamics. For most part we encounter conditions that differ vastly from those surrounding us. They are more akin to those present in a nuclear experiment carried out at a cosmic scale. How can the inner structure of matterâthe extremely smallâbe the building principle of the Universe, determining for the large part the emergence of galaxies and stars and the course of their lives? All this originates and depends nevertheless on these so unusual circumstances to which matter is subjectedâor perhaps one should say, conventional conditions, a statement allowing for the fact that the conditions under which we live are extraordinary. Under these circumstances one can anticipate that each new step in understanding the extremely small develops new relationships in the extremely large and leads us further on the way, which we hope, succeeds in bringing us to a new theory capable to explain simultaneously the functioning of the Universe in both the very large and the very small. The most recent step into the very small began a few years ago, and it leads today to few if any consequences for our conceptual understanding of the Universe; I believe, however, that these will come soon. With the last step I am referring to the"

Or the company is owned by the house ownerâs brother, who wanted to help raise the houseâs market value without telling him. In these two cases, most would agree that the house owner is in some sort of way responsible for trying to undo the wrong that happened, even though it is highly unclear how he can succeed in doing that. Similar examples, on a smaller scale and involving the loss or benefit of no more than US$1,000, have been discussed by Daniel Butt, who concludes that the beneficiary principle should not be legally enforceable on the individual level but can play an important role on the level of institutions or collectives, helping these types of agents determine responsibilities based on an evaluation of how much they benefited (Butt 2014). The beneficiary principle of case (3) responds to a certain moral intuition to owe something to those from whose suffering one benefits but whose extent is still to be determined. Obviously the house owner is neither obliged to sell his house at the higher market price nor give the funds to his wronged neighbors. He might, however, be responsible for helping them sue the company. Thus, we deal here with a responsibility that should not be legally enforceable but still has moral weight. We have discussed the beneficiary principle in relation to concrete injustices or wrongs that happen to other persons. But as Young suggests, its moral force also applies to cases of structural injustices, where it is very difficult to disentangle who benefits and who does something wrong. The case of Anne and Sabrina, presented as an illustration of structural injustice, makes this clear. We can think of an employer, for example, who will give Sabrina a job in the future. He pays her a very low salary because of her bad education, and she has to work in precarious conditions. The employer thus profits from an injustice that happened long before he takes advantage of poor Sabrina. He might not even intend to exploit her but is pressured by shareholders interested in high profit. He might sincerely think that giving her a low-wage job is better than no job at all, since she will at least be able to pay her bills and keep her apartment. Still, he benefits from the mere existence of people in vulnerable positions in the labor market, forced to take any job they get. Consumers who buy low-priced products because of the exploitation of Sabrinaâs labor benefit as well. Assuming that they do not know that she works under harsh conditions, what responsibilities should be given them? This small example illustrates how child poverty is, in fact,"

The broilerâs lifespan is only about six to seven weeks, so farmers register the day they get their day-old chicks, and we drip feed SMSs with a comprehensive approach to best broiler practices. These include feeding, vaccinations, hygiene, brooder temperatures, and much more. Another tool is for soils, enabling farmers to learn about the general soils in their area and advising them to have their soils tested while also providing them with contacts for soil testing-service providers. We have uploaded the entire national soils database on the platform, allowing farmers to get loads of information on the particular soil quality in their area and recommendations that allow them to improve their soil quality. Knowing your soil quality or the specific problems of your soil allow you to make the right decisions about fertilizersâwhether to use natural or synthetic and in what volume. Our objective is to enhance the knowledge of the farmer so that he can make informed decisions and decisions he can afford. How did you scale iCow so that it could reach the broad mass of farmers in Kenya? Initially, I had wanted to keep iCow agnostic across the three mobilenetwork operators, because I did not want to push the decision as to which network to choose onto the farmers. Later, because of our marketing strategy, we were fortunate enough to form a partnership with Safaricom. In the early phase, we did a lot of prototyping, tweaking, and product development, resulting in a good product that users liked. Our data showed that within three months of being on the iCow platform, farmers were beginning to see an increase in yields of between two and three liters of milk per animal. Our exclusive agreement with Safaricom gave us access to their marketing machinery and we used a variety of different channels to market iCow. The response was astounding. At one point between 8000 and 14,000 farmers signed up on our platform every day, and eventually our system crashed. Once we hit 182,000 users in our database, we realized that our back end was not up to the task. Messages did not get sent, and our system became unreliable. We had to redesign iCow in its entirety."
143,517,0.954,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"The application required approval from the Central Bank of Kenya, which Joseph found difficult to obtain without my ministryâs support. After seeing a demonstration, I concluded that M-PESA was easier to use than Posta Pay, a government-owned money transfer app used by the Postal Corporation of Kenya and so I promised to support the project. I contacted the Central Bank in order to get support, allowing Safaricom to test mobile money transfer in Kenya. The then acting governor of the Central Bank, Jacinta Mwatela, was extremely cautious and understandably so. In the 1990s, Kenya had lost about USD600 million through false claims to the governmentâs export-compensation scheme. The Central Bank had paid out these monies to a company called Goldenberg International Limited, ostensibly as an incentive to boost exports of gold. Investigators later found that no gold was exported or that it was gold smuggled in from Congo. Because of her negative experience with Goldenberg, Mwatela declined to support M-PESA and advised me to do the same. She doubted the novel project and eventually asked me to put my request in writing. In response to my letter, Mwatela sent four members of her staff to meet with Safaricom executives and me. They were clearly impressed by the presentation, although they made no promises. The bank directed that our ministry, which was responsible for both Posta Pay and Safaricom, take the responsibility for the oversight role. I accepted. At the same time, I decided to seek the bankâs formal approval through the Treasury. I wrote a letter that I hand-delivered to Permanent Secretary Kinyua, who by virtue of his position also sat on the bank board. At the time, there existed neither a policy nor a legal framework for the M-PESA kind of technology, which informed my decision to hand-deliver the letter. Had I simply mailed the letter, he would have marked it for a senior official to look into existing policyâand naturally, because the policy was nonexistent, my request would have been rejected. I explained to the permanent secretary that Kenyans needed a quick and efficient way of sending money and that the existing Posta Pay transfer could not possibly deliver the efficiencies implicit in the M-PESA model. As an economist, the permanent secretary wondered whether M-PESA could affect the money supply and cause disruptions. However, the plan was that Safaricom would work with the banks to execute the"

It seems appropriate to show in this volume how things worked and what obstacles needed to be overcome in a new field of research that was recently born and rapidly advancing. The science policy decisions to be taken meant that 1â2 weeks were important, while a document could take as long as 4 weeks to travel between Geneva and Frankfurt. The lectures given at the QM2 meeting play an important role in the report made by Maurice Jacob on 22 June 1982 to the CERN Scientific Policy Committee, see Chap. 29.

14,49,0.954,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"consequences, according to Anthony Giddens (1993). Trafï¬cking was certainly an unintended consequence of the girlsâ and boysâ decision to migrate in search of work. Had they known that they would be maltreated, insufï¬ciently compensated, and isolated from the outside world, they most likely would not have agreed to leave even the most poverty-ridden native village. Without a crystal ball to show them the future, they made the best decisions they could under the circumstances. They owned these decisions even when they desperately wanted to leave the trafï¬cking situation. It is worth mentioning that some of the adolescents did not ï¬nd their circumstances as dire as child advocates would have the public believe. Several of the Peruvian boys trafï¬cked to work in the construction industry wanted to stay with the same employer, but hoped that service providers would be able to ensure that the boss paid them what he promised, gave them cigarette and lunch breaks regularly, and treated them with respect. Law enforcement alleged that sixty per cent of the adolescent girls were trafï¬cked for sexual exploitation despite the fact that many of the girls were adamant that they were neither involved in sex work nor sexually abused. One ICE agent told me: âLook, when I see young girls with lots of make-up wearing low cut blouses and the shortest skirts you can imagine, of course I am going to conclude that they were trafï¬cked for sex. Maybe nothing happened yet, but whether they realize it or not, the intent was obviousâ¦â In interviews, the girls presented different assessments of the situation. Magdalena said: âA short dress accentuating my ï¬gure does not mean I am a prostitute!â They liked pretty and revealing clothing. Tight and low-cut blouses made them feel sexy and sophisticated, they said. I thought that there was a lot of cultural misunderstanding, both on the part of the law enforcement and on the part of the young girls, about what was age-appropriate attire and what was not. The girls also said they had certain freedoms to make decisions. Naya claimed: âIf I wanted to go upstairs with the men, I could earn a lot more money, but I didnât want to sell myself. I made the boss lots of money dancing with the customers and selling them high price drinks.â The police did not believe the girls and the girls said the police lied. Both parties contested each otherâs perceptions of the situation. While many anthropologists theorizing agency (Tsing 2000; MacGaffey 2000) have a very celebratory view of the concept, Julia Meredith Hess and Dianna Shandy (2008) suggest that, at the juncture of migrant children and the state, this view is more constricted. The same can be said about trafï¬cked children. The politics of compassion governing the lives of trafï¬cked (and other unaccompanied) children tempered the agency of the trafï¬cked girls and boys in my study. The decisions law enforcement and service providers were making were glossed over as âbeing in the best interestâ of the youth. Perhaps it was in the best interest to classify the trafï¬cked girls and boys as âvictimsâ in order to provide them with the legal assistance and social services they needed to stay in the United States."

Firstly, among paid paternity leave recipients, the existence of company-based rights had a legitimizing effect of menâs use and access to leave. They considered paternity leave as a new social benefit they were entitled to. For instance, even if Oscarâs supervisor criticized his leave pattern, he was determined to use it according to his family needs. Jules also noted that with paternity leave implementation, a change in representations was initiated in the work place, as this citation suggests. As soon as I announced to my colleagues that we were expecting a second child, itâs clear that just as when a woman announces it, everybody thinks âmaternity leave,â they also think âpaternity leave.â (Jules, social worker, 35)"
57,41,0.954,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","most Maghreb researchers do not apply for it. India officially requires a research visa, but despite being formally democratic, it is very restrictive in giving out visas for any politically sensitive research, such as in our case repression in the context of subnational authoritarianism, but also, for instance, on the Maoist insurgency or other armed groups, or any research on Kashmir. Our first visit to the field was often different from subsequent experiences in terms of our purpose for going. Our Iran researcher came primarily to study the language, our Kazakhstan researcher was working for an international organization, and our India researcher felt that, as a master student, the line between just âhanging outâ as someone who is interested in the country and being there as an academic researcher was still quite fluid. Once we were set on our career course, this kind of convenient ambiguity has tended to dissipate. Even our China researcher, a Chinese national who grew up in the country, now clearly goes as a researcher, not just someone visiting home. So, how do we enter the country nowadays? Sometimes, we go on tourist visa. Tourist-friendly countries like Malaysia, Morocco, or Mexico make it very easy to enter the countryâindeed Europeans can stay in Morocco for three months without even applying for a visa. There is something uneasy about doing research on a tourist visa or without a permit, especially where a research visa or permit does in fact exist. But a tourist visa does not imply that we are treating the purpose of our presence as a secret. We all carry letters from our home universities, signed by a head of department or university official, explaining our research, but we have rarely had occasion to produce them. Our Morocco researcher writes âstudy, work and tourismâ or âwork and tourismâ on her immigration form. Our India and Mexico researcher has conducted interviews with local policemen and magistrates while on a tourist visa. The experience is that state officials are not in the habit of questioning whether one has a research visa or permit: how you came into the country is not really their concern. Nonetheless, the lack of an official stamp of approval can make us vulnerable, or at least make us feel vulnerable. Our Morocco researcher applied for official approval for her research on Salafists after experiencing intrusive surveillance, an experience detailed in Chap. 5. She applied not because she expected to get permission (and indeed she never received a response to the request) but simply in order to signal that she was not doing clandestine research."
193,322,0.954,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"As on many Sundays during my fieldwork with Ukrainian migrants in Rome, I took the metro to one of Romeâs three Ukrainian Greek Catholic Churches (UGCCs). But this Sunday was different. This Sunday I would begin to understand the contours of Ukraineâs transnational nation-state building process. I walked into the church and was surprised to look out onto a sea of orange. There were over 400 Ukrainian migrants, most middle-aged women labouring as domestic workers in Italy, wearing orange scarves and other orange paraphernalia. The crowd was showing solidarity with Viktor Yushchenko who, after questioning the integrity of the 21 November 2004 presidential election the previous week, sparked protests that came to be known as the Orange Revolution. I saw an informant near the back of the church and went over to say hello. She introduced me to her friends and putting her arm around my shoulders told the group that I was there with her in St. Peterâs Square this week when Pope John Paul II acknowledged the events in Ukraine saying, âBeloved, I assure you and all the Ukrainian people that I am praying these days in a special way for your dear homelandâ, a phrase I had heard repeated with satisfaction by Ukrainians all week. As the conversation changed to women reporting on phone calls with their children who had joined the protesters in city squares or other contacts on the ground in Kyiv, our attention was diverted to the parish priests. The priests solemnly processed into the church past a large orange flag with âTak Yushchenko!â (Yes Yushchenko!) in large block letters and began the liturgy. Weeks later as the protests continued, Father Petro explained to me that the UGCC could not take sides in the contested presidential election. Yet when I asked about the reports of UGCC priests in Kyivâs Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) supporting the protesters, he conceded, âThe Church is on the side of truth and justice, and it happens that Yushchenko is also on the side of truth and justiceâ! As I interviewed priests and parishioners over the following weeks I heard informants construct themselves as actors in Ukrainian nation-state building. In 2000 the UGCC had just two parishes or communities in Italy and by the Orange Revolution there were 90 and growing. Father Boryslav explained that creating Greek Catholic communities throughout Italy was about growing the Church, but it was also about creating a particular ânational consciousnessâ: Well, the community gathering for lunch [in the church basement] after the liturgy was also a moment when we could sing our national songs. In this room, all the events that happened developed a national consciousness. You see the people that come here, the majority have lived through communismâ¦.[I]f before we started meeting and celebrating the liturgy people were afraid to tell Italians that they are Ukrainian â not Russian â and have a rich culture, afterwards they started to say âwe are Ukrainian and our culture expresses itself in these waysâ.1"

This âpastoral governanceâ, stimulating man to govern himself through confession, is arguably also a mantra in mediation. A smaller group of participants, described as the uncompromising victim and the resentful offender,14 presented resistance against entering into the roles in the Christian-cultural âscriptâ. These âoutliersâ can be viewed in the light of Foucaultâs words: âThere is no power without revoltâ (Foucault 1999). For these participants, the mediation session became a struggle to redeï¬ne the situation. An example of this is a mediation session where a resentful offender with some luck redeï¬nes the session from a situation where he should be the one to regret a situation to where the victim should express fault and regret. The way this is done is by claiming that the victimâby reporting the criminal episodeâis responsible for the judgment of the offender. The case highlighted below was about threats towards a caseworker who had decided that a father, for a given period of time, should be denied access to his children. In line with the notion of positioning, the offender (re)positions the caseworker as someone who was supposed to help him and is thereby especially obliged to show loyalty, as illustrated in the following statement taken from the mediation session: I only have you Camilla (the caseworker), I havenât got anybody else, and (looking at the mediator) she cannot handle me. (Turning back to Camilla) I have to go back to jail because of you. I was only judged because of you."

That, and the ease and inexpense of deleting digital images and taking new ones, allows us to control the way we are represented to a far greater degree than in a photobooth or holding an analogue camera up to a mirror. Writing a diary is also a way of externalising our thoughts and the way we see or think about ourselves. A private, paper diary may be written for a future self who will look back upon the time of writing. Although wearable devices like Fitbits or apps like Moves or Runkeeper generally suggest we share our steps or runs or productivity in social media, many (perhaps most) users prefer to keep their activity data private, or to only share some of it. When we share photos of our children or a new home or a night out with friends our target audience is not just our friends, but also ourselves. Social media is about communication with others, but we should be equally aware of how we use social media to reflect upon ourselves. Creating and sharing a selfie is an act of self-representation â which as Gunn Enli and Nancy Thumin (2012) note, means that it involves the creation of texts which will be read and interpreted. A selfie also exists in a social context, once shared. But just as importantly, creating and sharing a selfie or a stream of selfies is a form of self-reflection and selfcreation. As readers, we encounter other people in social media as texts. From our perspective their self-expression is self-representation. This is particularly true when we are readers more than participants. Until the late 1990s, being on the Internet typically meant communicating with peers, on Usenet discussion forums, IRC, MUDs and MOOs. Early online diarying communities similarly emphasised the community and the social aspects of online diaries. In her study of Internet usersâ experience of being online, Annette Markham (1998) discusses the relationship between our bodies and the virtual online experience. There werenât many photographs on the Internet in the 1990s. Few people had digital cameras or scanners, and download speeds were so slow that images took a long time to load anyway, so our bodies for the most part were hidden. We imagined that the Internet was disembodied, anonymous and virtual. It wasnât until the late 1990s and early 2000s that webcams became popular (Senft 2008), and we began to communicate with each other visually as well as through text. The shift to the visual on the Internet and especially in social media has increased a lot since then.

252,40,0.953,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Establishing Ethical REsponsibilitiEs in thE contExt of Vaccination This chapter is about the ethical obligations or responsibilities1 pertaining to vaccination of three different actors. As we shall see in more detail later, there are three possible bearers of ethical obligations: individuals, collectives, and institutions (such as states). Thus, one could ask whether any individual has a moral obligation to have themselves or their children vaccinated against common infectious diseases, such as the seasonal flu, mumps, measles, rubella, and any communicable diseases that pose major threats to the health and even survival of individuals. Alternatively, one could ask whether our community, as a collective, has a collective ethical obligation to realize herd immunity and what it means to have a collective obligation. Or, again, one could ask whether institutions have an ethical obligation to enforce policies that ensure a communityâs realization of herd immunity against certain diseases. Since I am looking for a philosophical justification for any such ethical obligation, the central parts of this chapter will be rather technical in philosophical terms. Unsurprisingly, the fact that vaccination decisions need to be taken at three different levelsâindividual, collective, and institutionalâgenerates conflicts of values within and between these levels. In particular, when grounding any ethical obligation to be vaccinated or to vaccinate oneâs children, and when legitimizing any coercive policy that forces individuals to vaccinate themselves or their children, a first ethical problem may arise from a conflict between individual best interest and individual autonomy. A second ethical problem may arise from a conflict between individual autonomy and public health. If my arguments are sound, I will, by the end of the chapter, have solved both problems and provided a philosophical justification for certain ethical obligations at each of the three levels. Before presenting this philosophical justification, however, let me say something more about the two ethical problems I have just mentioned, so as to give the reader a clearer view of the challenges ahead. Let me start with the first problem, namely, the possible conflict between autonomy and best interest. With regard to child vaccination, one might think that it is quite uncontroversial to say that there is an individual ethical obligation to vaccinate oneâs children in order to protect their health: after all, being protected against an infectious disease seems From now on, I will use the terms âmoralâ and âethicalâ, as well as the terms âobligationâ and âresponsibilityâ (when referring to forward-looking responsibility), interchangeably."

13,160,0.953,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"In this case Gerd comes close to a disidentification with her mother. She explains her own choice of having only one child with reference to this: she wanted to have time for the child. She also mentions her own mastery of fine needlework, one of the few things that her clever mother was not good at. In contrast to this ambivalent description of her mother, she describes her father with tenderness and compassion, but also portrays him as a weaker figure who died early of the hard work. âFather was too good to liveâ, she says, still sorrowful after so many years. She has fond memories of how she sat on his lap as a little girl when her mother was away and that he had sweets in his pocket. When she came of age, their relationship became more distant, but she still treasures one memory from her youth when her father took her in a cab to the nearest town to buy her clothes for the upcoming confirmation: âyou can decide for yourself, he said, yes, both shoes and a hat and gloves, and I â¦ yes, he gave me thatâ. What we see in the stories of all these women are variations of a tension between an ambivalent identification with the strong mothersâ world, to which they belong, and a positive but socially impossible identification with the idealised fathers, who live in a bigger world that is inaccessible and sometimes even unthinkable for them as girls to strive towards. This psychological tension may have been intensified in this generation of youth through the signs of a new and bigger world brought to the most remote farming communities in this historical period by budding communication technologies: radio, films, magazines and the first traces of youth culture and youth fashion. The rural working-class girls, who were not to the same degree protected by the high status of female work that characterised the traditional farming culture, seem to have been attracted to this modern world quite early on. Thus, they dethrone their mothers in a way that we will see became the general pattern in the next generation. Another sign of an emerging bigger world at this time was the increased geographical mobility. Many of the women talk about aunts and sisters who made it to the city or even to America. They may criticise and envy these women, especially if they were their sisters, but also criticise themselves for not being bold enough to do the same. For some it was because of external restrictions, while for others it was their own fear or ambivalences that kept them back. Johanna says that listening to"

In response to the beneficiaryâs call for help, the initiator will launch the protest. As a matter of fact, all the protests we studied derive from a social tie between the beneficiary and one or several citizens. The initiator is not chosen randomly â he or she is a person whom the beneficiary can trust and expect help from. We observe that the social tie between the beneficiary and the initiator is âweakâ, rather than âstrongâ (Granovetter 1983). The migrantsâ strong ties, that is, their close and affective relationships, generally prove less helpful in improving their situation since they often lack the knowledge of migration policies or the tools (e.g., influential network) to initiate support activities. Consequently, the beneficiary turns towards acquaintances they feel can help them, making an instrumental use of their weak ties to members of the established civil society. Even though there is no close or affective bond between them at that moment, the beneficiaryâs situation will trigger feelings of compassion and indignation in the initiator (Goodwin et al. 2004, 422) and encourage them to act, as one beneficiary says: [She] was my sonâs teacher. When I explained the situation to her, she got angry. She said: âBut how can that be? How does that work? This isnât true, this isnât possible!â Afterwards it is [she] who helped me a lot.

In Finland, the short paternity leave that is taken when the child is born has become normalized and it seems to be self-evident also at private-sector workplaces. When we interviewed human resources managers about leave take-up, they told us that taking paternity leave is automatic or even desirable. Some collective agreements provide full pay during 2 or 3 weeks of paternity leave, and there are also organizational practices that encourage fathers to take their full 3-week paternity leave. Parental leave, however, is still often seen as an exceptional and private matter. Male employees are not necessarily encouraged to take longer leave periods, but if they apply for a parental or care leave they usually will be supported (Salmi et al. 2009). The interviews with the stay-at-home fathers show that it is still easier to negotiate a longer leave period in public sector workplaces than in private sector companies. Aki used to work in the private sector when his child was born. He then changed to the public sector and finds the take-up of his latter leave period much easier: In the private company it was more difficult. But I was also quite sick and tired of that place so I did not mind telling them that Iâll be off now. My current job is in the public sector so basically I simply notified the employer about my leave. When I was interviewed for the job I asked if I could start later after my leave and they accepted.

Rust is a new systems programming language, developed at Mozilla, that promises to overcome the seemingly fundamental tradeoff in language design between high-level safety guarantees and low-level control over resource management. Unfortunately, none of Rustâs safety claims have been formally proven, and there is good reason to question whether they actually hold. Speciï¬cally, Rust employs a strong, ownership-based type system, but then extends the expressive power of this core type system through libraries that internally use unsafe features. In this talk, I will present RustBelt (http://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt), the ï¬rst formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of Rust. Our proof is extensible in the sense that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can say what veriï¬cation condition it must satisfy in order for it to be deemed a safe extension to the language. We have carried out this veriï¬cation for some of the most important libraries that are used throughout the Rust ecosystem. After reviewing some essential features of the Rust language, I will describe the high-level structure of the RustBelt veriï¬cation and then delve into detail about the secret weapon that makes RustBelt possible: the Iris framework for higher-order concurrent separation logic in Coq (http://iris-project.org). I will explain by example how Iris generalizes the expressive power of OâHearnâs original concurrent separation logic in ways that are essential for verifying the safety of Rust libraries. I will not assume any prior familiarity with concurrent separation logic or Rust. This is joint work with Ralf Jung, Jacques-Henri Jourdan, Robbert Krebbers, and the rest of the Iris team."

His review was quite positive (!) and from that time we developed a long-lasting friendship. Later, both of us were associated with the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and together we supervised a few students, introduced new courses (e.g., puzzle-based learning), worked on several research grants, and wrote a few research papers. He, with his wife Ewa, visited us in the United States and stayed with us in our home; they also planned to visit us in Australia. Unfortunately, time had run out for him. It is my privilege to write the foreword for this book. First, I consider Witek one of the best friends I had in life. Second, his warm personality, sense of humor, and amazing intelligence made him a very special person in the lives and careers of so many people. Finally, the book covers many topics that were close to Witekâs heart âfuzzy sets, fuzzy systems, Ordered Fuzzy Numbersâto name a few. He also had a keen interest in applications of his research, and thus the third part of the book contains 11 application-oriented chapters. Witekâyouâll live in our memories forever. We miss you.

According to development manager Viktor (p17, 33 years) âblat is not so relevant for young people. Many of them do not know, cannot imagine what blat means.â The hesitation of still another of our respondents, a director under 30 years of age, lends support to this: Blat â it is a tough word. If you define it formally â¦ how would you define it formally? (director, p10) Varied opinions were expressed about the existence, nature, and specificity of post-Soviet blat. A director-owner of his own company, aged 50 (CEO, p16) â who thus had his own experiences of Soviet blat â compared blat to âprotection.â A technical director under 30 (p11) saw blat as a Russian version of a universal way of acting that is not inherently immoral. Despite these variations, a common view was that blat still exists in the public sector and big state-owned companies. In particular tenders organized by the state-related actors were considered to be impossible to win without blat, bribes, or both. The founder of a young and small company expressed this explicitly: We [respondentâs firm] probably have not yet reached the level where you participate in tenders, but I know that they are indeed won by those who have acquaintances. If, for example, the five leading firms of my field try as hard as they can, the tender will be won by those with connections anyway. (technical director, p20) Another respondent doing business with state structures refused to answer this question (âconfidentialâ), but the third respondent, working in system integration, confirms the quote above: In fact, in some market segments it [blat] definitely exists. This was particularly visible in system integration which is closely related to the state purchases. It is practically impossible to win a tender without corresponding connections, friends, acquaintances, kinfolk. But this is actually no secret. I am not revealing any secret.

282,86,0.953,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"embedded in concrete social structures, it is questionable whether social contract thought experiments can create impartial judgements.91 But this critique is much less damaging for the argument on accountability proposed here. It acknowledges that individuals are socially embedded and pursue particular interests. In fact it is because humans have different conceptions of the good and different interests that appropriate accountability structures are necessary. Recall that hypothetical or ex-post delegation creates an obligation for the agent to act in the best interest of his principals. Accountability structures are necessary to prevent the abuse of authority and to enable the autonomous principals to articulate their specific interests and preferences. The communitarian, Marxist and feminist critiques may thus be problematic for social contract theorists, but they attack other assumptions made by contractarians and do not question the construct of hypothetical consent or delegation itself. There is, however, another challenge against the social contract that is more directly relevant to the argument proposed here. An important number of thinkers deny that a hypothetical contract can be binding. Ronald Dworkin, for example, argues that hypothetical contracts do not supply an independent argument for the fairness of enforcing their terms. A hypothetical contract is not simply a pale form of an actual contract; it is no contract at all. [â¦ I]t may be that I would have agreed to any number of [â¦] rules if I had been asked in advance [â¦]. It does not follow that these rules may be enforced against me if I have not, in fact, agreed to them. (Dworkin, 1973, p. 501)92 Contract thinkers have reacted in different ways to this charge. Rawls argues that even if hypothetical agreements cannot bind, the concept of the original position is significant because it describes the conditions under which individuals agree on a political conception of justice that we consider fair (Rawls, 1993, pp. 24â7). Similarly, Thomas Scanlon is prepared to admit that hypothetical consent is mainly used as a heuristic device or a metaphor to help unearth what we believe is âreasonableâ or âjustâ. Other contractarians including Jeffrey Paul, Samuel Freeman, Brian Barry, Gerald Gaus, Christopher Morris and James Fishkin agree with Dworkin that a hypothetical contract may not be binding. Nevertheless they argue that it has argumentative force as a justification for specific norms.93 Cynthia Stark suggests distinguishing between a contract that is morally binding and one that is enforceable. She proposes that a hypothetical contract is binding in the sense that it justifies moral principles and gives individuals reasons why they should comply with these norms. But she argues that hypothetical consent is not sufficient for justifying governmental enforcement of these norms (Stark, 2000)."

Most of the children who helped out in their families emphasise that it gave them a feeling of belonging. The work could be strenuous, but it is never described as negative, as the long and cold walk to school and back was, for instance. Johanna (b. 1910), who grew up at a small farm and worked as hard as Martha throughout her childhood and youth, explains why she did not mind helping out: âI wanted terribly to be part of what was happeningâ. There was generally greater flexibility in womenâs work both for the rural and urban children: girls would often assist their fathers as well as helping their mothers, whereas very few boys assisted their mothers with work inside the house. Both girls and boys remember it as positive to help their fathers outside. The only boy who reports that he and his brothers (he had no sisters) helped their mother in the kitchen on a more regular basis resented it and much preferred helping their father. He remembers with disgust that he and his brothers were called their motherâs âlittle servantsâ (Martin, from a smallholder family, b. 1905). Brothers also got more free time and their education was given priority over that of their sisters. As boys they were expected to earn their living outside of the family, unless they were due to inherit the family farm. For girls, the responsibility for their families extended into their adult lives, and in the cases where they stayed at home to help out, this meant having to ask their parents for money for all necessities (see Thorsen 1993a). But neither girls nor boys from rural families got much education at all at this time. For economic reasons, it was necessary that they started work early, within or outside the family. The men are brief when they talk about schoolâthey didnât belong there, writing was difficult, they didnât do well: âwell, yes, school didnât go so well for me, I guess you could say â¦ we moved too much â¦ it became too much of a messâ (Anton, from a smallholder family, b. 1900). Work counted more than school where they grew up and it was a relief when they could start apprenticeships as 15-year-olds. The women generally have more happy memories of schoolâoften remembering themselves as cleverâbut the rural girls also saw it as pretty irrelevant even if was enjoyable.

360,142,0.953,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"The one aspect I find missing from this otherwise compelling story is that there is no room here for individual variation of meanings. In particular, the mental realmâ as captured by the TYPE dimension of the dual-aspect lexical items and carried along via the proof-theoretic semantics to full sentence-thoughts is the same for all people, and it furthermore (appears to) contain exactly the objectively true features of the encyclopedic facts in the word-TYPEs when these are manipulated so as to give the meanings for the sentence-thought. It thus cannot deal with issues of false beliefs about items in the world; it will not give any account of why different subjects give individually different results on the many tasks about meaning that have been administered over the decades in cognitive psychology. Although Asherâs theory is not described this way, perhaps the alteration I would advise is to make his theory be a theory for an individual agent, allowing this agent to have his/her own set of encyclopedic âfactsâ for every lexical sense.43 Presumably there would also be individual differences in the underlying inference mechanisms of the proof-theoretic semantics also, another topic not envisaged in Asherâs picture. But this now would leave us without any way to accommodate âreal communicationâ, where the two conversationalists are âreallyâ talking about the same (mental) things. While there can always be some check against âthe objective factsâ due to the objective portion of meaning in Asherâs theory, this will not help conversation that relies on having some mutual understanding of the TYPE-portion of meaningâthe meanings . I leave this problem hanging, as a very important topic still to be solved by any two-tiered theory. And I turn instead to other aspects that need to be dealt with in the subjective, TYPE portion of the theory."
137,126,0.953,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Fathers in the last innovation and deconstruction pattern closely follow the experiences described in the previous profile, but they are more reflexive with regard to the impact of leave on gender roles. The father values becoming a fully independent caregiver and house-person but he also regards the period of leave on his own as a fertile ground for building gender equality. In fact, part of the challenge was to demonstrate to themselves and others that they were capable of expertly combining all these aspects of a âhomeparentâ rather than just caring for a baby during the day. From this perspective the father sees himself as an âegalitarianâ partner who is âat the heart of the familyâ as his wife is. Moving beyond the activities involved in the efficient promotion of work-family balance, the five men in this profile also seek to âtest themselves outâ by embarking on tasks regarded as more difficult, such as having meals ready on schedule, having people in to eat, or planning a heavier task load. They also become more reflexive with regard to gender relations, questioning all differences between men and women which are held to be natural and reflecting on different strategies to build up gender equality in family life. This profile not only strengthens autonomy and bonds but also enables the period of leave to be viewed as a time when parents are able to deal explicitly with âin-builtâ cultural norms. An additional impact underlined by these fathers is the emergence of feelings of competition between fathering and mothering, with the need for some negotiation of when and how each parent spends time with the child and how caregiving is carried I really had to âroll up my sleevesâ. I looked after the baby, but I also did all the housework and made a point of having supper ready on time. So the main advantage of this is that it puts men and women on a par, itâs equates menâs role to the role that was always the womanâs. So itâs a way of understanding the traditional tasks and worries that belonged to women, itâs a new experience from this point of view, it really is! (Samuel, 29, nurse, 1 child). I became more involved in all the daily decisions, for example, giving my opinion on what we should do with the baby. This produced another point of conflict between Sally and me, or rather, something which we have to keep discussing and work out. (Frederico, 35, designer, 1 child)."

The process of writing this book and doing research for it was such an experience. For me, writing a book about Dutch tobacco control policy was the next logical step after more than a quarter of a century of research into tobacco control. I started my academic career developing and studying smoking cessation interventions. In the 1990s I became frustrated by the fact that regardless how much attention and counselling smokers who try to quit receive, the majority of quitters relapse within a yearâmost in the first month after treatment. Realising that even a combination of the best and most intensive treatment does not produce success rates much higher than 30%, I turned to more fundamental questions: what makes cigarettes so addictive, and what can be done to motivate whole populations to quit smoking? In 1998 I started to work for the Stichting Volksgezondheid en Roken (Dutch Smoking or Health Foundation) (STIVORO), the national expert centre on tobacco control. This gave me first-hand knowledge of tobacco control in practice, and I gradually learned about the political aspects of tobacco control.

139,61,0.953,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"1.5.7 Error Messages and Warnings All programmers experience error messages, and usually to a large extent during the early learning process. Sometimes error messages are understandable, sometimes they are not. Anyway, it is important to get used to them. One idea is to start with a program that initially is working, and then deliberately introduce errors in it, one by one. (But remember to take a copy of the original working code!) For each error, you try to run the program to see what Matlabâs response is. Then you know what the problem is and understand what the error message is about. This will greatly help you when you get a similar error message or warning later. Very often, you will experience that there are errors in the program you have written. This is normal, but frustrating in the beginning. You then have to find the problem, try to fix it, and then run the program again. Typically, you fix one error just to experience that another error is waiting around the corner. However, after some time you start to avoid the most common beginnerâs errors, and things run more smoothly. The process of finding and fixing errors, called debugging, is very important to learn. There are different ways of doing it too. A special program (debugger) may be used to help you check (and do) different things in the program you need to fix. A simpler procedure, that often brings you a long way, is to print information to the screen from different places in the program. First of all, this is something you should do (several times) during program development anyway, so that things get checked as you go along. However, if the final program still ends up with error messages, you may save a copy of it, and do some testing on the copy. Useful testing may then be to remove, e.g., the latter half of the program (by inserting comment signs %), and insert print commands at clever places to see what is the case. When the first half looks ok, insert parts of what was removed and repeat the process with the new code. Using simple numbers and doing this in parallel with hand calculations on a piece of paper (for comparison) is often a very good idea. Matlab also offers means to detect and handle errors by the program itself! The programmer must then foresee (when writing the code) that there is a potential for error at some particular point. If, for example, some user of the program is asked (by the running program) to provide a number, and intends to give the number 5, but instead writes the word five, the program could run into trouble. A try-catch construction may be used by the programmer to check for such errors and act appropriately (see Sect. 6.2 for an example), avoiding a program crash. This procedure of trying an action and then recovering from trouble, if necessary, is referred to as exception handling and is the modern way of dealing with errors in a program. When a program finally runs without error messages, it might be tempting to think that Ah . . . , I am finished!. But no! Then comes program testing, you need to verify that the program does the computations as planned. This is almost an art and may take more time than to develop the program, but the program is useless unless you have much evidence showing that the computations are correct. Also, having a set of (automatic) tests saves huge amounts of time when you further develop the program."

However, it was derailed by the self-interests of a handful of public servants. They were veterans of the system and were able to ignite squabbles between the two public service departments and continue with their âbusiness as usual.â However, all of this offers a great lesson, in that when there is resistance to change and innovation, one must be flexible and react accordingly. One mistake we made in executing a presidential policy was the fact that we dealt with those at the strategic level, ignoring and hurting the feelings of the mid-level managers who usually execute policy. Self-interest and other ulterior motives are often responsible for creating paralysis in policy formulation and implementation. In retrospect, there are many things that we ignored and that led, as a result, to our policy failure. We should never have assumed there would be no resistance from Postal Corporation. Had we applied interactive decisionmaking theory to the Postal case as in the other cases, we might have succeeded. Without making any assumptions, we should have involved many more stakeholders, who would have prevailed on the officers to let go of their personal motives.

113,211,0.953,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"MALEVOLENT PLACES, BODIES, AND METAPHYSICS As Malinowski alludes, there is a certain geographical division between the domains of sorcerers and witches, though these are by no means mutually exclusive. In the northern regions of Kiriwina Island, sorcerers dominate. This is, not coincidentally I think, the ancestral homeland of the highest-ranking of the Trobriand matriclans, including the Tabalu clan, to which the Paramount Chief of the islands must belong. The long-standing seat of chiefly power, Omarakana Village, is where the Trobriand Paramount Chief resides and is also home to stones that only he can manipulate to bring rains or drought as he sees fit. In the south, as well as in the smaller outer islands of the Trobriand groupâthe areas to which the chiefs and leaders of the northern district travel by kula canoe to exchange valuables, often across dangerous seasâis where witches predominate. My own fieldwork was mostly carried out in the village of Yalumgwa, in the north, the domain of sorcerers. While I was sometimes told that my adoptive father had to be careful to avoid being poisoned by sorcerers, as his own father was purported to be, I was not led to believe that I had anything to fear. Mataâs father had been sorcelled because of his own ambition; he had built a yam house, though he was not himself a chief, and this was seen by the rightful chiefs of the village as subordinate and a challenge to their authority, according to my adoptive mother. Mata kept his own ambitions far less lofty, to avoid a similar fate. And if sorcerers were something to be aware of, they were inevitably amongst us, and we simply had to manage the risk.

315,291,0.952,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"The cumulative, intercultural, intergenerational and dialogic analysis of these discourses, representations and narratives is undertaken through interpretation by the team as a whole. It draws on what Soulet (2012) calls the realistic imagination, a constrained, collective, interpretative activity. The constraints are those of thoroughness, authenticity, relevance and recognition of subjectivities. This analytical activity is implemented both through a conceptually designed interpretative framework and within a grey area, even a margin of discretion, occupied by the different members of the team. Searching for meaning leads to an intergenerational and intercultural reinterpretation of histories, practices and representations. The research team, fueled by the participants they encountered, reveals new configurations of meaning which provide a different take on the intergenerational relations, transmissions, circulations, exchanges, co-constructions and social relations in which they belong. These hypotheses of meaning can thus be applied to texts which give voice to the actors and to the collective imagination of the research team. Each personâs sociological intuition, colored by his or her language and culture of origin, generation, experience and knowledge, and gender, is called upon in a cumulative emic perspective (PaillÃ© 2012); new accounts are redrawn, written and narrated. The examples below illustrate several possible links which give meaning to multistranded discourse and dialogue. Grandmotherâmother dialogue from the same trio through individual interviews. This dialogue demonstrates the intergenerational circularity of the apprenticeships. From my daughter I learned that each one of us can be patient when we want to be.

There was no [public] transport and one had to walk. . . . Therefore my father said that I better donât study. . . . So I took the chance, as my sister came from Playa and asked me if I would like to go there for a vacation. It was like that, that I started to work and stay there."

The crops were infested with pests and disease, failing to grow until we got rid of the hydroponics and put them into soil with drip irrigation in my motherâs garden. In no time, we ended up with a whole bunch of lettuce that we then had to sell with the added value of being cleaned and packaged. That is how Green Genes started which turned later into Green Dreams. We (my family and I) crafted little labels, stuck them on the bag, washed the lettuce, and bagged itâand they sold like crazy. We continued developing mixed lettuce bags that were popular in South Africa but nowhere to be seen in Kenya. As the demand grew, we started to involve out-grower farmers in the vicinity, and eventually we had our products in the supermarkets, airlines, and hotels. My role required managing a growing team as well as a growing range of products and customer preferences. After two years and a close call where my mother became quite ill after being exposed to a lethal pesticide, we changed our production system from conventional, using agro pesticides and fertilizers, to organic production, which is better for our producers, customers, soils, and the environment. You worked intensively with Kenyan farmers. Can you give us an idea on what farming is like in Kenya today? As my business grew, I started to look at widening my supply chain and increasingly worked with smallholder farmers as out-growers. A tragic instance where my mother got caught downwind with pesticide and became very sick shifted my mindset about safe food production completely away from industrial production to organic farming. Producing safe foodâcalled organic at the time (we call it agro-ecological today)â is, of course, food that you grow without the use of artificial or synthetic pesticides or toxins. It required educating my entire supply chain on how to produce organically. In Africa, being a farmer is quite different from the heavily subsidized, trained, and incentivized farmer from the West. Here, the majority of farmers are people who just try to eke out a living on their land and sometimes sell some of their produce in the market. Unlike in developed countries, farmers here were not growing only wheat or only maize. Smallholder farmers grow"

To be emotional and open, to do housework and take care of oneâs children are not seen as unmasculine, but rather as desired qualities in men. Stian says that he is ânot afraid to cryâ. Most of them have female friends whom they give credit for having taught them to become better at âopening upâ and talking about feelings. For most of the working-class men at 18, relational talk still tends to be more of a girlsâ thing, whereas the middle-class men demonstrate a much higher interest in interpersonal relationships and psychological aspects than the majority of their fathers did, their grandfathers notwithstanding. But in contrast to the women, who reflect more on their relationships with others and who have a more ironic view of themselves, the psychological perspective of the men is, as in the middle generation, often centred on their own personal development and taken very seriously. Trond, for instance, tells us at 18 that âfinding yourself â¦ I feel like Iâm constantly developing. I think itâs very healthy, I think itâs very healthy always to develop, even if it can be very tiring and very hard always to consider yourselfâ. Still, gender is more present in the menâs self-reflections and the absence of masculinity appears to be more of a threat to them than the absence of femininity in women is to themâor to the women themselves.

This will include the following sub-sections: The Importance of Diversity Within XP, Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias, and ï¬nally The Positive Impact of XP. 3.1 The Importance of Diversity Within XP It may or may not be true that the number of women in XP is a bit higher than elsewhere in the industry, but even if it is, they are still in the signiï¬cant minority. Itâs important that we donât simply sit back, cross our arms and say âOh, we use XP. We donât have a problem with women in IT. Weâve solved that one already.â There is still room for improvement, and XP practitioners have an even greater responsibility than elsewhere in the industry to increase the numbers of women in tech. This is true for several reasons: XP emphasises the importance of seeing things from the end userâs perspective. This is helped when we have things in common with our end users. Obviously those end users are as diverse as our populations are. The more diversity we have within our teams, the better chance we have of appreciating our end usersâ experiences. Also, XP is a forward-looking movement which emphasises flexibility, change and progress. As agilists, we value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, therefore if there is any group of people (for instance, women) whose ability to contribute towards their teams is compromised in any way, then this should be a matter of importance within the XP community."
252,41,0.952,The Ethics of Vaccination,"to be in a childâs best interest, and parents have an ethical obligation to act in the best interest of their children, at least when doing so requires reasonable efforts and the interest being protected is deemed important enough (as seems to be the case for an interest in health preservation and as is certainly the case for an interest in survival). Unfortunately, it is more controversial than it might appear to argue that the best interest of a child can ground an ethical obligation to vaccinate oneâs children. For one thing, as we shall see in a moment, in certain circumstances it is not so clear that it is in a childâs best interest to be vaccinated. Furthermore, even if vaccination is in a childâs best interest, some parents might still claim that they have the right to make autonomous choices about their childrenâs health and about what goes into their childrenâs body. What I have just said about child vaccination applies a fortiori to adult vaccination. While in the case of child vaccination one might argue that parental refusal to vaccinate their children presents a conflict between a childâs best interest and parentsâ right to make autonomous choices about their childrenâs health, the same refusal in the case of adult vaccination does not seem as ethically problematic. At least according to contemporary liberal ethics, principles of self-determination and of bodily integrity outweighs any paternalistic consideration about a competent adultâs best interest: if a competent adult autonomously decides not to be vaccinated, the fact that vaccination might be in her best interest does not seem to imply that the adult in question ought to be vaccinated or ought to be forced to be vaccinated. Besides, as was the case with child vaccination, it is not so clear that adult vaccination is always in the adultâs best interest. Since this last claim has probably raised an eyebrow or two, allow me to elucidate it. Of course, vaccine denialists do share the view that parents have a moral obligation to protect their childrenâs health; however, as we have seen in the first chapter, they do not believe that vaccination sufficiently protects their childrenâs health. While vaccine denialists undoubtedly overestimate the risks of vaccination, we have to concede that, as a matter of fact and for reasons different from the ones they defend, sometimes it is really not in a childâs best interest to be vaccinated. How so? Even those of us who see vaccines favourably cannot deny the fact that vaccines can have side effects, some of which can occasionally be quite severe. Vaccine injury compensation funds (Mello 2008) adopted in many countries, such as the US and the UK (Looker and Kelly 2011) exist precisely because side effects can happen. For example, the MMR vaccine can cause anaphylactic reactions, and according to some controversial evidence (CDC 2018a). The seasonal flu vaccine can cause Guillain-"

This perceived preference by employers contributes in turn to generating a sort of âreflectedâ anti-immigrant prejudice among Roma which feeds itself with economic arguments. Honestly, I do not really like the way foreigners anchor themselves in the district as residents. The time will come when they will look at the people living here â the rooted ones â as if they were nothing. Thatâs why ignoring the Roma workforce is a huge mistake.

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"By contrast, very few North African respondents reported devoting remittances to agriculture, consistent with other literature on migration and development in Morocco (see de Haas 2006 for discussion). What was far more important to Moroccan and Algerian respondents was the education of children, especially a university education. Interestingly, the respondents who stressed education in their accounts were committed to a higher education both for their daughters and their sons, whereas other studies of remittance use in North Africa have found that due to cultural reasons sons are more likely to benefit from remittances for post-primary education (BensaÃ¯d and Ibourk 2008). Given the purposive rather than representative nature of the respondent sample, my findings here may not be indicative of wider trends. Be that as it may, what emerged repeatedly in several of my interviews was the idea that hostel residents had been âworking for the next generationâ, a finding also underlined in a report about the impact of remittances in Morocco (BensaÃ¯d and Ibourk 2008): We didnât get to go to school. We mustnât leave our children like that, without education. (Hamid, 70, Taroudant, Morocco) I have children. They study â because I didnât have the chance to pursue my studies.

252,69,0.952,The Ethics of Vaccination,"In discussing the problem of what should be done to counteract global warming, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong has suggested something resembling the idea I have just put forward. He argued that individuals do not have a moral obligation to avoid taking oneâs car for leisure drives on Sundays to prevent global warming, because the impact on global warming of any individual driving is negligible; rather, as Sinnott-Armstrong argues, it is governments that should intervene to prevent global warming, if necessary by prohibiting individuals from recreational driving on Sundays. What individuals have a moral obligation to do is simply âto get governments to do their jobâ (Sinnott-Armstrong 2005, p. 312), that is, as I have said above, to actively support the appropriate policies. Presumably, SinnottArmstrongâs argument could also be applied to the case of vaccination and herd immunity: individualsâ duty to prevent negative collective outcomes includes the duty to support effective policies with the potential for preventing those outcomes. Contrary to Sinnott-Armstrongâs thesis, I have provided here an argument, based on fairness, to the effect that individuals also have a moral obligation to contribute to the containment of global warming or to herd immunity by avoiding recreational driving on Sundays or by being vaccinated, respectively; they have these moral obligations even if their individual contribution to the collective cause is negligible. In any case, what matters for the purposes of the present discussion is that individuals fulfil their moral obligations to contribute to desirable collective outcomes (such as herd immunity) also by supporting policies that guarantee that herd immunity is realized. Now, as we have seen, Sinnott-Armstrong says that individuals ought to âget governments to do their jobsâ. But what is governmentsâ âjobâ with regard to vaccination policies? In other words, what are statesâ institutional responsibilities? Not everybody will agree with the following principle, and not everywhere is this principle equally accepted, but here I will assume that most people will agree with my understanding: a state has the moral responsibility to protect and promote individualsâ health, especially that of the most vulnerable people (such as those who cannot be vaccinated), by at least controlling those factors that (1) affect individual health, (2) are not under an individualâs control, and (3) that the state can permissibly control. For example, many countries have in recent decades implemented policies prohibiting smoking in public spaces in order to safeguard the health of non-smokers. If I am a non-smoker, other peopleâs smoke in public spaces is a factor that would affect my health, that is not under my"

However, it was generally accepted that GPsâ training did not equip them with the ability to measure an employeeâs capacity for work.87 As this chapter and the oral history testimonies throughout this book suggest, âdiagnoses suggestive of neurosis [were] often vague, and because in the eyes of some physicians and patients, a stigma attaches to mental disorder a more acceptable symptomatic diagnosis may be given on the certificateâ.88 One GP interviewed as part of this research recalled that it âwas a real . . . real problem, having a psychiatric illness on your note. So . . . we would call a psychiatric illness a physical one, because that was acceptable, and it was acceptable to their friends and their boss and everything elseâ.89 Likewise, a senior professor of general practice concurred: âBecause the man didnât want to be labelled as psychological, the doctor would go along with it.â90 The same GP remembered that one of his patients, a senior executive, drove over thirty miles outside the local vicinity to collect his prescription, for fear that someone might discover he was being prescribed psychotropic drugs.91 The situation not only caused problems for patients, but also for GPs who were often placed in a difficult situation when deciding whether or not to issue a sickness certificate. One GP, contributing to a symposium on absence from work in 1969, noted that âworkmen do not usually want to bother a doctorâ and that it was ânot part of the general practitionerâs function to maintain industrial discipline or moraleâ. Indicating how unsatisfactory the whole process appeared to be, he added: âThere was a time in my career when I occasionally tried to refuse people certificates â but in the interest of my coronary arteries, I have given up arguing.â92 Certainly, evidence suggests that workers were often reluctant to discuss the causes of short-term absence with their employers and that some men refused to take part in workplace health investigations.93 Those who did give consent to participate were often impervious to advice about health. An investigation during the 1960s, which explored the attitudes of senior staff in industry towards health investigations, noted that advice on smoking, drinking and eating habits was seldom received positively, possibly due to the employeeâs âreluctance to remember advice which he found unpalatableâ.94 Moreover, studies that featured groups of men who, in statistical terms, appeared to be rarely ill often exposed interesting ambiguities.

She reflects that there is no one else to remember her in relationship to her childhood friend, and first love, Ellen: no one is thinking of us. We no longer exist to anything in the world. Maybe, in that forest thereâs a tree that remembers your touch when you stood there, close against it, waiting for me, over twenty years ago. Maybe that patch of bark you laid your hand on is now farther up the tree than I could reach. (96) In addition to suggesting that objects might hold a memory of touch, this passage also stresses the importance of collective memory. It suggests that if there is no one to share a memory of what is lost, then the loss is felt afresh. Isabelle lost Ellen during childhood but the realisation that there is no one to remember them together, since her parents have now died, produces a second loss. Similarly, when Eldon dies, Isabelle feels it as a loss not only of Eldon, but of the memory he embodied: he was a place she had been that still glows dimly in the memory of her flesh. Now that he has died he has taken their whole shared past with him and she is left â¦ What is she to do with her understanding of him? ... And what about her? Will anyone ever know Isabelle again, as long and as well as Eldon did? He has remembered her, so she doesnât have to â¦ the truth is that Eldonâs death means also that Isabelle will never be as she was, will not exist as strongly as before. (238) This adds a further resonance to the notion, in each novel, of embodied memory. It is not only that the past inheres in individual bodies, but that memory is held collectively by bodies, and the death of the body necessarily involves a loss of memory too. This, in turn, threatens erasure. Isabelle becomes ghostly.19"

But while it could be maintained that the earlier examples of dignity give the reader some information about what it is, the later examples leave the content blank. Schiller demands that we should all protect humankindâs dignity, without indicating what it actually is. And Grossman chooses to equate all that is perfect with all that is digniï¬ed, leaving unclear why he thinks so and what this would add to the concept of dignity. Of course, one cannot generalise strong claims from the above examples, few as they are. But it is nevertheless signiï¬cant that in these selected novels and poems the use of dignity points towards it being a personal characteristic, and that the broader use of dignity in selected ï¬ction tends to be vague. If the foreign visitor who was invoked above were also to judge the football example, she would probably frown and ask how two people (the German and French journalists) could use the same term, âdignityâ, to describe complete opposites. One of the journalists believed that Zidane had lost his dignity by attacking his Italian colleague, the other that he had kept and defended it. Matters would be complicated further if the visitor came across other quotes from the people mentioned above. For instance, Nelson Mandela said the following in an address to the South African parliament to mark ten years of democracy in 2004: âWe accord persons dignity by assuming that they are goodâ (Mandela 2004). This seems to contradict his earlier quoted view that the affluent must never fail to respond to the cries of the poor for food, shelter and dignity. If dignity were equated with being good, poverty cannot take this away or, in fact, make any difference.6 It seems that we have not progressed much in ï¬nding answers to the two riddles, which are, of course, related. The ï¬rst riddle asks why something that is inviolable needs to be protected. This presupposes that human dignity is universal and therefore an intrinsic part of human beings.

309,123,0.952,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"shared with me about a mutual friend who was apparently having a very sexually active affair with a married partner, commented: âNir, we have everything in Hoi An, but quietlyâ. But this tendency to maintain sexual discourse quiet or camouflaged had one salient exception: goat meat restaurants. When it came to these food venues, things were much more explicit and directâthiÌ£t dÃª (goat meat) was an aphrodisiac and men would dine in places that specialized in this kind of meat as a way of enhancing their sexual potency. Coming from the Middle East, where goat meat is quite common but hardly an aphrodisiac, I was intrigued by the idea that the meat of this specific animal was attributed with so much libido. Indeed, the word dÃª or âgoatâ is routinely used in Hoi An for âhornyâ (and note the connotation to the he-goat horns in English too2), and oneâs 35th birthday (which I celebrated in town) is termed ba lÄm dÃª (35 [years old] goatâin reference to the Vietnamese zodiac) is the source of endless jokes about oneâs state of sexual arousal. When I wondered why goat meat was considered such a powerful aphrodisiac, a friend explained: âhave you ever seen goats in the mountains: there are some forty or fifty female goats and a single he-goat. This male goat may mount any of the females any time, and can actually do it.â The he-goat condition was therefore described as ideal from the male perspective: a very large number of available, submissive (and perhaps interested) females; no competition with other males; and no less important: potency to engage in unlimited number of sexual intercourses. This perception depicts the he-goat as the essence of masculinity. Hoianese Goat meat restaurants, like all quÃ¡n nhÃ¢Ì£u, were essentially drinking places. However, they were attributed with specific kind of aura and/or sleazy character: men who frequent these venues were explicitly seeking sexual potency. I asked several friends, men and women, to eat in one of these places but my invitations were all declined with a surprised frown. Eventually, an Australian female tour guide who spent months in town told me that she was craving for mutton and we went for goat meat instead. We came quite late for dinner, and there was only a single man eating alone by one of the tables. This in itself was quite unusual, as in a small town such as Hoi An, meals are very rarely eaten alone, even when one goes alone to the restaurant: there are always people around with who to share the table."

However, with a deep understanding of computing, one can not only raise the questions of morality in more depth, but one can also see that Total Information Awareness is a technically unworkable fantasy (like the Star Wars program pursued by the Reagan administration in the non-fictional 1980s) providing a false rationale for treating everyone as a suspect. In other words, one reason that we must understand computers now is so that we can understand what is happening, and make informed choices, as members of a computationally-steeped democracy.

In a system of holding back, the situation is initially one where farmer A thinks that âI will not offer to help him get the corn into the barn today, because he is not willing to help me tomorrowâ and farmer B thinks that âI will not seek help from him to get the corn into the barn today, because he will not trust me to help him tomorrowâ. Assumptions about what other people are willing to do may be false. The more cemented relation that Hume describes may be what lies ahead if the system of holding back continues without opposition. Initially, false assumptions about a lack of willingness to help may gradually become true, as the relation deteriorates. We can distinguish between fluid systems of holding back, where it might not take much effort to expose false assumptions about the otherâs lack of readiness to help, and a fixed system of holding back, where it has actually become true that the two individuals are not willing to seek or provide help to each other. It is possible to imagine how Humeâs farmers have been neighbors for a long time, and that there was potential for seeking, asking for, and providing help at the early stage. Thirty or so years later, the lack of initiative from any of them to cancel out the system of holding back has created a standstill where both are losers. Time is also a feature in many instances of coping adequately with fallibility at work. If colleague A has spotted that B colleague has misunderstood a routine or adopted a bad habit, the longer A waits to tell B, the more awkward the situation is likely to become. We can imagine that B has misunderstood a particular written form they are using at work, and fills it in wrongly every time.

As indicated above, after conducting 45 interviews, we added a component to the questionnaire, which gauged respondentsâ reactions to the values we have been discussing in this chapter. We asked them which values they considered most important, and which their society did. We had 44 responses from Africa, Australia, Latin America, the MENA region, Russia and Asia. The responses to the added question showed a disparity between the intervieweesâ own attitudes and those they felt prevailed in their own country. Although intrinsic value is popular among the respondents themselves, far fewer thought that it would gain any purchase in society at large. It is also noteworthy that, while the interviewees tended to believe in the social value of the humanities for policy making, they are less sanguine about whether their societies would agree. The same applies to the responses regarding critical thinking and innovation. On the other hand, there is a relative alignment between attitudes on cultural heritage. Yet again, we see that economic value is not something many humanities scholars espouse, though more think that it is something society expects of them. There is clearly more work to be done in future studies on the preferences of humanists."

Today these subsidized service deductions are already in place on the prepopulated yearly tax return form (for more about the annual tax return, see Chap. 2). Such automatization and simplification of what was once an unwieldy administrative task makes for increased acceptance of such services. At the time of my fieldwork about how informal purchases of work were made and justified, I had certain concerns (for more detail about this, see BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2010, Chap. 2). First, it seemed that trust between the informant and me was a necessary ingredient for the interviews to be successful as just posing a question of why and how a person buys services informally could imply accusing this person of illegal actions. This could obviously provide all sorts of repliesâanger, contempt, shame but mainly silence. The informant and I have to have some sort of relation in order to address such questions. Second, more or less every Swede seemed to be involved. Whatever questions you asked regarding informal purchases of work, the answers all seemed to confirm that you could always find what you were looking for (e.g. Portes et al. 1989: 298, Williams and Windebank 1998: 83). Research has also shown that svart arbete is exchanged amongst people of all social categories, ages and political opinions (e.g. Svallfors 1995). Amongst the Limningers, some buy a lot of svart, most take the occasional opportunity to do so and a few refrain from it as much as possible. Thus, looking for an ethnographic field I wanted a group of people who had something in common yet lived and acted in different realms of society. Inspired by Sherry Ortnerâs fieldwork on class in the USA (cf. Ortner 2003), I contacted the group of people with whom I graduated from school in 1976 in a place I call Limninge. This is a small town in the west of Sweden; hence this group of former classmates is thus collectively referred to as Limningers. As we will see, they provide many different views on what ought to be subject to tax and what should not. They represent diverse social categories and live and work in many different ways in cities, townships, and the countryside throughout the south of Sweden. In the midst of life, they share a long experience of work and life and the memory of our teenage years at the same school I attended. This shared memory provided a platform for trust where illegal yet licit purchases were revealed in ethnographic interviews (Davies 1999: 95â6). Although, these interviews are more than ten years old, I hear the same arguments repeated in contemporary Sweden, although less frequently now. The second study derives from three years of fieldwork at the Agency where I followed a risk assessment project taking place in its analysis"

He has quite a good temperament, I do too, actually.â He goes on to describe his fatherâs abilities in sports and how he has supported Erik without putting pressure on him. He thinks their relationship is good, but also that his father works too much and that they could spend more time together.5 The young men tend to see themselves more on a par with their fathers. Whereas the oldest generation talked about personal traits as being âtransferredâ to them down the generational chain and the middle generation used the phrase âto be likeâ oneâs father or mother in a more personalised way, several of the middle-class men in the youngest generation turn the generational hierarchy upside-down. Magne from the middle generation talked about how he inherited moral values from his father, whereas his son Morten says about himself and his father: âWe are different people, but he is quite like me in many ways.â Some of the older fathers are targets of much of the same critique as in the previous generation concerning their outdated masculinity and emotional closure, but the critique is more conciliatory because the sons now know them better as persons. Rune, the son of the upper middleclass Ragnar who described a rather distant relationship with his sons, confirms that they do not talk a lot, something Rune wishes they did. He says his father has a certain âair of a general-directorâ, but also that he is âof the old, kind sortâ. Anders says about his old working-class father Arne: He is like the definition of a 1950sâ1960s type dad, who likes detective novels, and his car, and fixing things, or building things â¦ He is a man totally devoid of interests, in a way, Iâve never understood that about him, Iâve never quite gotten him â¦ It is hard to describe him, very kind, very practical, conservative.

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"Rectifying these inconsistencies and inaccuracies can be a long and costly process (Samaoli 2007), requiring no little time and money if back-and-forth travel is necessary in order to present oneâs correct credentials to bureaucrats in both countries, or attend court judgements, and so on (Hamadache 2002). Such toing-andfroing between administrations in both countries is another example of how states may enforce mobility on the least resourceful (Gehring 2015). For those who are older or whose health is failing, the burden of going to court (and the time that will take) may simply not be worth it. Badr, whose remark about French colonial administrators not doing their job correctly was quoted above, does plan to get his papers corrected at some point. Presently however he hesitates because it is a timeconsuming and complex administrative process. First he needs to find 12 witnesses who will vouch that he was born in 1948 (this is stipulated by Moroccan law, since he needs a new Moroccan birth certificate). Then the case passes to a tribunal and a judge will make a decision. Of course, this is only the Moroccan side of the story, and he is well aware that it would take far longer than his once-a-year month-long holiday in Morocco to arrange, which is why he has not done it yet. It will then be necessary to change all the documentation and records held by the French authorities too. Self-Inflicted Problems and Timetabling Other problematic biographical records are more accurately portrayed as self-inflicted, generating considerable suspicion from administrative authorities. There are three scenarios to note here: (i) those who earlier concealed their true age in order to emigrate to France; (ii) those who âshareâ what should be a unique social security identifier with undocumented kinsmen and/ or compatriots; and (iii) those who have inattentively (or unwittingly) discarded important proofs of employment and income.

She believes this has made her very independent, as well as allowing her to travel as much as she wantedââand I hadnât done that if I had been in a marriageâ. Many of the women from farmer or working-class families, who had less education or educational aspirations, also say that they would have liked to experience the world a bit more or to have learnt more. Some say that their husbands worked too much and were at home too little. Some reproach themselves that they were not curious or courageous enough, or that they were too frugal all their lives. There are some unsettled matters here, but it is important to be aware of the retrospective perspective: at the time of the interview, they knew how radically womenâs lives had changed in their daughtersâ generation. In the end, the vast majority of them conclude that they have been very lucky in life and have no reason to complain.

116,82,0.952,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Theories about human beings, then, can actually have an impact on the object of research. Empirical studies show that business school student do indeed tend to live and decide in accordance with the theory that human beings are self-interest maximizers (Ferraro et al., 2005; Gandal et al., 2005; Molinsky et al., 2012). The educational systems need to take this tendency seriously. Ghoshal argues convincingly that adding ethics courses to the curriculum is not sufficient, since faculty keeps the Homo economicus assumption alive in the standards courses in economics. His contribution sparked a debate about the effects of teaching and theory on business school students (Gapper, 2005; Hambrick, 2005; Kanter, 2005). Here we can add that students who learn that it is always rational to prioritize self-interest will be badly equipped to decide and act responsibly in conflict of interest situations. The behavioural psychologist Dan Ariely tells an interesting personal story about conflict of interest in a public talk on honesty (Ariely, 2012ii). When I first saw a photograph of Ariely, I though there had to be something wrong with it, since his face looked odd, with blank skin on the right side of his face, and ordinary skin with beard stubbles on the left side. It turns out that Ariely was badly burnt in an accident many years ago. His story about conflict of interest is about what happens when he goes to the hospital to see a physician who has treated him over a long time. On this visit, the physician introduced him to a fantastic new treatment that he thought would be ideal for Ariely. It consisted in using technology to tattoo artificial stubbles on the blank parts of his facial skin, making him look more symmetrical. The physician showed him pictures of two patients who have taken the treatment already, and demonstrated the likeness between the real stubbles and the artificial ones. After careful consideration, Ariely decided not to go for this treatment. His answer provoked a shocking response from the physician, who verbally attacked him and tried to instil guilt in his patient. âWhatâs wrong with you? Do you get some pleasure from being asymmetrical? Do you enjoy looking different?â Ariely could not understand the fierceness of this response. He asked a hospital deputy about it, who explained that the physician was working on an academic paper about the treatment, and desperately needed a third patient to take it in order to make the paper publishable in a prestigious journal. That was his motivation for putting pressure on his asymmetrical patient. Ariely sees this as an example of how an excellent physician and a wonderful human being can become a prisoner of his own conflict of DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0011"

They also said âa daughter will be the wealth of another homeâ, or âour in-laws are the biggest problem, they are the ones who want the boys mostâ. In the study, we found no difference in son preference between high and low caste respondents in the village. Meena, a 26 year old mother belonging to the Scheduled Caste, with two daughters and one son, strongly expressed the seriousness of discrimination against girls: Girls have to suffer everywhere: They canât do anything freely. They are killed or burned by in-laws for not bringing dowry. Only if we give her a good dowry will she get a good home. If something happens where will girls go, to whom will they ask for help?

305,176,0.952,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"The inability to clone a qubit has many important consequences. We want to be able to back up files and send copies of files to other people. Copying is ubiquitous. Our everyday computers are based on von Neumann architecture, which is heavily based on the ability to copy. When we run a program we are always copying bits from one place to another. In quantum computing this is not possible for general qubits. So, if programmable quantum computers are designed they will not be based on our current architecture. At first, the fact that we cannot clone qubits seems like a serious drawback, but there are a couple of important comments that need to be made. Often we want to prevent copying. We want to secure our dataâwe donât want our communications to be tapped. Here, as we saw with Eve, the fact that we cannot clone qubits can be used to our advantage, preventing unwanted copies from being made. The second comment is so important it deserves its own section. Quantum Computation versus Classical Computation The qubits 0 and 1 correspond to the bits 0 and 1. If we run our quantum CNOT gate just using the qubits 0 and 1 , and not any superpositions, then the computation is exactly the same as running a classical CNOT gate with 0 and 1. The same is true of the quantum version of the Fredkin gate. Since the classical Fredkin gate is universal and the quantum Fredkin gate using just 0 and 1 is equivalent to the classical gate, we can see that a quantum circuit can calculate anything that can be calculated by a classical circuit. The no-cloning property may seem worrisome, but it doesnât restrict us from doing classical computations in any way. This is a deep result. It shows that if we compare classical and quantum computation, we shouldnât think of them as different types of computation. Quantum computation includes all of classical computation. It is the more general form of computation. The qubit is the basic unit of computation, not the bit. Now that we have seen some basic gates, we will start to connect them together to form circuits."

Suddenly, one or more of the pupils get a flu. We expect that the flu may spread quite effectively or die out. The question is how many of the pupils and the schoolâs staff will be affected. Some quite simple mathematics can help us to achieve insight into the dynamics of how the disease spreads. Let the mathematical function S.t/ count how many individuals, at time t, that have the possibility to get infected. Here, t may count hours or days, for instance. These individuals make up a category called susceptibles, labeled as S. Another category, I, consists of the individuals that are infected. Let I.t/ count how many there are in category I at time t. An individual having recovered from the disease is assumed to gain immunity. There is also a small possibility that an infected will die. In either case, the individual is moved from the I category to a category we call the removed category, labeled with R. We let R.t/ count the number of individuals in the R category at time t. Those who enter the R category, cannot leave this category. To summarize, the spreading of this disease is essentially the dynamics of moving individuals from the S to the I and then to the R category:"

You have to create a vision with a flash of insight from the small number of clues that are found. A true discussion brings a flash of insight similar to that of Holmes to ordinary people like us. An unexpected idea might occur to someone when people with a sufficient accumulation of knowledge keep discussing an issue seriously. This leads to a leap to a new model. We Japanese are not good at having such a discussion. What we have to acquire is such a cultural climate for discussion. The role played by universities is important for structuring knowledge. When the student newspaper of the University of Tokyo planned to run a story titled âThe University of Tokyo 2050,â I wrote the following two things. One is that there will be a major change in the composition of students. Unlike today, one third will be students who come primarily from senior high schools. Another third will be students who return to school after having been in the workforce. Still another third will be students from abroad. Students will diversify to this extent, and faculty members will similarly diversify. The second thing I wrote is that people who conduct research deeply just as it is done today will account for half of researchers, with the remaining half represented by people who specialize in relating different parts of the whole of cutting-edge knowledge held by humanity. That is, we need more people to study structuring and integrating knowledge. It is important to âstructure knowledgeâ and use information technology (IT) effectively, in order to integrate knowledge and to create a holistic vision. IT is good at accumulating and searching information, to begin with, and this is now being networked over the Internet. Therefore, humanity will be able to solve many of the problems it confronts today if knowledge is structured, if IT is used successfully, if discussions are carried out, and if the correct knowledge is employed at the correct place at the correct time. It is precisely for this reason that âstructuring knowledgeâ is essentially important."

We then compared our individual observations, jointly checking the film material again when we found we had noticed things differently. It is from this iterative process that we gained fresh insights into the integrated process of constructing social and physical space. In the account that follows we rely as much as possible on these observations and provide visual illustrations from the video recording. Although we disciplined ourselves to base our analysis on the film material, it is difficult to exclude additional knowledge from our analysis completely, for we had jointly designed and experienced all the sessions.

164,254,0.952,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","on the attachment representations of children. I was particularly interested in understanding how massive trauma events trigger further trauma and psychopathology in children, and whether social trauma has distinctive clinical signatures in that change among communities, families, and individuals from both the inside and the outside. The findings of that work are not the focus here, but rather I present a subset of findings about post-disaster adversity and the social marginalization of young girls who I interviewed in the Kutch district of the western Indian province of Gujarat. I worked there with children who had survived the debilitating 2001 Gujarat earthquake. In order to better understand childhood in the rural Gujarati/Indian context, I interviewed children from both working-class and middle-class families, which also offered a control sample that I needed for my disaster trauma research. Visiting schools in the villages of Lodai and Khengarpur, the city of Bhuj, and in Adriyana in the Surendranagar district was an eye-opening experience for me. While the young boys played with my laptop and camera, and surrounded me asking questions about where I was from, what I would do in my research, and generally sharing with me about their lives in the schools and villages; the girls seemed disinterested, withdrawn, and rarely came forward to greet me. In my ignorance I overlooked this for a while and thought that perhaps the boys were simply less inhibited and that perhaps the girls were not as well-educated or accustomed to outsiders. My âattachment interviewsâ were video recorded and those involving girls were uneventful, as they spoke very little there were often long pauses, and a profound silence would accompany anything they described. They did not make eye contact, there was no liveliness in their tone or discussion content, and I was always struck by something heavy building-up inside myself when I listened to these children. Besides practical details such as the video camera losing power, the interviews were getting accomplished without much content and I was getting behind schedule because single interviews lasted more than an hour. One interview after another felt similar. After nearly 30 interviews with the girls and three to five group exercises with the children my experiences confirmed to me that something was indeed problematic with the girls here. My first reaction was to get irritated by their reluctance, thinking of them as somehow less intelligent or engaging than the boys, who seemed more free spirited and childlike. In psychology as in other disciplines such as anthropology, a researcherâs own feelings and intuition are powerful tools for understanding individuals and social interactions. There were other difficulties that contributed to this situation, such as the impossibility of hiring a female translator for the work with the young girls. No female translator could be contracted because women in this region do not normally travel or work outside their homes or the confines of their own village or town. There was a local saying, âno women stepping outside the darbargarhâ (an ancient fort inside the nearby city of Bhuj), that also seemed to be an obvious boundary for women, symbolizing their confinement inside the old city. Several girl participants were hesitant to be interviewed or tested by a male translator, and the translator, as an adult male, brought a certain power dynamic and unique cultural angularities into the testing situation that appeared to me as if they could potentially interfere with deriving the information needed from the participants. On several occasions I realized that a"
46,157,0.952,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"The fact of being close to the child, the fact that the child is attached to her parents, which is essential to the childâs development, constitutes another strong ground for responsibility. Children depend on having caregivers and being parented â whether by their biological parents or a different person â and it has been shown that continuity of care matters heavily. Parents and caregivers have thus a responsibility solely based on the relation they have to these children, a relation that cannot be broken without causing serious harm. So to our existing list of four grounds on which an agent can be held responsible, we add a new one: the relation of a child being attached to this agent and depending on her to continue to care and take on some responsibility. The different grounds for attributing responsibility have produced different variations of understanding responsibility. In the liability model it is closely tied to causing an injustice; the social connection model attributes responsibility on other grounds, but it is unclear what this means exactly. Does responsibility of an agent of justice imply that she is to blame? Does it imply that she has the duty to act, a duty that can be enforced by others (primary agents of justice)? How is responsibility tied to autonomy and choice, hence the ability to do something different, and how is it related to knowledge and the ability to know about the result of oneâs actions, participating in a web of social relations that are structurally unjust? And what do we want to do with these five grounds? Can they help us rank agents of justice and their responsibilities, for instance? Answering these questions is our aim in what follows. An agent of justice is, so we suggest, responsible if any of the five criteria discussed above can be applied, with two refinements. On the one hand we need to consider knowledge; that is, what an agent of justice has known or could have known with reasonable effort about the results of her actions or the structural injustices she helps to create. The grounds presented by Young, which we also endorse, suggest that not knowing does not mean no responsibilities exist, though it can reduce the responsibility one has. On the other hand we need to put more weight on choice and if an agent might have acted differently or did act differently in the future. The ability to act differently in the past, that is, in creation of an injustice, is important. Nevertheless, the possibility on the part of the agent to alter her actions now and in the future, undoing the injustice or at least helping something change for the better, counts as well. It seems that agents are completely free of responsibilities only if two things can be shown: First, if they did not participate in any actions that led to an injustice or helped create or sustain a structurally unjust"

A âphallicâ, telescopic instrument (Ï) would perhaps have allowed him to emancipate himself from traditional Gerede and palace intrigue, focussed on the intricacies of match-making, but this instrument is missing (âÏ). Hamlet remains a scholar, who reads, talks and writes, but practices with a sword rather than a telescope. Indeed, optical instruments are decidedly absent in his scholarly practice. Science becomes real science to the extent that technicity dominates the subject-object relationship, so that the object a is not only observed and analysed, but also (to a considerable extent) produced by research contraptions. But I will resume my analysis in Chap. 11 to indicate that Hamlet (as an experimental drama) continues to be relevant for understanding research practices up to today."

Further studies of the actual justifications offered by NG employees is needed to document the extent to which moral neutralization has occurred in the processes leading up to habitual acceptance of unsustainable dumping of hazardous waste. Studies in a range of disciplines show that our cognitive capacities are flexible, and that we can gradually come to accept and adopt behavior that initially appeared to be morally questionable. Organizational life can place us at the top of slippery slopes, where the first small steps into dishonesty and cheating can lead to major moral deviances later. One final example is from athletics. Tyler Hamilton was one of the cyclists in Lance Armstrongâs team, and for a long period, he was in the midst of the lies and deceptions designed to make systematic doping to take place without detection. When asked about the cheating aspect of the teamâs activities, he responds: Iâve always said that you could have hooked us up to the best lie detectors on the planet and asked us if we were cheating, and weâd have passed. Not because we were delusional â we knew we were breaking the rules - but because we didnât think of it as cheating. It felt fair to break the rules, because we knew others were too.

Through stepwise and comparative empirical research on media-related changes in certain communicative figurations, we can gain a bigger picture that shows the more complex processes of societal transformations. In this introductory chapter, we want to outline this figurational perspective and in so doing develop an approach for empirically investigating transforming communications. To do this, we will first reflect on our changing media environment, which we understand as marked by deep mediatization. Second, we will argue that mediatization research is right to emphasize the domain specificity of (deep) mediatization. However, we need to sharpen the idea of social domain. On this basis, we want to argue how far it is helpful to investigate transforming communications by analyzing changing âcommunicative figurationsâ. Finally, in the conclusion we will make some remarks about what this means for practical empirical research."
124,301,0.951,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"follow that one does not control which of them occurs when it occurs (Kane 1996, 133â148, 1999a). When the conditions for SFAs are satisfied, agents exercise control over their future lives then and there by deciding. Indeed, as argued earlier, they have what I have called âplural voluntary controlâ over their options in the sense that they are able at the moment of choice to bring about whichever of the options they will, when they will to do so, for the reasons they will to do so, and on purpose rather than by mistake or accident. And note that it is the diminishment of antecedent determining control over any one of the options that makes possible such plural voluntary control over each of them. Indeterminism, by being a hindrance to the realization of some of the agentâs purposes, opens up the possibility of pursuing other purposes, of doing otherwise, voluntarily and rationally. To be genuinely self-forming agents (creators of ourselves), to have a free will, there must at times in life be such obstacles and hindrances in our wills that must be overcome. Self-formation, as I like to say, is not a gift, but a struggle. One further remark about control: For an agent to have control generally at a time t over the being or not being (existence or non-existence) of some event (e.g. a choice) is for the agent to have the ability or power at the time t to make that event be at t and the ability or power to make it not be at t. And in an SFA, one exercises just such control over the choice one makes (e.g. the choice of A rather than B) at the time one makes it. For, one not only has the ability or power at that time to make that choice be, one also has the ability or power at that time to make it not be, by making the competing choice (of B rather than A) be. One has both these powers because either of the efforts or endeavorings in which one is engaged might succeed in attaining its goal (choosing A or choosing B) at the time. And if either effort does succeed in attaining its goal, the agent can be said to have brought about the choice thereby made by making that effort to bring it about. A final objection I will consider here is this: Is there not some truth to the oftrepeated charge that undetermined choices of the kinds required by libertarian free will must be arbitrary in a certain sense? A residual arbitrariness seems to remain in all self-forming choices or SFAs since the agents cannot in principle have sufficient or overriding (âconclusiveâ or âdecisiveâ) prior reasons for making one option and one set of reasons prevail over the other. I think there is some truth to this charge, but it is a truth that reveals something important about free will. I have argued elsewhere (Kane 1996, 145â146) that such arbitariness relative to prior reasons tells us that every undetermined self-forming choice or SFA is the creation of novel constraints upon an agentâs pathway into the future, constraints that are not fully explained or determined by the agentâs past, but are consistent with that past. In making such a choice we say, in effect, âI am opting that these purposes and plans (rather than some others) will be a part of my pathway into the future, my future life. Doing so is not required by my past reasons, but is consistent with my past and represents one branching pathway my life can now meaningfully take. Whether it is the right choice, only time will tell. Meanwhile, I am willing to take responsibility for it one way or the other.â"
299,74,0.951,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"In response I draw on the difference in the literature between subjective well-being (as reported by those studied) and objective well-being. Subjective well-being is surely a much more meaningful and richer concept than that of happiness. Studies of happiness in the hedonic/experiences sense assess how satisfied a person is at a given moment by asking questions such as âhow happy are youâ and âdid you smile frequently yesterday.â In contrast to those seeking to understand well-being, use questions such as âhow satisfied are you with your life in generalâ and âdo you feel that you have purpose or meaning in lifeâ (with possible responses on a ten-point scale). However, this concept raises two questions. First, a relatively minor one, whether all or even most people have a clear and stable conception of the purpose of their lives and its meaningâand to what extent they formulate such notions mainly in response to the questions asked, and whether when asked again, under different circumstances, they would not provide rather different answers. (By the way, this measurement would make young people come off as less well than older ones because many young ones are less clear about their purpose/meaning than older ones). Second, there can be little doubt that people who state that they have a purpose and a meaningful life may be jihadists, gang leaders, produce ads to promote the purchase of cigarettes, or sell subprime mortgages. I see no correlation between being a good human being and leading a purposeful and meaningful life. To get at the moral dimension one would need to ask people what they did during the last weekend; what they would do if everyone in their group did free ride: how improper they consider keeping cash in a found wallet; how they rank inequality versus economic growth; and other such questions. Objective well-being can include moral assessmentsâand anything else those who study the connection wish to include. Examining such studies shows that definitions of objective well-being reflect the values of the researchers, not their subjects. Thus, some students of objective well-being assume that people who live in a society that has a lower environmental footprint than others are more just, and are at peace with others who are better off. Othersâif they have higher income, pay fewer taxes, and are freer from government regulations. That is, this concept moves us in the right direction but still faces two challenges: (a) it mixes moral and non-moral determinants of well-being, preventing us from measuring the moral factor, and (b)"

We can store all our photographs, all our emails and all our text messages. Leaving the personal we also know that Google is trying to digitise all books ever published, that they are pretty close to having indexed all webpages and that they store data about all searches. This is very useful to us. I love being able to use Google Book search to search through old print books, or Google Trends to look at what people searched for in 2006, but it is a huge cultural shift from a very recent time where we had to select what to record, what to save and what to forget or discard. The urge to exhaustively document everything is not new. In the late 1940s, the psychologist Roger Barker led a project attempting to document every moment of ordinary peoplesâ lives, as a counter to the constructed laboratory experiments that dominated psychology research at the time. Roger Barker and Herbert Wrightâs book One Boyâs Day (1951) is a 435 page record of everything that happens to a seven-year-old boy during one fourteen hour day, recorded minute by minute by a team of eight observers. While the book was criticised for its lack of analysis or theory, being nothing but raw data, Barker later published an anthology of studies based on such âbehavior streamsâ as he called them (Barker 1963), coining a term very reminiscent of the streams and feeds of data we create and read today. And yet, even as videotaping made recording simpler, this kind of intense collection of every detail of a personâs life did not become a common methodology until in the last few years, as computers have made it feasible not only to store such detailed logs but also to automatically record the data in the first place and to manipulate and analyse it. The Quantified Self movement with its blogs, conferences and meetups is the personal equivalent to big data: collecting and analysing data about oneself. Barker would have been thrilled to see the detailed streams of information about human behaviour collected by quantified selfers. But despite the promise of âbig dataâ we are still working out what kinds of questions can be answered by the data. Perhaps, as Alessandro Marcengo and Amon Rapp argue, echoing the critics of Barkerâs work half a century ago, Quantified Self âis not something oriented to build DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0006"

51,67,0.951,How Generations Remember,"meaning had changed during the course of the far-reaching changes experienced by Mostarâs society. Two criteria were particularly important to me when choosing my methods and field sites (Map 1.3). Firstly, I aimed to find sites that would give me access to people of different ages, genders and national backgrounds. Since the great majority of Mostarâs inhabitants declare themselves to be either Bosniaks or Croats, almost all of my interlocutors belonged to one of these two groups; therefore I decided to focus first and foremost on them. However, some of my interlocutors did have Serb backgrounds, came from mixed marriages or declared themselves to be Yugoslavs. Secondly, I searched for field sites that would allow me to explore public memory discourses as well as individual narratives of the past. During my entire field stay, but predominantly in my first year of fieldwork, I attended numerous commemoration events, reburials, anniversaries, demonstrations, relevant round tables and book presentations. Commemorations were attributed either to the victims and heroes of WWII or of the war in the 1990s andâto a lesser extentâto prominent local artists. Since the annual calendar in Mostar is full of such commemorations, which are open to the public, these were good entry points for my research. At these events I learned more about public memory discourses and had the opportunity to talk to both the participants and the event organisers. Even if I also paid attention to ritual aspects of these ceremonies, they were not central to the focus of this research. Rather than simply assuming that commemorations are the prime means for maintaining and transferring collective identity, I investigate these events in order to outline the wider social context in which they are embedded (see Vertovec and Rogers 1995).

46,161,0.951,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"equipped to step in and support the family. In a rich society, the state typically meets these criteria. If agents A and B cannot do anything to help, then it is up to the mother to try to find a job, leaving her children alone during the day. But if she cannot find anything or finds only jobs she cannot accept for good reasons, she will be in a situation in which she no longer is able to provide a decent living for her children. In these circumstances, another agent comes into play: a person in her neighborhood, who works closely with the fatherâs employer and who has benefited from the fact that A exploits his workers and his profits are high. The neighbor did not intend to do anything wrong and was not aware of the schemes of his business partner, but he surely benefited; if there is no one else to turn to, his responsibilities are strong. The children themselves have the weakest obligation in respect to their own poverty. The two younger ones, aged one and three, obviously cannot do anything. The older one, aged ten, could work for the neighbors and support her mother and siblings, but from a moral point of view, this fact can confer only very weak responsibilities. Three important things should be noted here. Firstly, in many cases more than one reason to be responsible can be applied. The state, for example, is powerful and has some interest in keeping children out of poverty. Then there might be an uncle that is well off and close to the children; he certainly ought to step in and support the mother if the state fails to do so. It is possible that the state might fail but the society has other powerful institutions like charities. Secondly, responsibility rises if more than one reason can be applied. Take a company that has the means to pay fair wages and provide good working conditions but, due to its focus on maximizing profits, exploits women and hence harms both them and their children. This company is more to blame and needs to shoulder more responsibility than an equally powerful company that makes only moderate profit because it pays fair wages but could do more in respect of better work-life-balance programs for its workers. It is again important to keep in mind that the responsibilities individuals have are attached to their positions within an institution. A politician has the responsibility to make the state and its institutions work in such a way that injustices do not occur or are alleviated; this may happen by trying to increase the working conditions and introduce a minimum wage. As a private person, her responsibilities are different and have more to do with paying a fair wage to her cleaner instead of exploiting her, for instance. Finally, it is possible to construct examples in which arguments speak against our weighting or in which the case is less clear. Such an example would be another very rich neighbor who is powerful but did"

Interviewee B felt resentment that he had been held in a concentration camp, even though he had American citizenship. Also, he stated that he served in the army after the end of the war, but that the choice was not because of loyalty to America but instead the fact that he had no job. Moreover, he emphasized that the discrimination against Japanese immigrants in American society at that time deprived them of opportunities to work. Interviewee C was held in the Granada Camp. She describes her experience at the concentration camp and her identity as follows: I was held in the Granada Camp. I lived in a tiny shack. It was a horrible camp. My parents worked at a vineyard. I had an elder brother. He was drafted as a second-generation Japanese American and went to war in 1944. I spent my years of eighth, ninth, and tenth grades in the camp. Even after leaving the camp, I experienced a lot of difficulties. Since my family had no money, I was taken to my uncleâs. I worked at a strawberry farm for low daily wages. My uncle used to tell me that he had actually wanted to go to Tule Lake while he was held in camp. He thought that, if he was taken to Tule Lake, he could leave America for Japan. Meanwhile, even after leaving the camp, I tried not to talk about my experience there. I think that this was because I had something in my mind that could not be classified as American or Japanese. One day, at school, I wrote my American name. It was soon rewritten as my Japanese name by my Japanese teacher. This was an identity problem. I did not understand what my identity was. Japanese Americans like me often use the phrase âfacial character.â It is something like a surface identity. After the civil rights movement in my living town in 1965, I thought that my name was called for the first time in my life because that was the first time many minorities started to insist their own ethnic identities. For me, it was the identity of a Japanese American. But later, I noticed that I did not fit in it. The 442nd Team as the symbol of the loyalty of Japanese immigrants is irrelevant to me. To make myself fit in it, I had to throw away something. In my case, it can be said that Iâve thrown away my Japanese identity. The âshakingâ of her complicated identity is clearly expressed in her national name. She spent her childhood without a clear recognition of whether she was Japanese or American."

For details on auctions, also see the chapter on Fighting Corruption. Typically, the right to participate in the ï¬rst round of negotiations will go to the bidder offering the highest price. The highest sale price, however, will not always be the best deal. From the perspective of the state, value creation can take many different shapes. More efï¬cient operations, better management, transfer of know-how, and future investment obligations can easily compensate for a slightly lower sale price. In any case, the contract should protect the long-term interests of the state and allow the investor to make a good, clean proï¬t in the medium term. That is why it is very important to deï¬ne and communicate the selection criteria and their weighting upfront: Will the ï¬nal decision be taken based on price alone? Will obligations regarding future investments play a role? What about management experience and technical expertise? Personally, I have found that it is best to use only criteria that can be quantiï¬ed in the last tender and to create a clear-cut formula as to how they will factor in the decision. Qualitative criteria, such as an experienced management team, should only be used in the initial screening stage. In other words, bidders who do not fulï¬ll these criteria should not even be admitted to the ï¬nal round. And once a bidder is admitted to the ï¬nal round, qualitative criteria should not be applied again, assuming that all participants who have made it this far satisfy the governmentâs qualitative requirements. Regarding the ï¬nal round itself, it is crucial to create a formula that all parties understand. This is exactly what we did when we put one of the utilities in Georgia out for tender. From the perspective of the government, it was crucial for the tariffs to stay as low as possible for as long as possible, and we made this clear to all potential investors. We also deï¬ned the investments the future owner of the utility would have to make over the course of the coming years. Based on these preconditions, we asked potential investors to submit proposals specifying tariff levels for the next seven years and the price they were willing to pay. The formula we would apply to select the winning proposal was predeï¬ned and clearly communicated to bidders: a speciï¬c weight was given to the tariff for every year, and these weights added up to account for 50 percent of the decision. The remaining 50 percent weight was attached to the price the bidder was willing to pay. Thanks to the transparent approach, this turned out to be one of the most efï¬cient tenders we ever conducted."
211,6,0.951,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"How do people think? By understanding how people think, we can do a better job of explaining their actions. Both of us (the authors) were drawn to this topic in the extreme context of entrepreneurship. This context is extreme because the actions associated with entrepreneurship can have a substantial impact on the individual taking the actions, the economy, communities, the environment, and society as a whole. For example, to explain why one individual creates a venture to benefit the community (Shepherd and Williams 2014) whereas another individual creates a venture that harms the natural environment for personal gain (Shepherd et al. 2013), we need to understand peopleâs cognitionsâwhat happens in their minds. Not only are the outcomes of entrepreneurial actions extreme (in their impact), but the associated decision making is also extremeâextreme in uncertainty, complexity, time pressure, emotionality, and identity investment. We felt that investigating cognition under such extreme conditions afforded us the opportunity to workâand push forwardâthe knowledge frontier. That is, we were able to take the existing body of knowledge (from relevant literatures on cognitive science, decision making, and other aspects of psychology) and adapt it, twist it, and blend it to make a new form that would explain entrepreneurial cognition.

I did not hear one dissenting voice during 2 years of fieldwork. The overarching narrative is that the men are in France when they are sick and in need of treatment, and then when they are well enough they return home to be with their families and to benefit from the emotional support that the family offers. This narrative can be summed up in the chapterâs title â âHome/Sickâ â a formulation which tries to encapsulate this back-and-forth health strategy. Before continuing, two disclaimers are in order. Firstly, as noted, many hostel residents were very ready to talk about general healthcare needs as a rationale in their return and residence decisions. However, there was an overall reticence to discuss specific health problems in detail. This reticence means that the balance of testimony here is slightly weighted towards the voices of healthcare professionals. This applied to all health issues, but particularly mental health. Saleem, the leader of the Residentsâ Committee in his hostel, put it in these words: As for me, I'm going to try in the future to propose to the management that from time to time â and it's not easy â to have someone who comes here, as a psychiatrist, to discuss things with people. But it's not easy (â¦) everyone has a secret, for any person his problems are his secrets, he doesn't want everyone to know that he â¦ he has problems (Saleem, 60, Tiznit, Morocco)."

An immediate acknowledgement of responsibility may be what the patient or the relatives are want to hear, but the rationale for giving one may not be present. âPrior to an operation, I try to be open about risk to the patients. Sometimes it is difficult to make a precise diagnosis, and we have to proceed without reliable knowledge about what is actually the matter with the patient. The uncertainty means that things might go wrong. Sometimes we operate people for an illness where it is common that about 30% experience more or less serious complications after the operation, and may have to be re-operated. Patients who end up in that category may respond with anger, and expect me to acknowledge a mistake. It would be wrong of me to do that, since we cannot establish whether the current problem is a result of a professional mistake in diagnosing or operating the patient, or not. Absorbing and acknowledging information about risk is difficult for patients and relatives, particularly in the light of a bad outcomeâ (BjÃ¸rnbeth, 2017). Doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth has focused on the learning potential of sharing experiences about unexpected complications and mistakes. One episode from his early career set him on the path to understanding the importance of transparency about fallibility. He was on duty at a hospital when a young girl entered as a patient, with symptoms indicating a broken arm. When studying the x-ray of the arm, doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth could not see any break. In order to be on the safe side, he knocked on the door of his leader, the chief doctor of his unit, and showed him the x-ray. The senior doctor studied the picture carefully, and came to the same verdict as young doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth. The girl had not broken her arm, and could return home without treatment. Later on the same day, another doctor came to the unit, and looked at the x-ray of the girlâs arm. After careful scrutiny, he spotted a break that was difficult to detect, and had escaped both doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth and the chief doctorâs gaze. The girl was sent for again, and this time got the proper treatment in the form of plaster.

We also observed that the business continuity takes a front seat compared the commitment towards transformation which requires extreme courage and ability to take hard decisions that might be easy to take but are hard to live with. During the transformation journey it was very evident that it is far easier to implement and solve systemic obstacles than changing people mindset. Eg. It was easy to improve the CI/CD system as compared developing expertise or making people take ownership and being accountable. Participation of people across the organization itself is a challenge when people are not clear of what the beneï¬t to them is, even after lot of planning and persuasion, signiï¬cant number of people in leadership team felt that there was no need for transformation 2.0 as we had improved on quality and timeliness of deliverables, also among the people who actively participated1 there was a skew towards Scrum Masters and Engineering managers (Fig. 3)."
385,859,0.951,Advanced R,"The key points are: â¢ We step through two iterators (input and output) simultaneously. â¢ We can assign into an dereferenced iterator (out_it) to change the values in out. â¢ upper_bound() returns an iterator. If we wanted the value of the upper_bound() we could dereference it; to ï¬gure out its location, we use the distance() function. â¢ Small note: if we want this function to be as fast as findInterval() in R (which uses handwritten C code), we need to compute the calls to .begin() and .end() once and save the results. This is easy, but it distracts from this example so it has been omitted. Making this change yields a function thatâs slightly faster than Râs findInterval() function, but is about 1/10 of the code. Itâs generally better to use algorithms from the STL than hand rolled loops. In Eï¬ective STL, Scott Meyers gives three reasons: eï¬ciency, correctness, and maintainability. Algorithms from the STL are written by C++ experts to be extremely eï¬cient, and they have been around for a long time so they are well tested. Using standard algorithms also makes the intent of your code more clear, helping to make it more readable and more maintainable."

For the purposes of this book, we have opted to use a very broad understanding of peacebuilding. If not, we would have undermined our attempt to understand how the rising powers view peacebuilding by imposing a definition and approach to peacebuilding influenced by the traditional understanding and approach to peacebuilding. We have thus opted to use a broad understanding of peacebuilding to mean any deliberate programlike effort that has a conflict-resolution theory of change that is meant to influence preventing a lapse into violent conflict or to sustain peace. We have considered using the UN definition(s) and approach to peacebuilding, as it represents a globally agreed concept, but we have found that there is a considerable gap between what many Member States view as the role of an international body like the UN when it comes to peacebuilding, and how they choose to deal with such issues domestically. For instance, whilst the USA engages in debates on peacebuilding at the UN, the concept is not prominently used domestically in the policies or approaches of the US government. We have thus opted against using the UN definition for fear of contaminating our study of peacebuilding in the rising powers by imposing an external concept. Instead we have tasked our contributors to take a âbottom-upâ approach and to seek out national concepts and understandings that approximate this broad theory of change approach to peacebuilding. Even this broad approach to peacebuilding has proven challenging at times. In our concluding analysis, we discuss these definitional and conceptual challenges in greater detail."

How do we know this? How do we know that life will continue so that believers can fulï¬l this role? Initially, according to the Koran, humans were created from a mud which contained all the ingredients of life, into which God blew spirit (Koran 55:14; 32:7â 10). Human fetrah became godlike, and the fetrah was tawheed (Koran 30:30),7 in the best proportions and most beautiful (Koran 95:4; 82:7; 64:3), and God congratulated himself on this creation (Koran 23:12â14). Life could not emerge without tawheed; Imam Ali once said that human beings are microcosms of the entire universe. God created humans and other living beings with dignity and called upon humans to uphold this dignity. Humans volunteered to assume this responsibility, while other living beings did not. However, if in time Godâs earth is not to be depleted of vicegerents, there must be people to carry out the responsibility of acting in this capacity. We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof; but Man undertook it â he was indeed unjust and foolish.

For instance, we can use the predict function to work out values for the response at values of the explanatory variable that we did not measure.

82,75,0.951,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"justification relation primarily a logical relation, as is stated by Richard Feldman and Earl Conee?12 Or should we follow David Armstrong and Alvin Goldman and hold that it is ultimately causal?13 Which answer one gives to Q1 and Q2 depends largely on whether one takes an internalist or an externalistic view of epistemic justification. Our intuitive understanding of epistemic justification, which Kant would have called âconfused and undeterminedâ, revolves around two aspects that philosophers of all times have struggled to amalgamate.14 On the one hand, justification has to do with the way the world is: it would be inappropriate to call our beliefs justified without requiring that they represent, at least remotely, how things actually are. On the other hand, justification applies to the way the world appears to us: it would be awkward to call my beliefs unjustified if I have reasoned impeccably towards a conclusion which, through some freakish turn of fate, happens to be false. The fact that externalists tend to stress the former, world-centred aspect of justification, while internalists emphasize the latter, agent-centred aspect, is reflected in their answers to Q1 and Q2. What do internalists and externalists say about the ontological status of the relata in âA j justifies Ai â? Concerning Ai , the thing justified, there seems to be not much disagreement. In the case at hand, both factions assert that Ai is a proposition, or a belief in a proposition.15 But what about the ontological status of the justifier, A j ? Here the answer depends on which of the many different versions of internalism or externalism we are talking about. It also depends on whether A j is regarded as something that is itself inferred or as suffices to make a proposition a reason for anotherâ (Williams 2014, 237). As will become clear later in this chapter, we agree that a relation of entailment or of conditional probability is not sufficient for saying that one proposition is a reason for another. However, if Williams is implying that such a relation is not necessary either, then we part company. In general, Williamsâ approach to the epistemic regress problem is inspired by the later Wittgenstein and by ordinary language philosophers like Austin, and as such tends to eschew a more formal or theoretical approach, like the one that we pursue in this book. 12 Feldman and Conee 1985; Conee and Feldman 2004. 13 Armstrong 1973; Goldman 1967. 14 Verworren und unbestimmt â see Kantâs treatise âEnquiry concerning the clarity of the principles of natural theology and ethicsâ (Untersuchung uÌber die Deutlichkeit der GrundsaÌtze der natuÌrlichen Theologie und der Moral) of 1764.

78,415,0.951,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"One particular incidence makes up the main background for the argument to be presented below. On July 22 in 2011 Norway faced a tragedy of enormous dimensions. The right winged terrorist Anders Behring Breivik bombed the governmental building in Oslo, the capitol of Norway, and later the same day he cold-bloodedly killed 77 youth of the Norwegian Labour party who attended a summer camp on a small island outside Oslo. In the aftermath it was much debated in the medias how he could possibly be able to carry out this misdeed. We shall leave out all practical aspects here and rather concentrate on one particular moral issue, having to do with toleration. More specifically I shall frame this as a question whether we could possibly tolerate the political opinion upon which this action was based. Breivikâs opinions had been presented in a Manifesto online long before July 22. The author here laid out a conspiracy theory about the threat from inferior races against Arian and European people, and seriously discusses how to solve this problem. Much of his speech is right wing propaganda, presented in a quasi-dialogic form where Breivik interviews himself. Part of the story is his claim that he represents an Heraldic Order lead by himself. Without getting into further details I shall describe this Manifesto as employing fictitious use of reason. One of the issues in the trial was whether there had ever been others but the author himself being a member of this Order. Few believe that there are. For the sake of argument we shall assume that the whole story was fictionalâthere had never been any real public. The main issue is then whether it makes a difference if the public is fictitious, as in Breivikâs case, or rather a real public in the sense of consisting of a certain amount of people. I believe it is not. The most important criterion of the fictitious character is not the amount of participants, but rather the use of reason involved. Thus, the difference between the real and the fictitious is procedurally defined."

Lacanâs downplaying of intellectual property may sound radical but, similar to Perlmannâs Silence, he does challenge us to explicitly consider a concept which is too easily taken for granted in mainstream integrity discourse (which increasingly revolves around a neoliberal framing of the scientist as a textual entrepreneur, scoring citations on the discursive stock market of citation indexes, known as academic publishing). Lacan challenges us to question the P of FFP. In dialectical terms, we initially start from an understanding of intellectual property and plagiarism which seems self-evident (M1). If I am the first person to publish about something (a concept, a formula, an equation, a discovery, a syndrome, a technical innovation, a personality test, etc.), I may rightfully claim it to be âmineâ, so that others should at least cite me as the owner. But further reflection will convince us that we always stand on the shoulders of others, and that every novelty presupposes terms, approaches, techniques, etc., developed by others, so that it seems artificial to consider my contribution as something which belongs exclusively to me, as my âpropertyâ even. In other words, the initial concept of intellectual property is challenged or even negated when the original concept is exposed to actual research practices, as fleshed out in science novels for instance (M2). This is an important experience, for it reveals that mainstream understandings of intellectual property actually build on questionable (neoliberal) framings of scientific productivity, staging scientists as a textual entrepreneurs, scoring citations on the discursive stock market of citation indexes, which allegedly has become the basic objective of academic publishing (which, according to this neoliberal logic, is neither about making discoveries not about working for the benefit of humankind, but about harvesting citations and boosting oneâs h-score). The various instances of plagiarism presented in novels (as literary case histories) expose this symptomatic misunderstanding and the subsequent subversion of neoliberal interpretations of intellectual property in misconduct novels forces us to critically reconsider the original concept and to actively work through the experiences which these novels describe. I will come back to this discussion in the final section, and also in Chap. 10."

To give something creates a relationship, and the focus in this book is on the relations that taxes and taxation, as a process of collecting revenue, create. In this book I argue that in order to understand why we pay taxâthat is, why we accept tax complianceâas well as why we avoid doing so, we have to look beyond legal changes, psychological experiments, economic results, the organization of revenue collection and all actorsâ practices in societyâs tax arena and study the type of relations, and expectations, that taxpaying is seen to create in society. In this quest, returning to Marcel Mauss and his analysis of the gift and its resulting relations will help us understand this. I want to direct our gaze onto the concept of reciprocity, which is often proposed as an explanation in tax compliance research, and explore its diverse meanings and implications. First, taking reciprocity seriously means that we have to expand the view of reciprocity as a dyadic relation between two exchangers to include other citizens/members of society which in matters of taxation is often synonymous with the state. I shall argue that similar types of expectation to those that exist between exchangers reside in the relationship that citizens as taxpayers have with the state. Although exchanges between inhabitants and state are vast even from a daily perspective, impossible to quantify or account for, and immensely complicated in a welfare state, we will see that there is a residual sense of a reciprocal relationship. From a residentâs perspective does thinking about taxes in reciprocal terms also make for demands on the state? Indeed, does paying taxes have an impact on oneâs expectations of what society should provide? Second, thinking about taxation as giving something draws our attention to the balancing that goes on in society. Paying tax means creating and maintaining different types of societal relationship and acquiring an identity in such relationships; giving too muchâor receiving too much for that matterâhas, according to Mauss, implications for the status that one has in society. What is the impact of a given tax system, its redistributive effect and the resulting reciprocal relations it creates on oneâs societal status, oneâs group in society, and oneâs society vis-Ã -vis other societies? Third, I will direct your attention to the actual giving and takingâand the order in which this comesâto explain how cheating by taxpayers can be justified and thus made legitimate (at least in their own eyes). Viewing taxes as a citizenâs explicit economic relation to the state and implicit relation to all other citizens brings us straight to the core of economic anthropology. Our focus thus changes from legal explanations and"

56,82,0.95,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"events in respondentsâ lives â connected to work, family, health, migration etc. â in a chronological order. In addition to the important details of life history which I hoped it would reveal, the life grid was a means of building rapport with individuals, since it required an element of team-working to reconstruct respondentsâ timelines. My hope was that doing life grids would lead naturally enough to longer life story interviews with respondents, but my invitations to âtalk about their life in migrationâ were always met with polite refusal. In my fieldnotes I recorded that respondents âfelt this [request] was too vast, not specific enough. Theyâre not going to want to be that open so early onâ (Fieldnotes 17 May 2009). In time I began to realise that these refusals to be formally interviewed were in themselves revealing of the wider dilemma the hostel residents faced at retirement, and for that reason I have included some of this rich testimony in the Appendix for those readers who are interested. Understanding this reticence to participate was also sometimes a question of interpreting silences and pauses, to read between the lines of my conversations with residents. Although return migration does not appear at first view to be a particularly sensitive topic, this is to forget that the vow to return âone dayâ â and at the latest by retirement â was a collective promise made to thousands of wives and children âleft behindâ in places of origin. Such expectations of return were also part of collective consciousness in the home and host societies, among policymakers and the general public alike. Furthermore, as a corollary of the socio-spatial marginalisation blighting the hostels, I encountered deep suspicion among residents towards the AdomaSonacotra company, and its supervisory stakeholders in the French state. Such suspicion logically extended to research projects facilitated by the company, such as my own. The hostel residentsâ attitudes, bordering on a siege mentality, suggested to me that the accommodation itself had an institutionalising effect on those living there. Indeed research on migrant hostels in both France (Ginesy-Galano 1984; Hmed 2006; Sayad 2006) and South Africa (Ramphele 1993) has made a strong case that such forms of accommodation represent a type of âtotalising institutionâ (Goffman 1968). I began to realise that in order to understand and break down the above barriers to participation, I would need to submit myself in some way to these institutional forces. In short, I realised that I would need to move into a hostel and reside there for an extended period of time. This led me to spend 3 months living in a hostel in a north-western suburb of Paris. Figures 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 provide a photographic glimpse of life there. Ethnographic participant observation is a privileged method to study the effects of such institutionalisation when working with âmarginalâ groups. Indeed, some would argue that ethnography may be more or less obliged when âpoverty, lack of infrastructure, illiteracy, or political violence impede [other forms of] research"" tainty over a sequence of events in one domain, cross-referencing with an event in another domain, for example the birth of a son or daughter, can aid memory for distant events. It is also a flexible tool, allowing respondents to switch to different domains, start, stop or continue at different places, and cross-reference events in different domains (Parry et al. 1999)."

These work like interfaces through which we experience, interact with, and semanticise (in the sense of making sense of, and giving meaning to), the world. In short, we grasp reality through concepts, so, when reality changes too quickly and dramatically, as it is happening nowadays because of ICTs, we are conceptually wrong-footed. It is a widespread impression that our current conceptual toolbox is no longer fitted to address new ICT-related challenges. This is not only a problem in itself. It is also a risk, because the lack of a clear conceptual grasp of our present time may easily lead to negative projections about the future: we fear and reject what we fail to semanticise. The goal of The Manifesto, and of the rest of the book that contextualises, is therefore that of contributing to the update of our conceptual framework. It is a constructive goal. We do not intend to encourage a philosophy of mistrust. On the contrary, this book is meant to be a positive contribution to rethinking the philosophy on which policies are built in a hyperconnected world, so that we may have a better chance of understanding our ICT-related problems and solving them satisfactorily. Redesigning or reengineering our hermeneutics, to put it more dramatically, seems essential, in order to have a good chance of understanding and dealing with the transformations in (a)â(d) and hence shape in the best way the novelties in (1)â(4).

137,312,0.95,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"husbands seemed not to really understand what all the fuss was about. Their general views were that they had wanted to do this, circumstances favoured the division they had settled on and they had no misgivings, were pretty confident that they could handle this. None seemed to think that this was âun-manlyâ or that he was engaged in some form of gender subversion though none had experienced anything similar as a child. These were just âdifferent timesâ. Many were genuinely surprised when I asked them if they had experienced this as something incompatible with a masculine role: âNo it never occurred to me that what I was doing was something unmanly. Why on earth should that be?â [9] The experience of one family [3] illustrates the general trend. The couple has one child together and the woman has one from an earlier relationship that lives with them. Both work on the private market. Their son was almost 1 year old when I interviewed the father. The first month after birth both parents were on leave. After that the father returned to work and the mother was on leave for 7 months. For 5 of those months she also worked 20 % and by doing that she managed to stretch the leave. When she returned to full-time work the father took over on a full-time basis for the 2 months he had left of his leave. Asked about the reasons, he began by stating that they had wanted the child to have as much time with the mother as possible and that breastfeeding should be for at least 6 months and then added: âIt was also that I wanted to have some time with them together and then just with him.â When I interviewed him the child had recently begun with a child minder (a male, which is highly unusual) and they were all very pleased with that person even though the couple looks forward to getting a place in kindergarten for their son. When I asked if it had not been an option to stretch the leave period even more to a similar reduction in compensation he said that financially that had not been possible. And these were the general reasons behind fathers being home alone for a relatively long period. The whole family is at home together for the first couple of weeks or even longer. This is the period when they are all getting to know each other in their new roles and a period where the mother needs rest so that is the main role of the father, keeping family and friends at bay and making sure that the mother is not overburdened by domestic chores. Then the fathers return to the labour market and return to the domestic life after 6â8 months to cover as much as possible of the period until a place in kindergarten becomes available. It was natural in all cases that the mother should be at home for at least 6 months both because of breastfeeding and because the parents deemed that important to ensure a good bonding between mother and child. After that period there was increased room for negotiations and individual solutions. But these were always with one goal in mind, namely to delay as much as possible the time when the child would have to be put into other peoples care. What was mainly to be avoided was to use private child minders. Some were uncomfortable with the thought that there was only one grown person taking care of up to five infants while others were more concerned with the costs. The labour market situation of the mother played a role (when was it necessary for her to return to work) but all the fathers added that they had wanted to do this in order to better bond with the child. In some cases that"

However, More sought Conwayâs advice in particular regarding his niece âMrs Laddâ, who was suffering from breast cancer, because of Conwayâs close acquaintance with âMonsieur Van Helmontâ (son of Jean Baptiste Van Helmont). Via Conway, Van Helmont sent prescriptions to More and Mrs Ladd which are not detailed in the surviving documents, but, judging by their effects, contained some potent chemical and organic components. Beginning optimistically, Moreâs letters described his hopes of a cure for his niece, and told how he had informed her of Van Helmontâs âfameâ in Europe, hoping that âit may contribute to the efficacy of the medicineâ.105 Within a month, however, Mrs Ladd began to experience the side-effects of her treatment. Her physician informed More that the medicine produced no alteration in her till the Sunday following, she has been these three dayes ill at her stomack, hot and thirsty, with frequent shootings in her breast, and not only on the cancerâd part, but likewise round about it there are many little angry pustulats, first red, afterwards maturated on their heads.106 Nonetheless, seeing some softening of the tumour, Mrs Ladd was persuaded to carry on. Over the coming months, she repeatedly complained of pain and fever, sometimes declining to take the remedy, then consenting to its use once more. In December 1674, More wrote to Conway: I hear from Grantham also that my Neece make use againe of the Plaisters ... But in a letter December 3 my Nephew writes thus, Though my sister be advised from ragley to proceed in the use of her plaister, yet I doubt she needs further advise what to doe; for besides the paine and disturbance it hath given her, it has much encreased the bignesse of the soar which is all in such fretting distemper. This makes me tell Dr Clark that he must judge upon the spot. And I beleeve he does not deele so openly with me as he should, out of a nicenesse to displease me, Because of my great opinion I have expressed of Monsieur Vanhelmont. So that I am something at a losse what to doe in the case and dare over sensibly presse the use of the plaister upon my Neece. For feare of the worst.107 Shortly after, he reassured his correspondent that âwhat ever it be I shall account myself much obliged to Monsieur Vanhelmont for his good"
247,58,0.95,Humanities World Report 2015,"can communicate insights from their research through similar media, as well as book reviews. That the humanities have such a role may seem obvious, but it turns out to be a disputed area. Academic research in literary criticism, art history and music has certainly had an aesthetic function in the past. Nowadays, there is no shortage of critics outside academia, writing and talking in the media, who aim to guide the general public in its appreciation of different kinds of artwork. But is this something modern-day academics do in the humanities? In the case of literature, it may actually be controversial to attribute such a role to researchers, perhaps because of trends such as postmodernism or, more generally, the âdemocratisationâ of public life, and hence the demise of academic expertise in matters of aesthetic appreciation.31 It was notable that very few of our respondents mentioned aesthetic appreciation as a value of the humanities. Here are two exceptions, both from North America: NA11: I would remind [an impatient and potentially hostile audience] first, that the way they live their lives and the pleasure they get from the world, some high percentage of that comes from their education in the humanities. Learning how to distinguish between good [and bad] forms of communication ... , between canned and serious things, between superficial things and profound things. And this doesnât just go for aesthetic experience, but just being an intelligent consumer of media, politics, business and sciences. Again, I know this sounds old-fashioned but it helps people think broadly and deeply with discrimination. If they donât care about that, then thereâs not really much to say. You canât convince them. NA14: Iâd prioritise aesthetic appreciation, i.e. the way research can make possible new and sophisticated forms of aesthetic pleasure. This is bound up with the way it shows how aesthetic pleasure has changed over time. But note that in the first of these quotes aesthetic value is mentioned only briefly and is considered âold-fashionedâ."

She rightly wanted to give visibility to a behaviour which, she suggested, should serve as a model for others to follow. Many, including all the newspapers that reported the news, had the same reaction as the Italian Minister of Health. In a note on the high school website, the class described their decision to be collectively vaccinated as an âact of solidarityâ towards Simone. There is no doubt the classâ decision was motivated by noble sentiments and that, considering that many of them would not otherwise have got vaccinated, it was in fact an act of solidarity. This nice story is particularly suited to introducing a book on the ethics of vaccination for three reasons. First, it clearly illustrates, on a small-scale scenario, the practical application of a concept with great ethical relevance when applied on a large scale, namely, that of herd immunityâa concept I will return to later in this chapter and throughout the book. Second, the story shows why we need to develop an âethics of vaccinationâ, as the title of this book suggests: being vaccinated is a decision that not only could benefit the vaccinated individual but alsoâand indeed more importantlyâcontributes to protecting other people around us, thus raising the distinctively ethical question of whether and to what extent we should do something that is not only or even primarily in our self-interest (actually, the individual benefit of vaccination will be minimal or even negligible in some cases, as we will see in Chap. 2). Third, the story suggests that protecting vulnerable people through herd immunity is a collective enterprise, that is, something individuals cannot do alone but need to do together. The collective nature of the effort gives rise to a collective action problem and a tension between collective and individual responsibility. Such tension calls for a philosophical inquiry that can yield precise ethical and, ideally, political prescriptions. The philosophical inquiry around collective and individual responsibilities will be dealt with in Chap. 2. The policy implications, viewed in light of a principle of least restrictive alternative in public health policy, will be the subject of Chaps. 3 and 4. In this first chapter, I will discuss some of the sources of the ethical problems raised by vaccination and some of the ethically relevant facts about vaccination, clarifying the exact scope of the present discussion and what important ethical issues will be left out. This book will be successful if, at its conclusion, it will have convinced the reader that in a world where people simply behave in a minimally ethical wayânot heroically, only decentlyâa case like that of the Italian high school class should not be seen as particularly praiseworthy.

333,13,0.95,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"The distinction that Feynman makes here shows how he sees his work as intrinsically interconnected with the symbolic system that he is working with. His ideas do not occur separately from their realization in written symbols; rather, they emerge through interaction with that symbol system. It is the same as with Du PrÃ© and her cello, where there is no music without both the artist and the instrument being present. Indeed, the process of coming to be able to operate fluently and effectively with tools and symbols is common to all learners as they appropriate the practices and âhabits of mindâ of a discipline. The human mind (and indeed the human brain) re-forms itself to accommodate these new discipline-speciï¬c ways of operating. For instance, Donald (2001, p. 302) has explained that literacy skills transform the functional architecture of the brain and have a profound impact on how literate people perform their cognitive work. The complex neural components of a literate vocabulary, Donald explains, have to be built into the brain through years of schooling to rewire the functional organization of our thinking. Similar processes take place when we appropriate numbers at school. It is easy to multiply 7 by 8 without representational supports, but if we want to multiply 12,345 by 78,654 then we write the numbers down and follow the speciï¬c rules of the multiplication algorithm. It is because we have been able to internalize reading and writing and the decimal system, that we are able to perform the corresponding operations with an understanding of their meaning."
123,6,0.95,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"is able to convince him that they are any better, since their claims to wisdom do not hold up under critical scrutiny. Socrates, at least, admits that his beliefs about the world and society may turn out to be false, and so he may be the wisest, in the sense that he realizes the limitations in his own convictions and beliefs about the world (Plato, 1966). There is a Socratic quality to the intervention from the pushback tractor driver at the airport, a willingness to challenge a person in power, in the name of doing things right together. He persists with his questioning even after he has experienced rejection and irritation from the higher ranked person on the receiving end of his messages. Socratic philosophy is practical at heart, both in the sense that it can address concrete questions about how one should act and live, here and now, and in the wider sense of being oriented toward the goal of leading a richer and better life. It rests on an assumption that an examination of personal beliefs, desires, and habits can lead to significant breakthroughs of knowledge regarding how to live a good life. You may come to realize that your current priorities and ways of living are not consistent with what you actually value and see as important, and so have reasons to make changes. We can interpret âKnow yourself â as a recommendation to look inwards, to examine oneâs own feelings, desires, commitments, preferences, and habits. Another interpretation of the Socratic motto is that the process of attaining self-knowledge requires you to look outwards, and take note of your own place and role in a community. Who are you among these people? How is your life and your aspirations connected to what other people are attempting to do in their lives? This relational dimension of being a person can be lost if Socratesâ motto is understood solely as an exercise in inward meditation on what matters in oneâs own life. Self-examination in the Socratic sense can consist in an inward and an outward orientation. The former may be the one that springs to mind when we read the motto in isolation, but the latter discloses the social dependencies of human endeavors, and is essential in attempts to understand fallibility at work. A Socratic examination of life at work can consist of asking questions that highlight relational and collaborative aspects: How is what you are trying to achieve at work dependent upon your colleaguesâ efforts?

50,49,0.95,"Seeing Ourselves Through Technology : How We Use Selfies, Blogs and Wearable Devices To See and Shape Ourselves","Choosing what technology can do Filters can appear to be deeply technological: a new iPhone can count our steps with its M7 or M8 motion sensor and its accelerometer, gyroscope and compass, and it can use its microphone to measure how loud our surroundings are, but it cannot measure â at least not directly â our emotions. Our cameras know when we point them at a face, and can even wait until the person smiles before shooting a photo, but they cannot measure whether we love that person or not. Our bodies themselves are technologies with their own constraints and affordances: we can see colours and use language but cannot hear as well as dogs or navigate using biomagnetism and sonar as whales and dolphins do. Our brains and senses filter our perception of the world. In addition to technological and cultural filters, we have these cognitive filters that we cannot completely escape, although drugs, diseases, surgical implants and body modifications can alter them to some extent. Individual devices have technological filters that are themselves influenced by cultural filters. For instance, an iPhone can track motion but not heart rate or the sweatiness of the palm holding it. It could have been designed differently, and we can study reasons why the choice has been made to build it only to perceive certain inputs. Of course cost and technological development are very important factors in determining what kinds of technological filters are built into a device, but many technological filters, whether they are built into hardware or software, are very deliberate cultural choices. For instance, the creators of the app SkinneePix, which lets you take selfies that show you looking skinnier than you are, wrote in a comment to an article about the app in The Guardian on 4 April 2014: âWe developed SkinneePix as a result of friends (mostly DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0004"

118,598,0.95,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Where is this question asked? If it is asked in developed countries, such as the U.S. or Japan, with the money and resources that those countries have, and the high level of education of the population, there are a number of choices for electric power supply and the population has the ability to correctly select them. Therefore, we can easily move to the next question. However, if it is asked in developing countries, where rapid energy growth is a requisite condition, and the population does not even know what would be the consequences of their choices, there comes another question very difficult to answer: is it ethically preferable to ensure their rights to select the energy sources? To whom is this question is asked? If it is asked of an individual, and if that individual is an expert, he (or she) might try to quantitatively analyze the risk and the benefit based on the data he has, include some of his personal perceptions, and finally give you the answer. (Perhaps this is also what I am going to do.) If not an expert, he might emotionally give you the answer based on the information he has. But when it comes to a decision of a country or a society, apart from achieving the utility (by quantifying the risks and the benefits and make sure that the benefits are worth the risks), the fairness among the society members must also be taken into account by some means or other. When is the answer needed? In the case of decision on the energy policy of a country, when it has money and resources, which means it has the chance to choose its preferred energy resources, the answer to the question âare the benefits of nuclear power worth the risks?â might not be needed until the next decade or even the next century because its energy production potential is several times the demand. On the other hand, for a country with small potential, it might need the answer within several years or even several months. In that case, the only thing it can do is to try to improve and make use of the tool (risk-benefit analysis) it has, and set up some system to obtain as much as possible the perceptions of its public. Under this circumstance, regarding the results of risk-benefit analysis being done by developed countries, even after including the social impacts (public anxiety or opposition movements) or ethical issues (which came up in the answer to the first question) to be observed, I still personally think that the benefits of nuclear power in Thailand are worth the risks, for the time being. However, this is based on the present information I have. If in the future, the possibility of severe accidents is to become tens or hundreds of times what we see now, and the social and economic impacts are proved to be much larger than what they are now, this evaluation may change. In my personal view, the most important thing is to be able to judge the risks and benefits under the present circumstance with limited information, and take responsibility for the judgment, no matter whether you are an individual, an expert, or a decision maker."

2,301,0.95,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"For each dimension, I developed indicators that allow for the observation of variations as well as comparisons. For the dimension of choice, I looked at the capacity users have to choose a provider when they initially become users of a service and to what degree they may exit an institution. I developed two indicators for this dimension. First, I assessed if the opportunity to choose and exit providers is important for power relations. Choice gives power to users if municipal or institutional representatives report changing the content of a service in order to avoid user exits or attract more users. Likewise, usersâ perception of exit as a tool for obtaining changes indicates that they have power as opposed to situations where there is no exit opportunity. There is a continuum between no exit opportunity and full exit opportunity. Second, I evaluated whether the opportunity for choice leads to a wider range of services for citizens. If users are able to choose alternatives that constitute distinct services from those offered by public providers, the entire scope of public service becomes broader. When public services can cover a broader range of citizen preferences, the capacity for active citizenship is expanded. Indicators of empowerment focus on two forms of user influence. First, I mapped how user boards take part in steering and influencing the activities of institutions. The accessibility of user boards and their level of influence are central components of this measure. Second, I examined how users experience the opportunities they have to obtain changes through day-to-day interactions with other users. I evaluated participation by looking at arenas where users have access to decision makers at the municipal level, and I examined how representatives and decision makers perceived user influence in these arenas. I also looked at municipal interest organisations, like councils for the elderly, which channel the interests of users toward the municipal level. In some cases, these channels were missing altogether."

It is hard to understand that their parents are getting divorced, and some ï¬nd it strange that the parents have not told them before. The relationship breakdown between their parents has come like a bolt out of the blue for many of the children, something which they are unhappy about and wish to communicate back to their parents. Some children express anger, but the most prominent feeling in this category is sadness. They spend a lot of time thinking about what has happened, and many say they sometimes cry. Many ask the mediator to tell their parents that they need more attention and to be comforted. Others communicate a wish for their parents not to constantly ask how they are, because it makes them cry. Many of the children say it is good to be able to talk to someone other than the parents. It also emerges that the children worry a lot, both for themselves and for one"
310,126,0.95,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"following the recent spike of religious terrorism across the EU, several Maltese people have started to develop an Islamophobic attitude: (104) â¦ even for people who have no problems with Muslims per se, but then, when you start seeing your, I guess, people feel nervous when they see their neighbourhood being transformed um, you know, with the appearance of a mosque for instance, um, they feel uncomfortable with that. So, â¦ less people would be inclined to defend immigrants who are calling for these changes. (P1, FG1) (105) And it used to be âtake over, you know, Muslims will come and they will take away our strong catholic.. And everythingâ¦â They takeâ¦ (P3, FG3) (106) Yeah, yeah, yeah, thatâs what they do all the time. Weâre not against muslims, weâre against Islam as a religion or whateverâ¦ (P2, FG3) Overall, collectively looking at these points raised by our interviewees, what seems to be the underlying cause for the notably different perception ofâand attitude towardsâthe LGBTIQ and migrant minorities is a strong and rather homogeneous sense of social identity that the Maltese appear to have; a social identity that ï¬lters migrants (or to put it more aptly, some particular groups of migrants) out and retains the LGBTIQ community as part of the Maltese in-group. Given that âoneâs social identity is a product of the social relations one is embedded inâ (van Houtum and van Naerssen 2002: 132), this is not entirely surprising, if one takes into account the extremely small size of the country and the additional premise that âin Malta there has been a historical fear of invasion by non-Europeans and non-Christian people that has lasted throughout the centuriesâ (van Hooren 2015: 91). That said, not all is lost on this front, since, by deï¬nition, social identities are âprocesses of continuous âre-writingâ of the self and of social collectivesâ (van Houtum and van Naerssen 2002: 132). Thus, it seems that the more the Maltese are exposed to multiculturalism, as they have increasingly been in recent years, the harder it will become for them to tolerate xenophobic speech altogether."
117,170,0.95,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"This example shows Leandra doing will-work. She wants to shower Ms Koch.16 In order to do this, she needs Ms Koch to want to shower, or at least to not refuse it. Leandraâs initial use of the generic âyouâ indicates that entering the room cheerfully is a more general way of approaching residents. But she then adjusts to the person herself and to the severity of the residentâs condition, as is evidenced in Ms Kochâs example. In other words, generalisations are not useful here. To get Ms Koch to want to shower, Leandra attempts to sculpt her mood. Although sometimes ânothing worksâ and wanting remains not amenable to Leandra to work upon it, sometimes it does work: in those situations, Leandraâs smile causes Ms Koch to âalso become cheerfulâ, to âmagnify the emotionâ and to relax. This, in turn, results in her allowing Leandra âto do moreâ, including giving her a shower. In another example of this way of doing will-work, Joani often brought three cups of hot chocolate to Ms Veenstra along with her medicine. We drank the chocolate by her bedside together. Meanwhile, we talked about the weather or what we had done yesterday, or about the joint breakfast awaiting her downstairs. By doing this, Joani hoped to get Ms Veenstra into the mood for getting out of bed, and it often worked. In those cases, what Ms Veenstra wanted was aligned with Joaniâs desire for her to have breakfast, and for her to be with others. Sculpting moods and emotions is one way to align wanting. Two important conclusions can be drawn from this. Firstly, the story affirms that moods and emotions cannot be separated from wanting.17 Secondly, it shows will-work as a relational practice: Ms Koch and Leandra are"
252,87,0.95,The Ethics of Vaccination,"authors who define coercion in psychological terms, that is in terms of influence of a certain proposal (or policy) on a personâs will (e.g., Frankfurt 1973; Feinberg 1989). More specifically, coercion can be conceived as a condition in which someone is forced to do X, for example, vaccinating oneâs children, in the sense that she is left with âno reasonable choiceâ or âno acceptable alternativeâ (Wertheimer 1989, pp. 30, 36â37) but to do X when she would otherwise not choose to do X. In other words, in cases of coercion a personâs autonomy is infringed upon in a certain specific way, i.e. by making certain choices unreasonable or unacceptable, and by subjecting her will to the will of another (Frankfurt 1973, p. 80), where this âotherâ might be a state. Coercive interventions thwart autonomyâas I have defined it aboveâto the extent that they render unreasonable those choices that individuals would otherwise make on the basis of their own evaluation. Importantly, on the account of coercion I endorse, someone could be coerced into doing X not only by a proposal that attaches penalties to not doing Xâthat is, a threat, for example, excluding unvaccinated children from schoolâbut also by a proposal that attaches significant enough benefits to doing Xâthat is, an offer (Held 1972; Feinberg 1989; Frankfurt 1973), for example, giving very large financial incentives for vaccinating oneâs children. Thus, the definition of coercion I have provided differs from âbaseline accountsâ of coercion. According to these, what is relevant for the definition of âcoercionâ is the distinction between threats and offers, as defined by prospected changes with regard to a certain baseline. The idea behind baseline accounts is that coercion necessarily involves a threat, and offers can never be coercive (e.g., Nozick 1969; OâNeill 1991; Wertheimer 1989; Beauchamp and Childress 2001, p. 95). According to Nozick, one difference between threats and offers is that only the latter preserve freedom; that is, âwhen someone does something because of offers it is his own choice, whereas when he does something because of threats it is not his own choice but someone elseâsâ (Nozick 1969, p. 459). This view, however, overlooks the influence on individual decision-making that very appealing offers can have. The account I endorse takes instead such influence into consideration. In some cases, for example, when the recipient desperately needs money, offers can leave the recipient with no reasonable choice but to accept what is offered, for example, a financial incentive, and to comply with the conditions of the offer, for example, vaccinate their children. In this sense, we cannot exclude that a certain offer might constitute a form of seduction (Held 1972) to which it is difficult or impos-"

In contrast, others in the West view Islam as an inherently violent religion. This view has proven particularly popular among Republican presidential candidates. Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and two-time Republican presidential candidate, said, âThe Muslims will go to the mosque, and they will have their day of prayer, and they come out of there like uncorked animalsâthrowing rocks and burning carsâ (Wing 2013). Our extensive study shows that both views ignore that the Qurâan and Hadithâ like Christian and Jewish textsâcontain passages that justify violence and others that reject it (Etzioni 2007). Both are part of Islam. The Qurâan does include an exhortation to âSlay the idolaters wherever you find them,â (Q 9:5) and says, âI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of themâ (Q 8:12). In the Hadith, one reads âI have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allahâ (Sahih Muslim 1.9.30) and, âKilling Unbelievers is a small matter to usâ (Tabari 9:69). One may call them warriors11; âjihadistsâ seems closer to the common parlance. One finds in the same texts, âAnd do not take any human beingâs lifeâthat God willed to be sacredâother than in [the pursuit of] justiceâ (Q 17:33), and again, âThe taking of one innocent life is like taking all of Mankindâ¦ and the saving of one life is like saving all of Mankindâ (Q 5:33). There are also exhortations to peace and compassion in the Hadith: âSomeone urged the Messenger of God, âCall down a curse upon the idol-worshippers!â whereupon he said: âI have not been sent to curse. I have been sent as compassion.ââ (Muslim 6284). And again: âA strong person is not the person who throws his adversaries to the ground. A strong person is the one who contains himself when he is angryâ (Al-Muwatta 47.12). These are the texts on which non-violent, moderate Islam draws. It should be noted here that the opposite of our definition of âmoderateâ Islam is not necessarily âconservativeâ or even âfundamentalistâ Islam, but specifically violent Islam. Thus, the objective should not be to try to rebut entire branches or schools of Islam, but rather to specifically counter violent teachings. This is significant because most of the moderates we discuss below are still illiberal; that is, they abhor violence but do not necessarily embrace human rights, in particular womenâs rights and free speech. And when they state that they favor âdemocracy,â they use the term rather differently than Americans do; for instance, one Tunisian leader explained that he favored democracy because it provides full employment. A very telling example of the two iterations of Islam is the two views of âjihad,â a term which literally means âstruggle.â It is interpreted by those who view Islam as"

305,18,0.95,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"each time we do it the initial conditions vary slightly. These slight variations can change the outcome from heads to tails and vice versa. There is no real randomness in classical mechanics, just what is often called sensitive dependence to initial conditionsâa small change in the input can get amplified and produce an entirely different outcome. The underlying idea concerning randomness in quantum mechanics is different. The randomness is true randomness. The sequence NSSNNNSS â¦ that we obtained from measuring spin in two directions is considered to be truly random, as we shall see. The sequence of coin tosses, HTTHHHTT â¦ appears random, but the classical laws of physics are deterministic and this apparent randomness would disappear if we could make our measurements with infinite accuracy. At this stage it is natural to question this. Einstein certainly did not like this interpretation, famously saying that God does not play dice. Couldnât there be a deeper theory? If we knew more information about the initial configurations of our electrons, couldnât it be the case that the final results would no longer be random but completely determined? Couldnât there be hidden variablesâonce we know the values of these variables, the apparent randomness disappears? In what follows we will present the mathematical theory in which true randomness is used. Later we will return to these questions. We will describe a clever experiment to distinguish between the hidden variable and the true randomness hypotheses. This experiment has been performed several times. The outcomes have always shown that the randomness is real and that there is no simple hidden variable theory that can eliminate it. We started this chapter by saying that a qubit can be represented by the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon. We will show how the models for spin and polarization are related. Photons and Polarization It is often said that we are not aware of the strange quantum phenomena because they only occur at incredibly small scales and are not apparent at the scales of our everyday life. There is some truth to this, but there is an experiment that is completely analogous to measuring spin of electrons that can be performed with very little apparatus. It concerns polarized light."

Why do our brains need to disconnect from the environment for hours every day? We discuss here the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), which proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity, to consolidate what we already learned, and be ready to learn new things the next day. In brief, new experiments show that the net strength of synapses increases with wake and decreases with sleep. As we discuss, these findings can explain why sleep is necessary for the well-being of neural cells and brain circuits, and how the regulation of synaptic strength may be a universal, essential function of sleep."

We have identified two main sources of this information. First source is information acquired from the user and second one is acquired by monitoring user's behavior while she is working with the application. Unfortunately, when the user starts using the application for the first time there is no information about her to provide successful personalization. When the personalization is not satisfactory for the user, it can deter the user from future using the application. We can look at this problem from two points of view â the new-system cold-start and the new-user cold-start problem (Middleton, 2003). The case of the new-system coldstart problem is related to the new system where is no initial information about any user. And the user who uses the application for the first time is the first user since the application has bean launched. In the other case the application has been running for a while and there are records about the other users who have already used this application. Asking the user questions seems to be a solution. But the user who is asked too many questions usually starts feeling bothered and inclines to check whatever answers just to get through it as fast as it gets.

By now weâve brought SMARTCONSTRUCTION to more than a thousand construction sites in Japan. If this pace continues, in the future there will be fewer machines and fewer workers in Japan than there are today. However, the productivity of the nation as a whole will increase. Komiyama By how much? Sakane For example, 3-D surveying with drones is overwhelmingly the most efficient method, starting with the fact that it requires fewer workers and fewer manhours than traditional 2-D surveying. Plus, the subcontracting structure that permeates the construction industry becomes irrelevant. When the internet of things arrives at the construction site, productivity goes up. The contractor and the job performer become one, which is most efficient. This changes the structure of the construction industry. It cuts right to the problem that every industry in Japan is facing, which is a war of attrition among a large number of players. By my lights, with 120 million people on our small islands, a labor shortage is something that doesnât make sense. The natural way is for someone retired from one business to go into some other business, but that sort of reform hasnât happened in Japan, and so we call it labor shortages. At Komatsu, we carried out a major structural reform, trimmed the workforce, pulled out from businesses where we canât try to be number one or two worldwide, and now we are moving forward with new business that strongly utilizes the internet of things.

No matter how much monetary easing there is from the government and the Bank of Japan, we canât overcome deflation unless the private sector takes an active role through those kinds of initiatives."
78,368,0.95,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"If action is indeed characterised as a beginning whose consequences can never be undone, scientific discoveries and technological developments are action by excellence, as they cannot be undone and correspond to new beginnings. Thinking about what happens to us and framing the challenges in a hyperconnected era is one of our generationâs tasks, and this ought to be done by balancing fears with confidence and control with wonder. Indeed, to reinforce and nurture the public space in a hyperconnected era, there is an urgent need to balance the omniscience-omnipotence utopia, pervaded by fear and control-seeking, with the plurality and natality perspectives, pervaded by confidence and wonder. This balancing generates a space where fears and risks are compensated by the confidence in beginnings, shared intelligence and practical wisdom. It generates a space where meanings are rooted in âin-betweensâ rather than in âthe more, the betterâ and where challenges are approached with âboth/andâ dualities rather than with âeither/orâ dilemmas. To some extent, it invites to shift away from the dominance of a risk governance approach to a literacy approach. Literacy is the set of skills, understood in a wide sense, which enables the experience of plurality. Hence, abilities to communicate are central to literacy understood in the wide sense. In a pre-digital context, literacy is about reading and writing, but it goes much beyond the technical ability and reaches out to the ability to understand, to contextualize and to be persuasive. For example, each of us learn very young and, most often, very painfully, the subtleties of communication. We all experienced the differences between what we want to say to our mother or to our best friend, or between what we want to say in confidence, and what we want to say loud and clear. When things go wrong, we learn and we adapt, and little by little, we acquire that extended literacy. Literacy is made of a mix of technical, social and ethical skills and considerations.

Belnapâs analysis of action in terms of ramified time has the merits of taking very seriously into consideration the temporal and causative order of the world. I follow his approach under many aspects. But I want to take into account the proper intentionality of agents that Belnap ignores. For that reason, agents carry out too many actions in his logic. Suppose that a proposition strictly implies another which is not then necessary. According to his analysis, an agent cannot make the first proposition true without also making the second true, even when the second proposition represents a fact that no agent could bring about or even try to bring about at that moment. Thus whoever repeats an action sees to it that he does that action and has done it in Belnapâs logic. Let me now repeat the principles of my approach.17 In my logic, intentional actions are primary as in philosophy. Some of our actions are involuntary. But any agent who performs unintentionally an action could in principle have attempted that action, and that unintentional action is generated by his or her intentional actions. The basic actions of agents are their primary attempts that are means to make all their other attempts; they generate all their other actions whether intentional or not. Agents know and intend few effects of their basic actions. A lot of their actions are then involuntary. However, not all unintended effects of intentional actions are involuntary actions, but only those that are historically contingent and that the agent could have attempted. In moving we inevitably agitate subatomic particles. Sometimes we are mistaken and we fail. Such events which happen in our life do not constitute actions. Indeed we could not move without agitating particles and our mistakes and failures could not be intentional.18 My logic of action contains a theory of attempt and of action generation. In my analysis, attempts are actions that agents make (rather than attitudes that they have). Attempts are actions of a very special kind: personal, conscious, intentional, free and successful. Only the agent can make his or her individual attempts. No one else can make them. Thus when two agents succeed in doing the same action (e.g. to drink) they do it thanks to different personal attempts (in that case different body movements). Attempts are intrinsically intentional actions. There are no involuntary attempts. When an agent makes an attempt, he or she makes that attempt in order to do something else. Attempts are means to achieve ends. Whoever attempts to make an attempt succeeds in making that attempt, but he or she can fail to reach his or her objective. An attempt is essentially a mental act. Whoever attempts to raise the arm can fail because of an external force. But he or she has anyway mentally made that attempt in forming consciously his or her present intention to raise the arm. Among intentional actions, attempts have then particular success conditions. It is enough to try to make an attempt in order to make it eo ipso. Direct attempts by an agent to move parts of oneâs body are real basic actions. When an agent forms the present intention to make a direct movement, an attempt is caused by the very formation of 17 See Vanderveken (2005b, 2008a). 18 Goldman (1970) notices that certain act properties like misspeaking, miscalculating, miscounting"

When we see our respondents in pain or afraid, especially when we come upon hard stories unexpectedly, the impact on us is much greater. This was the experience, for instance, of our Morocco researcher, who spent an afternoon meeting the members of an association for the rights of Salafist prisoners. She sat in a room full of women, the daughters, wives, and mothers of these prisoners. Each woman in turn told her story, and it was just one atrocity after the other. One ended her story about her son with âand they condemned him to the death penaltyâ. Another appeared to have become mentally deranged as the result of the killing of her younger child and husband, and possible psychological torture. Had she been working for an organization like Amnesty International, our researcher might have been prepared to hear these stories, and would have known what to do with them: write a report. But she was unprepared, and felt alone against the ugliest part of humankind. During the meeting, our researcher remained clinical, asking questions, taking notes. She could not open the door to empathy because it would have overwhelmed her. The traumatic impact of these stories was compounded by the intrusive surveillance, described above, that followed immediately afterward, and by the pressure to get results, which we discuss further on in this chapter. For a time, she could not stop thinking about the stories, the derangement of one woman, the lifeless voice of another. Hiking, eating well, and spending time on her own eventually helped her recover. Stories that unsettle us do not always come from those directly affected by them. Our Mexico researcher was shaken by the account of a forensic journalist who investigates crime scenes, including political murders. She told a story of careful planning and tremendous professionalism in the implementation of deliberately gruesome murders, intended to send a message to others. He was told similar stories by other respondents as well. Just like our Morocco researcher, his initial response was to get on with his work, ask more questions, analyze the situation, without considering the horror of what he had been told, and how it affected him personally. In fact, it is difficult to start processing the mental impact while in the field, when there are too many other things going on. We oftentimes need the safety of home, and the distance in time and space, to evaluate and deal with the impact the field has on us. If coping in the field becomes too hard, then going home early should be the obvious solution. However,"

In March 1940, his mother, Josephine Mary, wrote to Cardinal Joseph McRory pleading for his intervention. She steeped her letter with allegations of rampant immorality in convict prisons. Republican prisoners, she claimed, including a young seventeenyear-old, were imprisoned in Mountjoy alongside sexual degenerates, a tacit reference to the potential exposure of prisoners to homosexuality.57 Maud Gonne MacBride also wrote to McRory. As an active campaigner for improvement in Irish prison conditions, she framed her letter in terms of the cruelty of prison life and the harsh, demeaning rules in place that structured prison life. She claimed that ânon-recognition of political status leads to endless trouble, confusion and often to tragedy.â To fortify her point, she wrote: So we have men like Jack Plunkettâwhose family, God knows, have made sacrifices for Ireland which should have spared them this new tormentâon hunger strike for sixteen days and people wondering how long they will last â¦ none of these distressing things would have occurred if the prison code laid down recognition for political status.

Laurence Bonjour called considerations relating to the regress problem âperhaps the most crucial in the entire theory of knowledgeâ, and Robert Audi observes that no epistemologist quite knows how to handle the problem.1 The roots of the regress problem extend far back into epistemological history, and scholars often refer to the Greek philosopher Agrippa. Little is known about Agrippa, apart from the fact that he probably lived in the first century A.D. and might have been among the group of sceptics discussed by Sextus Empiricus, a philosopher and practising physician who allegedly flourished a century later. Sextusâ most famous work, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, contains an explanation and defence of what he takes to be the philosophy of another shadowy figure, namely Pyrrho of Elis (c. 365â270 B.C.), who himself wrote nothing, but became known for his sober life style and his aversion to academic or theoretical reasoning. So-called Pyrrhonian scepticism advocates the attainment of ataraxia, a state of serene calmness in which one is free from moods or other disturbances. An important technique for reaching this state is the practicing of argument strategies known as tropoi or modes, i.e. means to engender suspension of judgement by undermining any claim that conclusive knowledge or justification has been attained. For example, if it were claimed that a particular sound is known to be soft, a Pyrrhonian would point out that to a dog it is loud, and that we cannot judge the loudness or softness independently of the hearer. Typically, a Pyrrhonian will try to thoroughly acquaint himself with the modes, so that reacting in accordance with them becomes as it were a second nature. In this manner he will be able to routinely refrain from assenting to any weighty proposition q or Â¬q, and thus avoid getting caught up in one of those rigid intellectual positions that he loathes so much. In Book 1 of Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Sextus discusses five modes which he attributes to âthe more recent Scepticsâ (to be distinguished from what he calls âthe older Scepticsâ), and which Diogenes Laertius in the third century would identify with âAgrippa and his schoolâ.2 Of these five modes the 1 Bonjour 1985, p.18; Audi 1998, 183â184.

The total population of those municipalities which have already decided to participate in the Platinum Society Network has reached approximately 80 million. Since this is a considerable population, I hope such an attempt can start here. Of course, I do realize that it is a considerably far-fetched opinion, but is there any good alternative?

It is worth noting that they mention two Norwegian categories: âNorwegianâ and âethnic Norwegian.â They may experience themselves as âNorwegianâ in some social contexts, but never âethnic Norwegian.â In order to be labelled âethnic Norwegianâ they believe their parents and grandparents have to have been born in Norway, they must speak only Norwegian at home, and they should have fairer skin. They know they will not pass as ethnic Norwegians because of their physical appearance: dark hair and eyes, brownish skin. When it comes to boys, Koï¬ and David were also born and raised in Norway. Both of Koï¬âs parents are from the Ivory Coast. Davidâs mother is ethnic Norwegian, while his father is from Kenya. David had visited his relatives in Kenya three times during his lifetime. Yet he, like Koï¬ and the girls above, did not know what it is like to grow up outside Norway. Koï¬ said he views himself as from the Ivory Coast because his parents are from that country, while David said âI think of myself as Norwegian, although I feel that I am from another country and like to say I am from another country. I like to say that I am from Kenya. I am âhalf,â but some people think I am âwhole,â from another country; but most people think I am âhalf,â and when people ask I say I am âhalf.ââ David said he preferred to say he was from another country because he hung out with people who are not ethnic Norwegian. His choice of friends may also be because he looks âforeignâ with dark skin and African curly hair, like many of the others. In his everyday life he navigates and negotiates various cultural values by hanging out with peers having both non-Norwegian and ethnic Norwegian parents. However, an experience of belonging appears more connected to hanging out with children of immigrants. This may be because possible ethnic Norwegian friends are few in this area and children of immigrants look more similar to him. Again, the issue of skin colour appears relevant. The American psychologist Beverly Daniel Tatum, in her book Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria? (2003), argues that it is a necessary step in young peopleâs identity construction to hang out and seek belonging among those with the same racialized ethnic origin. David and other children in Dal appear to support Tatumâs claim of youth seeking belonging with others they deï¬ne as âsimilarâ regarding physical appearance and ethnic identity (Rysst 2014). As indicated in the case of the girls, the boysâ emphasis on non-Norwegian identity may be in part related to the fact that they have given up ever being called âNorwegianâ by others because of their appearance. As already mentioned, both Koï¬ and David are very dark-skinned. Previous research has illustrated the"

After all, as noted earlier, it is entirely unclear how we should count our beliefs. This observation already intimates that knock-down arguments whether we can or cannot have an infinite number of beliefs are not to be expected. Peter Klein has defended his infinitism against the finite minds objection by arguing that the objection is based on what he calls the âCompletion Requirementâ. According to this requirement, a belief can be justified for a person only if that person has actually completed the process of reasoning to the belief. Such a requirement, says Klein, is against the spirit of infinitism indeed, but it is also unrealistic in that it is too demanding: Of course, the infinitist cannot agree to [the Completion Requirement] because to do so would be tantamount to rejecting infinitism. More importantly, the infinitist should not agree because the Completion Argument demands more than what is required to have a justified belief.8"

Among all the comments we have had, two stand out as the most common. On a positive note, a large number of people commented on the importance of what we are doing, they described a world humanities report as timely and necessary, sometimes even as urgently needed. But there was another kind of reaction when our project was described as âvery ambitiousâ. After all, we were attempting to survey the state of the humanities worldwide and assess the challenges for the future. That itself is a challenge of almost bewildering proportions. We agree. Our project is as ambitious as it is worthwhile. But we make no apology, it had to be done, or it is at least one step in a longer-term process that has to be started. Many of the issues we address are already well-known (the value of the humanities, similarities to or differences from the sciences, interdisciplinarity, the digital humanities, funding and the relation between the humanities and society). But to come at them from a global perspective, comparing reports, commentaries and interviews from many countries brings an entirely new perspective to these well-worn issues. Furthermore, the very process of conducting the research â creating the contacts, building the goodwill, setting up a template for future research â might help build a worldwide platform for the humanities. So we see our effort, substantial as it has been, as a first step. Doubtless there are all sorts of ways in which future (or follow-up) reports can improve upon what we have done: more interviews, with different questions, covering a larger number of countries; the systematic collection of statistical data.

If the in-charges get invited and there is no money they will delegate. Surprisingly the in-charges have communication with the organisers of the workshops and they know how much they will get paid- one million shillings etc. â so in fact we should make all workshops so people come here and pick knowledge without getting any money â they come away only with knowledge not money. If you got back with that knowledge and maybe a meal but no money you will go back with that knowledge and want to implement it."

All these interventions would be based on the assumption that my preference not to plummet ought to be the other personâs preference as well. However, this is clearly not the case, since the observed person is choosing to step on the bridge. As Mill argues, the only mistake I may presume the person walking is making is that he is not correctly informed about the bridgeâs condition. If I have provided him with this information and he keeps on walking anyway, further attempts to prevent him from his course of action must be seen as unwarranted interventions into his individual freedom (Mill 1869, chapter 5, p. 5). The most fundamental way to express these characteristics and implications of the autonomy principle is to say that the autonomy principle does not include a conception of a shared or potentially sharable idea of a good life. Such an idea would justify attempts to understand and discuss reasons for acting one way rather than another. Interests could be understood as preliminary judgements on what ought to be regarded as good, which are then always open to revision. In contrast, following the autonomy principle, one may help others to fulfil their will if one is in a position to do so and if the other person asks for and needs help, regardless of how one assesses these aims oneself. The justification on which this option to help rests is that the end which the other person wants to realise is obviously in their interest and thus promotes what they regard as good for themselves. Conversely, if the person rejects an offer of help, such as a medical treatment, this is what they want, and no further attempts to change the will are called for. Attempts to alter what a person wants are confined to giving factual information. Doing more would have to be seen as unduly influencing the other personâs will, since there is no way to understand this exertion of influence as part of what the other person themselves would do or wants to do. Giving reasons for alternative courses of action becomes an unwarranted act of intrusion as soon as these reasons do not refer to the given interests and preferences of the other person. In other words, according to the autonomy principle, reasons for actions are solely the given interests of the acting person. Inter-individual reasons cannot be part of the individual process of will-formation."

In this chapter, I ï¬rst briefly discuss what I understand the term âprofessionalismâ to mean. It is not a topic I have ever studied and so I have attempted to set out my interpretation of how professionalism relates to workplace safety. I then discuss two areas where my own safety research has been located. These indicate two ways in which safety training and safety thinking can be integrated into routine work, at both operator and managerial levels. The ï¬rst is behavioural, namely to focus on the non-technical skills for a given job, as evidenced by the airlinesâ Crew Resource Management training and assessment programmes. This approach is now being adopted in other safety-critical sectors, such as acute medicine and offshore oil and gas operations, typical for operational staff but in some cases also for managers. The second direction is more attitudinal in nature: it examines the relatively novel concept of chronic unease, derived from the High Reliability Organisation literature. This has been used at both operational and managerial levels. What is proposed is that addressing both non-technical skills, as well as underlying attitudes to operational risks (chronic unease), can help to build protective skills for safety into the professional job repertoire."
139,129,0.95,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"We now turn our attention to solving mathematical problems through computer programming. There are many reasons to choose integration as our first application. Integration is well known already from high school mathematics. Most integrals are not tractable by pen and paper, and a computerized solution approach is both very much simpler and much more powerful â you can essentially treat all integrals a f .x/dx in 10 lines of computer code (!). Integration also demonstrates the difference between exact mathematics by pen and paper and numerical mathematics on a computer. The latter approaches the result of the former without any worries about rounding errors due to finite precision arithmetics in computers (in contrast to differentiation, where such errors prevent us from getting a result as accurate as we desire on the computer). Finally, integration is thought of as a somewhat difficult mathematical concept to grasp, and programming integration should greatly help with the understanding of what integration is and how it works. Not only shall we understand how to use the computer to integrate, but we shall also learn a series of good habits to ensure your computer work is of the highest scientific quality. In particular, we have a strong focus on how to write Matlab code that is free of programming mistakes. Calculating an integral is traditionally done by"
108,68,0.95,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"This holds some truth and certainly in the example of Yugoslavia. But society must present a social space, which allows those strategies to be used in a legitimate way. Furthermore, the actors must be structured so that they actually take the opportunity to use this space of possibilities which the structure of society present. In short, both the actors and society need a certain structure, otherwise, the violent scenario does not play out. This is the closest to a law we can come. If it was not for the play between society and actors then such a case as the one in Yugoslavia would play out more often than it does. Michael Mann is also preoccupied with the question of responsibility: If a few bad guys were responsible, how did they acquire such magical powers of coercion and manipulation? And were they quite so coherent in their planning; so in charge of events? After all, atrocities were committed by thousands of persons, and many more thousands stood around, either egging them on or doing nothing to stop them.9"

Such an approach to childrenâs development also makes clear that the concepts of functionings and capabilities, which are often clearly separated on a conceptual level, are in practice deeply entangled. Certain functionings have to be secured so that real choices can be made, and the situation of children illustrates this point further: as evolving agents, they rely on certain levels of health, education and social inclusion in exercising their choices â not only in terms of accessible opportunities but of actually realized functionings. Thus, for many social evaluations, it is reasonable to make functionings the most important category of analysis, especially when children are the target group. In the next chapter, we will also show that a focus on choice and freedom is often not the best way to scrutinize and evaluate the injustice of child poverty. Without downplaying their competencies, skills and agency, in many contexts it is basic to look at what has been effectively achieved and not at the options that are available to them. It matters, for instance, that children are in fact well nourished, not that they are capable of being so. A few provisos are necessary: Firstly, we do not claim that this list is finished. It is open for discussion and further scrutiny, and other researchers using different methods or working on questions in a different context will produce slightly different lists. Secondly, the similarities to the lists of Nussbaum and Robeyns suggest, as we have stated before, that some functionings and capabilities are important for both children and adults. Thirdly, this list is still very vague and needs to be further specified in order to be able to be applied in different contexts. Nonetheless, it is a start, and we will use this list, more specifically some of the functionings and capabilities on it, to further examine the injustice of child poverty in the next chapter in more detail. We position ourselves therefore with a rather pragmatic approach within the mentioned discussions about adequate lists for theorizing justice. We do not aim for completeness; nevertheless, we are confident that on this basis we will be able to build a strong case that child poverty profoundly violates what social justice demands. Before we can do that, however, we have to discuss the issue of the rule or principle of justice we want to endorse."

AIC drops insignificant independent variables to better estimate the impact of analysis options. The R2 values for the models are good, with the lowest of any model being 0.71. After performing the regression, we examine the results to discover potential trends. Then we draw plots to examine how those trends manifest in the different programs. This lets us study the whole distribution, including outliers and any non-linear behavior, in a way that would be difficult if we just looked at the regression model. At the same time, if we only looked at plots it would be hard to see general trends because there is so much data. Threats to Validity. There are several potential threats to the validity of our study. First, the benchmark programs may not be representative of programs that analysis users are interested in. That said, the programs were drawn from a well-studied benchmark suite, so they should provide useful insights. Second, the insights drawn from the results of the array index out-of-bound analysis may not reflect the trends of other analysis clients. We note that array bounds checking is a standard, widely used analysis. Third, we examined a design space of 162 analysis configurations, but there are other design choices we did not explore. Thus, there may be other independent variables that have important effects. In addition, there may be limitations specific to our implementation, e.g., due to precisely how WALA implements points-to analysis. Even so, we relied on time-tested implementations as much as possible, and arrived at our choices of analysis features by studying the literature and conversing with experts. Thus, we believe our study has value even if further variables are worth studying. Fourth, for our experiments we ran each analysis configuration three times, and thus performance variation may not be fully accounted for. While more trials would add greater statistical assurance, each trial takes about a week to run on our benchmark machines, and we observed no variation in precision across the trials. We did observe variations in performance, but they were small and did not affect the broader trends. In more detail, we computed the variance of the running time among a set of three runs of a configuration as (max-min)/median to calculate the variance. The average variance across all configurations is only 4.2%. The maximum total time difference (max-min) is 32 min, an outlier from eclipse. All the other time differences are within 4 min."

We use the total sample as a platform for overall comparison and provide background material and quotations, and figures to improve understanding of this diversity. In addition, Fig. 15.1 provides an illustration of interindividual differences in mobility as people age. In comparison with changes in satisfaction of the total sample, the changes in satisfaction of Mr. Lechner (80 years old) and Mrs. Dahlmann (87 years old) mirror characteristic developments over the 10-year interval (Fig. 15.1, panel a). Mr. Lechnerâs satisfaction with his out-of-home mobility options had decreased between the years 1995 (M = 10.0) and 2000 (M = 9.0) because of a severe illness. He recovered between the second and the third assessment and was happy about his new freedom: âThanks to my recovery it is possible to put more strain on my body, and I make the most of it for trips, hiking, and long-distance trips.â Together with his wife he walks at least five to six kilometers every day and does all his shopping and errands on foot or by public transport because they have no car available. He is still able to actively pursue his hobbiesâcooking, painting, and forming wood and other materialsâand because he experiences no impairments he said, âHence, I can be quite satisfiedâ (M = 9.0). The course that Mrs. Dahlmannâs satisfaction took was quite different. Her mobility-related satisfaction had increased between 1995 (M = 7.0) and 2000 (M = 9.00). However, she suffered from late effects of a cancer surgery and had to undergo operations on her veins and hip joint between the second and third assessment. Because the latter surgery was not completely successful, her mobility is severely restricted. She can still reach shops and services in the neighborhood on foot. However, longer trips are no longer possible: She gave up driving and is not yet accustomed to using public transport. Inside activities are only a little limitedâof course, my range is not large and that makes a big difference. But outdoor mobility and out-of-home activities are restricted....Actually, because of pain I walk with the aid of a cane anyway, and I feel extremely unsure as a result....The movability of my feet has decreased, and when I step down a curb or something similar I have to pay careful attention....In the past I loved hiking, even in high mountain areasâbut this is no longer possible. My activities are limited to what I have to do: shopping and what is necessary for daily living."
259,48,0.949,The Little Book of Semaphores,"Since mutex is initially 1, whichever thread gets to the wait first will be able to proceed immediately. Of course, the act of waiting on the semaphore has the effect of decrementing it, so the second thread to arrive will have to wait until the first signals. I have indented the update operation to show that it is contained within the mutex. In this example, both threads are running the same code. This is sometimes called a symmetric solution. If the threads have to run different code, the solution is asymmetric. Symmetric solutions are often easier to generalize. In this case, the mutex solution can handle any number of concurrent threads without modification. As long as every thread waits before performing an update and signals after, then no two threads will access count concurrently. Often the code that needs to be protected is called the critical section, I suppose because it is critically important to prevent concurrent access. In the tradition of computer science and mixed metaphors, there are several other ways people sometimes talk about mutexes. In the metaphor we have been using so far, the mutex is a token that is passed from one thread to another. In an alternative metaphor, we think of the critical section as a room, and only one thread is allowed to be in the room at a time. In this metaphor, mutexes are called locks, and a thread is said to lock the mutex before entering and unlock it while exiting. Occasionally, though, people mix the metaphors and talk about âgettingâ or âreleasingâ a lock, which doesnât make much sense. Both metaphors are potentially useful and potentially misleading. As you work on the next problem, try out both ways of thinking and see which one leads you to a solution."

They are moose hunting, playing golf, or repairing the house depending on what country you are in. Usually this is just phantasy, studies reveal no such trend though doubtlessly examples can be found. Some of the fathers that I interviewed had worked part-time during their parental leave but so had some of the mothers. Usually this was in order to be able to extend the leave period so that they either worked while the child slept during the day or in the evening when the partner was at home. But generally the fathers just did what mothers and housewives have done, they took care of the child or children and they did the domestic chores. One of the fathers [10] described it thus: When I was at home with her I took completely care of the home, I did the laundry, cleaned up, vacuumed and scrubbed and dusted and tried to have the home nice looking when she came home."
308,215,0.949,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Beneï¬cence connotes acts of mercy, kindness, and charity. It includes all forms of action intended to beneï¬t or promote the good of other persons. The principle of beneï¬cence refers to a normative statement of moral obligation to act for the beneï¬t of others, helping them to further important legitimate interests, often by preventing or removing possible harms. As we have mentioned in the previous chapter on nonmaleï¬cence both are interconnected. Preventing harm and removing harm (or evil) are both considered a type of beneï¬cence. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ordered his companions to do charity daily. They said: Who can do that? He said: Removing a thorny bush, or bones or dirt from the way (street) is a charity; showing the right path for those lost is a charity, enjoining right and forbidding wrong is a charity; helping those who are inefï¬cient in their work is a charity.â One of the companions said, âWhat if I didnât do any of these?â He said, âAt least do no harm to others.â Narrated by AlBokhari, Muslim and Ibn Hibban [1]. Doing Harm and Reciprocating Harm is Not Allowed [2]. The Qurâan and the Tradition are full of passages and sayings of the Prophet enjoining good and refraining from doing harm. We will quote here a few ayas of the Qurâan: (1) Have you seen the one who denies the religion (hereafter)? That is the one who drives away harshly the orphan. And does not encourage the feeding of the poor. So woe to those who pray, (but) who are heedless of their prayers. Those who made show of their deeds and withheld their assistance to their neighbors (Holy Qurâan 107/1-7). (2) Woe to every scorner and mocker. Who collects wealth and (continuously) counts it. He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal. No. He will surely be thrown into the crusher (Hellï¬re which crushes their bones) (Holy Qurâan 104/1-4). (3) Whoever does an atomâs weight of good will see it and, whoever does an atomâs weight of evil will see it (Holy Qurâan 99/7, 8). (4) And they were not commanded except to worship Allah; (being) sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and give zakat (obligatory alms giving) and that is the correct religion (Holy Qurâan 98/5). (5) Did he not ï¬nd you (O Muhammad) an orphan and gave you refuge? And He found you poor and made (you) self-sufï¬cient. So for the orphan do not oppress him and for the petitioner do not repel him (Holy Qurâan 93/6-10). (6) And the righteous one will avoid it (hellï¬re).

46,64,0.949,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"are definitely many valuable but noncommensurable options as to how to live oneâs life as an adult, maximizing well-becoming is probably not even a coherent idea. We see, therefore, that questions concerning the well-being and well-becoming of children are deeply entangled with general considerations about the good life. And since we agree with the diagnosis of political liberalism that there is no objective way to fully determine the nature of the good life (Nussbaum 2001; Rawls 2005), we also reject the mentioned ideas about maximization. On the other hand, we are always concerned with context-sensitive thresholds that are specified according to the living standards in that society. This reflects partly what is possible in a state but targets a different issue; namely, that it is important for justice for children that children do not fall behind for arbitrary reasons and that determining the adequate threshold by looking at the level that typically is achieved in that society is essential. For example, if most children in a society are able to acquire a certain level of knowledge and if that knowledge is used for further education or in the job market, it is reasonable and feasible to demand that all children be brought up to that level. This does not imply that each and every child should become a scientist but that each and every child should finish primary and secondary school and that all children that do so should be on more or less the same level. Finally, justice for children in modern welfare states always has a forward-looking perspective. As technology and livings standards grow and as we gain more knowledge on childrenâs lives and health, we naturally can provide for them better; as a consequence, demands of justice also improve. In a historical perspective, this is quite obvious: the standards of justice for children 150 years ago were different; we did not know about many illnesses or about how they were transmitted and cured and we were still at the beginning of building public infrastructure like railroads, electricity and clean water in all places. Hence it was simply not possible to have all children grow up and live under the conditions we can easily secure for them nowadays and are seen as ânormalâ today. Of course, the requirements for participating as an equal in the society one is part of have changed considerably, too. The knowledge and education needed for practicing full citizenship in a modern society today is different from what was necessary fifty or sixty years ago. And since this feature of political participation is usually given much weight by capability theorists (Anderson 2010; Nussbaum 2006; Sen 2009), the relevant thresholds have to be adapted accordingly.

For our purposes, the important fact is that the energy levels of the Cooper pairs in a superconducting loop that contains a Josephson junction are discrete and can be used to encode qubits. IBM uses superconducting qubits in its quantum computers. In 2016, IBM introduced a five-qubit processor that they have made available to everyone for free on the cloud. Anyone can design their own quantum circuit, as long as it uses five or fewer qubits, and run it on this computer. IBMâs aim is to introduce quantum computing to a wide audienceâcircuits for superdense coding, for Bellâs inequality, and a model of the hydrogen atom have all been run on this machine. A primitive version of Battleships has also been run, giving the coder the claim of constructing the first quantum computer multiplayer game. At the end of 2017, IBM connected a twenty-qubit computer to the cloud. This time it is not for education, but it is a commercial venture where companies can buy access. Google is working on its quantum computer. It also uses superconducting qubits. Google is expected to announce in the near future that it has a computer that uses 72 qubits. What is special about this number? Classical computers can simulate quantum computers if the quantum computer doesnât have too many qubits, but as the number of qubits increases we reach the point where that is no longer possible. Google is expected to announce that it has reached or exceeded this number, giving them the right to claim quantum supremacyâthe first time an algorithm has been run on a quantum computer that is impossible to run, or simulate, on a classical computer. IBM, however, is not giving up without a fight. Its team, using some innovative ideas, has recently found a way to simulate a 56-qubit system classically, increasing the lower bound on the number of qubits needed for quantum supremacy. As work continues on building quantum computers, we are likely to see spinoffs into other areas. Qubits, however we encode them, are sensitive to interactions with their surroundings. As we understand these interactions better we will be able to build better shields to protect our qubits, but we will also be able to design ways our qubits can measure their surroundings. ** Brian David Josephson received the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on how Cooper pairs can flow through a Josephson junction by quantum tunneling."

Thorny as the issue may be, the meaning of âjustificationâ cannot be set aside if we want to examine whether chains of justification must be finite or can be infinite. Klein is right that there exist many different accounts of epistemic justification, but it is not so that all these accounts can be used without problem. Some of the accounts will be useful to infinitists, while others might be more advantageous to foundationalists or coherentists. It is therefore important to have an account of justification, however provisional it may be, on which everybody agrees, and then see whether this account allows infinite justificatory chains â and if so, in what sense. William Alston has argued that such a neutral account of justification is impossible.25 In his view, no definition of justification can serve as an impartial starting point or as a tool for adjudicating epistemological debates. Every definition will eventually take sides, and favour a particular position in the epistemological debate about the structure of justfication. Alstonâs advice to the epistemological community therefore is to abstain from attempts at defining justification and instead turn to spelling out what he calls âepistemic desiderataâ. That will be more fruitful for the theory of knowledge than undertaking ill-fated attempts to find a definition of justification. Alstonâs point is well taken, but we think it applies primarily to material accounts of justification, less so to formal ones. As we will argue in Chapter 2, focusing on the formal properties of epistemic justification might generate more consensus than Alston deems possible. Moreover, as we will show in Chapters 3 to 6, a focus on formal properties casts doubt on several objections to the idea that justificatory chains can be infinitely long. In the end, our formal explication of justification provides us with means to preserve many, although not all, of Peter Kleinâs intuitions about the value of infinitism."

The first byte is read from memory into the accumulator with the MOV instruction, and then subsequent ADD instructions add the other 4 bytes to the accumulator. After each byte is read from memory, the value in the HL register pair is incremented with the INX instruction. Finally, the STA instruction stores the result in memory. How would this program be enhanced to add a hundred or a thousand bytes together? Would you just keep adding INX and ADD instructions to match the number of bytes you need to add? That doesnât seem quite right. Itâs not a solution that would work well with other needs. Itâs not a generalized solution. What might instead be handy is a new instruction that allows repeating certain sequences of instructions, in this case the INX and ADD instructions. But what would that look like?

However, because interpretations of what constituted a start-up suitable for investments differed between the hub staff and the investors, the investors incurred additional costs by spending time and resources on start-ups that did not meet their criteria. An investor explained: The teams that were recommended by [an innovation hub], we look at their pitch deck and itâs so bad.

206,218,0.949,a History of Radionuclide Studies in The UK : 50Th Anniversary of The British Nuclear Medicine Society,"CT brain scanning had been around since 1971. I did what were then called House Physician and Surgeon jobs at the West Middlesex Hospital in West London and I remember well the CT scanner (the first in the world) at the nearby Atkinson Morley Hospital. Quickly everyone realised the potential in diagnosis for brain diseases (not too surprising when one considers that it replaced such invasive procedures as air encephalography) and within a few years the role of CT brain scanning was established. I later looked at the early history of Xrays for an exhibition at Guyâs and was struck by the similarity between the rapid rate of adoption of Xrays (Roentgenograms in those days but changed in the First World War to Xrays and Roentgengraphy changed to Radiology). But I digress. CT brain scanning eventually replaced radionuclide blood-brain barrier scanning. In those days the resolution of everything was too poor for imaging techniques to be used for dementia. There was also the growing development of ultrasound which was to replace liver scanning, again used mainly for detecting metastases. So up went the cry that Nuclear Medicine had no future. Well, along came thallium cardiac imaging. I remember in around 1985 comparing workloads over the decade and the number of studies performed had increased, despite losing all the liver and brain scans, largely as a result of the cardiac work. In addition as an indicator of what was to come, the complexity of studies was increasing. With this came a small but useful technological advance, what were called âlargeâ field of view cameras. Now routine, but what it meant is it was now possible to image the whole of the chest and get in the shoulders in one image. This resulted in images which referring clinicians found easier to interpret â those of you who are still following my gist will see a trend here. Those of you who are not â well never mind! Then along came whole body CT. (The first scanner was made by EMI and was thus called an Emiscan, then when other manufacturers entered the fray they were called CAT scans and at later date this was shortened to CT â why? I donât know). Whole body CT imaging developed in the late 80âs and St Thomasâ had, I believe, the second whole body EMI scanner. Again people worried that Nuclear Medicine had no future. In contrast to the CT brain scanner the use of whole body CT took some time to establish itself. I think this is because it was slow and the images were degraded by movement artefacts. Of course the first demonstration of Computerised Tomography by Oldendorf in 1961 was using isotopes and it was not developed further because the rest of technology for imaging was not ready. (Another digression, if we were to go back to 1890 and asked what do we want to develop, a functional imaging methodology for the body or âshadowâ images, which would we choose? It was only the ease with which Xray apparatus could be made and the lack of such technology that resulted in Roentgenography taking on the leading role in imaging). Then along came SPECT. (I always wondered why do we have SPECT but not TCT or PECT?) SPECT was a bit a a game changer in cardiac studies since one now had the heart imaged in a way the cardiologists could understand and the result was a huge expansion in our cardiac workload to the point that full list cardiac studies were being performed 3â4 days per week, as opposed to one small list every 2 weeks. SPECT cardiac studies took off despite there being little evidence that they"

But the objective of this chapter is not to solve the (unsolvable?) replication problem (apparently more challenging even in social psychology than in science in general) about which so many books and papers have already been written. The question rather is what a dialectical-psychoanalytical view can contribute to our understanding of Stapelâs misconduct in response to the challenges emerging in his âimpossible professionâ. Was his misconduct perhaps a (misguided) response to the replication crisis and other embarrassing problems occurring in this type of university discourse? There may be more continuity between âfabricationâ (in the non-normative sense) of social psychological facts âbackstageâ, and the âfabricationâ (now in a pejorative sense) of fraudulent data published in Stapelâs papers than the committees (in their persistent use of metaphors such as âcleansing operationâ) seem able or willing to acknowledge. What I find remarkable is that the three committees, while claiming to have âscrutinizedâ a whole body of work, fail to address the methodological discussions that are part of this work (discussions which increasingly reflect a sense of despair on the part of the author). As if âscrutinizingâ an oeuvre means something else than reading and addressing its content, but I will return to this issue below. Interestingly, Stapelâs fraud has been regarded as an experiment in itself. Question: how often and to what extent can an established scientist commit fraud before it is detected? Abma cites a colleague who argued that we should seriously consider the possibility that Stapelâs fraud is actually a research trial, involving his peers and colleagues as research subjects, and that we should not be surprised if he (Stapel) at a certain point decides to publish an analysis of his results (2013, p. 157). What is pointed out here is that the technique of deception of research subjects (which is accepted practice in social psychology) is applied by Stapel to the research community as such. What is the crucial normative difference between these two instances of deception?"
117,285,0.949,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Witnessing as a Reassuring Being-With Most women undergo a feeling of uncertainty during pregnancy, birth and the postpartum stage, even if it is not the first time they are experiencing it. One main aim of the attendance by a midwife is to reassure the woman by ânormalizingâ her experiences. The feminine body is subject to significant changes. The usually absent body can become a dys-appearing body: it manifests itself as a difficult or disharmonious body. A problematic interpretation could be that life phases in which this usually happens are identified as being dysfunctional or alienating themselves (Leder 1990). Eli had an appointment with the midwife in the early morning. She arrived crimson red and snorting, obviously suffering from her enormously big womb. The expected delivery date had been three days ago. âIâm in such a bad moodâ. Eli sat down straddle-legged, face-to-face to the midwife who looked at her attentively. Eli had given several false alarms because she had thought the baby would come. âI canât sleep, I have cramps and my back hurts. I have been ill for nine months. It has to come nowâ. The midwife says that she understands her and then asks when Eli wants her child to come. âTomorrowâ. she answers. âWhat time?â âIn the morningâ. This would be doable with her schedule, too, the midwife says and Eli leaves apparently relieved."

Although the debate about whether to accept grant funding or venture capital funding is very much alive among entrepreneurs in Kenya, it focuses on a small piece of the puzzle. Entrepreneurs should consider very carefully the choices they make about not just their revenue model, but also the myriad other aspects of organizational culture that they adopt. When designing the structure of a new company, what templates are being used to influence it? Incubators? Peer competitors? Successful foreign companies?

People seemed to believe that major cases of corruption within the communal councils decreased after the first few years of their functioning, though rumors of âcutsâ here and there were always widespread. But as Lazar (2008) also notes for community organizations in Bolivia, âminor compensationsâ are often socially accepted as long as they are not too much. Members of the community recognized that voceros couldnât work for free, but the ambiguities of what constituted corruption or not, and the ethos of voluntary work inscribed in the formal design of the communal councils, made it a contentious topic as to where the compensation should be drawn from and how much. For example, once I visited a communal council that was in the process of constructing and rehabilitating several houses in its community. I had traveled with Gerardo, a promotor integral from Fundacomunal, up to the highest hills of La Silsa, next to 23 de Enero. We spent the morning visiting the different houses and talking with the workers and the house owners before we went to the home of the leader of the communal bank in order to fill out the necessary paperwork that Gerardo needed for bureaucratic purposes in Fundacomunal. On the metro ride back home, Gerardo confided that when the housing project was first launched, the ladies in the communal bank had tried to do some âcreative accountingâ and that he went down hard on them. He had told the leader of the communal bank that she could not play around with the invoices, âbecause you are the one that will pay for itâ (if it gets detected) but that everyone recognized that she worked for free, and that, for that reason, she should rather cut a deal with the workers to get a share. I asked if that was common and he answered that, yes, it was, âbut I wouldnât know how.â This episode illustrates how gray areas of the law and folk perception of fairness to some extent interfered with how corruption was socially evaluated in the communal councils."

It is also so culturally rich and subtle that numerous interpretations can be drawn from it. However, I wanted to quote him here because he manages to indicate the deep-seated and complex template of viveza, or what is called la viveza criolla in several Latin American countries, or in the case of Brazil, jeitinho. The concept denotes a form of cunningness and calculated astuteness that forms part of the Latin American imagery of collective personhoods and social arrangements. âFirst we invent the trampa (the trick, trap) and then the law, with enough cracks to allow us to go through with la trampa,â said Ezequiel MartÃ­nez Estrada, Argentinian intellectual and author (La Nueva 2010, authorâs translation from Spanish). It describes the socialization of an individualized and shameless anything-goes behavior, whereby only a fool obeys the rules. In Venezuela, the concept encapsulates everything from corruption to shady or semi-legal rebusques (inventive ways of making quick money or earn an extra income), jumping ahead in the bus line, pushing oneâs way through by force in a traffic jam, refusing to offer prioritized seating to elderly and pregnant people on the metro, a general lack of respect for others and any kind of self-seeking behavior. It could also be used to denounce politicians or career climbers, or anyone who seek to get ahead through cunningness and foul play. In colloquial speech it is often used when someone tries to be clever or trick themselves out of (or into) something, as in no seas vivo/a (donât be inventive/donât be mischievous). While it is commonly referred to as a negative trait, it is also at times ambiguously interpreted as a positive trait symbolizing the ability to survive in a difficult environment, a âtalent for life,â and, to a certain extent, social success. Sometimes, you would hear people practically boast about their capacity to enrich themselves through petty corruption or favorable rebusques. Among some, it seemed to be considered a sign of masculinity."

Our Malaysia researcher used it when interviewing people about their decision-making as to whether to join a demonstration. We find the default option of anonymity appropriate in these cases for three reasons. First, as âordinary citizensâ, these people have typically not chosen to be professionally engaged with politics, they are usually not accustomed to being interviewed and cited, and they thus deserve a high level of protection of their privacy. Secondly, while some respondents might simply refuse to speak to us if we were to cite them by name, others might well agree to be interviewed, but we believe that the validity of their answers to our questions might suffer if they knew they could be quoted by name. This is an issue that is not unique to authoritarianism research, it would apply to interviews with vulnerable groups (i.e. victims of sexual abuse, undocumented migrants, or drug users) in democratic societies as well. In an authoritarian context, all ordinary citizens are in the âvulnerableâ category when we ask them questions that relate to their views of their government or dissident behavior. This is not to suggest that they would be in immediate fear of arrest or worse.

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"In summary, then, the cost of care back home and the impossibility of being reimbursed for oneâs health expenses when away from France are two major motivations for doing the va-et-vient. A third motivation stems from residentsâ concerns over the quality of treatment for chronic, non-emergency care back home, and the availability of medicines. Nonetheless, this raises a key question: what are the impacts on health of the vaet-vient itself? Can it be considered a sound healthcare strategy? I asked this of all the healthcare professionals I interviewed, and opinions were mixed. Conflicting messages also emerge from the literature on the subject. A minority answered in the affirmative: âThe regular return trip is the best way to care for oneself.â (Barou 2007: 1; authorâs translation). Similarly, in response to my question whether the vaet-vient could be considered as a healthcare strategy, BÃ©atrice (health advisor, migrant welfare association), answered: Yes [emphatic], for two reasons. Some treatments cost less back home. Teeth and glasses. That costs a lot here, it costs much less back home. So they go home for these treatments. There's also the fact that they need to return home, to see the country, to see their wife, to see the children and grandchildren â that helps their morale.

It is unclear what individual differences account for as regards the finding that some students are able to achieve way beyond their apparent capacities in schools where the language of instruction is different from their home languages. These are the resilient students, and some believe resilience can be taught (Roesingh, 2004).

They found the Title I studentsâ scores higher. Very few datasets had as many variables as the Carter âSustaining Effectsâ data, so it is not known in most studies of achievement gaps who had been in Title I; all that is known is studentsâ NAEP scores and their raceethnicity, sex, and an indicator of family income (free lunch, partial free lunch, no free lunch) (Carter 1984). By the 1990s there was much debate and publicity about achievement gaps, almost all of it around race-ethnicity. These debates were spurred by episodes of academic racism regarding race and IQ. As a result, the focus in Title I studies switched from family income to studentsâ race-ethnicity. In 1999, Maris Vinovskis reviewed the history of Title I. Vinovskis is a demographic historian and frequent consultant on both sides of the aisle, focusing on federal program effectiveness. With regard to Title I, Vinovskis judged that âefforts to radically change its approach or focus were ignored or defeated in the early 1980s.â A Congressionally managed study called âProspectsâ followed three cohorts over six years and concluded that Title I âdid not appear to help at-risk students in high-poverty schools to close their academic achievement gaps with students in low-poverty schools.â Like the Carter study, the Congressional âProspectsâ data included whether students were in Title I or not. The authors reported that (in Vinovskisâ words) Title I was âinsufficient to close the gap in academic achievement between advantaged and disadvantaged studentsâ (Vinovskis 1999a). I lack the expertise and the space here to evaluate the âProspectsâ work. I note, however, that âeliminatingâ the achievement gap is a high hurdle. If disadvantaged students were not totally closing the gap between their scores and those of advantaged students, they might nonetheless have been keeping it from widening, and Title I might have been a factor. But gaps according to income, though they were not as emphasized, were flat or widening in recent decades, while those between race-ethnic groups were decreasing.

116,26,0.949,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Kant does not claim that we should not use other people as means, and would accept that we pay someone to sweep our floor or bring a parcel to the other side of town. What he considers morally forbidden is to use someone solely as means to an end, where the ways we involve them put hindrances on their opportunities to live a meaningful life. A slave-owner uses the slaves as merely as means to an end. If Ben tells lies to get rid of the difficult employee, he is using the other person merely as means to achieve his own goal of creating a more harmonious workplace. A utilitarian can argue that torture and other horrible acts under some circumstances are not only morally permissible, but also morally required, since they maximize utility. From a duty ethics perspective, conclusions like that expose the absurdity of the utilitarian outlook. The response from utilitarianism is to criticize duty ethics for providing too much moral protection to individuals, generating passivity in situations where lives can be saved, and societies protected. Utilitarianism embraces the concept of dirty hands, or the idea that it is sometimes morally acceptable to perform actions that in and of themselves are horrible, in the name of the greater good for all those affected. Moral reasoning and justification in organizations can show traces of utilitarianism and duty ethics, even when the protagonists have limited knowledge of the two traditions. Ethical theories tend to capture different kinds of moral intuitions and gut feelings about how one should act under given circumstances. We can explore the issue further in the light of a fictitious story developed on the basis of remarks from the British philosopher Philippa Foot (1967, pp. 8â9). It is the famous trolley problem: DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0005"

Only after feedback from the leader at the unit did he realize that the normal and expected behavior from newcomers was to seek assistance and be open about oneâs own shortcomings. Opportunities for further work at the hospital would have been greater if he had actively sought help from more experienced and competent colleagues. In the fictitious case of the doctor who refrained from asking more experienced colleagues for help, we can imagine a similar set of reasons why he might have wanted to sort out complications with the patient on his own. He, too, is in a position where he wants to make a good impression and demonstrate that he can cope with complex cases on his own. All three dimensions of social cost are relevant to understand why someone in his position may avoid seeking help, even when the life of a child patient is at stake. Gender differences can affect the threshold for seeking help. In a study conducted at a hospital, Lee (2002) followed the introduction of a new medication-ordering system, introduced in place of a system based on hand-written paper forms, and looked at how often people sought help from various sources when they encountered problems with the new system. She found that women were significantly more likely than men to seek help in such situations. That even held when comparing male and female doctors. Lee interprets these findings to mean that being competent, superior, and independent may be more important to male self-esteem than to female self-esteem. Gilligan (1982) proposed that women are socialized to value relational closeness and interdependence, while men to a stronger degree value independence and being able to look after oneself. There appears to be a gender difference when it comes to help seeking, and it can be important to acknowledge that, regardless of whether we consider that the causes are biological or social. Another interesting finding in Leeâs study is that tasks central to an organizationâs core competence, the ones that directly influence the organizationâs strategic advantage and competitiveness, are precisely the tasks for which the organizational members perceive the social cost of seeking help to be the highest. It appears to be harder and more socially costly, then, to seek help to perform tasks that people in the organization"

Thatâs because a variety of organizations were also applying pressure along with that coming from governments. Komiyama I was saying they definitely would make an agreement. That is to say, CO2 emissions from the worldâs two biggest emitters, the United States and China, have already started to fall. These two countries were positive. Uchiyamada The volume of Japanâs CO2 emissions is about 4% of the worldâs total. Even if Japan reached zero, the worldâs level wouldnât get that much better. As you say, the important thing is for countries like China and the United States, which are major emitters to participate in a global framework and worked toward reducing emissions. In that context, I think the question is what can an advanced country in the area of environmental technology like Japan do to help."

During my field interviews, I often asked middle-aged or elderly people what they thought about oil during the Puntofijo era. To my surprise at first, almost everyone responded that they didnât think about it, or that they didnât know much about it. However, it soon dawned on me that this professed lack of consciousness about oil to a large extent was a reflection of the schism between âthe two Venezuelasâ: that of the middle and upper classes imagining themselves in the core of and benefiting from the oil state, and that of the popular sectors who had no means to partake in the symbolic and material manifestations of its riches. As one elderly woman said: âoil didnât concern us, oil was for the oil people.â If we remember Coronilâs words about the little that we know about how subaltern lives were lived in the shadows of the Magical State, it is my belief, through numerous conversations, that people were above all concerned with mitigating lifeâs innumerable challenges in their immediate life worlds. However, that does not mean that the grandiose imagery of the Magical State that he describes was not present though the everpresent promises and political spectacles that the poor were also exposed to. Indeed, as Ewell indicates (Ewell 1984:193) and as we will address more in depth later on, Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rezâs golden period in the 1970s in particular conjured an imagery of prosperity being just around the corner, also for the poor. However, in spite of these expectations and the Venezuelan stateâs dazzling spectacles, peopleâs tangible experiences with the state were above all characterized by marginalization and oppression. While some experienced a growing frustration leading to an enormous anger with the whole system (as evidenced by the frequent protests during the 1980s and 1990s), others again described themselves as apathic during these years. They had no interest in or concern for politics. It belonged to the realm of âthe others.â However, historical memory is a malleable imaginative horizon. As Schwartz notes, âthe way ordinary people conceive the past, reflects the concerns of the presentâ (Schwartz 1997:470, cited in Auyero 2001:183). And I believe that we can safely assume that knowledge about oil was present at some level for most people, even if they felt that it didnât concern them. However, if we do contend that our focus in the present shapes our memories of the past, it follows that ChÃ¡vezâs promise to redistribute oil gave new meaning to their memories of the Fourth Republic. It was through ChÃ¡vezâs political message that many people internalized that"

The role of sundhed.dk was to engage and, at the same time, control the partners. This was considered a ââ¦difficult balancing act for sundhed.dkâ to get the regions and municipalities to engage and own the process while at the same time manage and coordinate the efforts (representative, the regions). Building on the installed base of a core set of actors was in this case a doubleedged sword, as one of the informants also stated; âWhat is their [sundhed.dk] strength is also their weaknessâ (representative, SSI). The informant here is referring to the broad alliance of partners, which gave the organization and e-health portal legitimacy, but also made it heavy and inflexible in the sense that many considerations were required for every decision. For example, the prioritization of tasks was described as a politicized decision-making process: âIt is very difficult to be sundhed.dk in terms of serving so many mastersâ (representative, Ministry of Health). The head of administration in sundhed.dk further elaborated on the challenges in decision-making and prioritization processes: âWe cannot prioritize projects ourselves [internally in sundhed.dk]. We need to do that in collaboration with our partners. They have their own interests and local benchmarks and we donât have resources to financially support all their wishesâ. This situation put sundhed. dk in a certain bind. In addition, priorities seemed to shift after certain tasks had been initiated, thus making the daily development of new services cumbersome: âYou can risk that when the economical agreements are made, a politician will suddenly say âNow we need more people to donate their organs, so in 2013 this should be registered on sundhed.dkâ. This was not how it was earlier â we knew very well what we needed to do. Now our partners often want to lift their IT-strategies and projects via the portalâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). Although it complicates development when having to accommodate all partnersâ needs and IT strategies, it is encouraged and part of sundhed.dkâs overall mission. Overall, there has been broad support from relevant players in the Danish healthcare arena, but at the same time, it has been challenging for the sundhed.dk organization to serve so many masters. As time passed, the majority of actors started to question what was in it for them. The regions, who financed 80% of sundhed.dk, wanted to see their requests being realized: âWhen we pay for a service, we also assume that it will appear on the portalâ (representative, the regions). In particular in 2009, when sundhed.dk decided to do most development of services in-house as opposed to development by external consultants, it was a challenge for them to keep up with the pace of demands since âthe pipeline was getting too tightâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). A representative from one of the regions, who argued that the production line was too limited with the consequence of delayed projects, confirmed this observation: ââ¦ there has been a shift from being a client to being a vendor, and this has been a challenge for sundhed.dk. Mostly because the production line has become very narrow [â¦] and there has been too many things that have been important for the regions, but we donât want to constantly discuss prioritizing those services that are included on sundhed.dkâ (representative, the regions). The request for the future was that the organization behind sundhed.dk would be able to develop projects in parallel."
82,105,0.949,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"ity space is homogeneous (containing only propositions or beliefs), the application to externalism is a bit more complicated. Within externalism many things can be reasons, so the probability space is rather diverse, containing not only beliefs and propositions, but also perceptions, memories, facts, and so on. This difficulty can however be handled as follows. First we define different spaces: a space of beliefs, a space of perceptions, a space of memories, and so on. Then we define a space which is the Cartesian product of all those spaces. And finally we decide which relation of probabilistic causality we want to focus on. Do we want to focus on perceptions causing beliefs? Or memories causing beliefs? Or beliefs causing desires? Desires causing beliefs? Deciding on the answers to these questions is necessary in order to keep a grip on the heterogenous probability space, but it is just a slight technical complication, and it is not important for the general philosophical point that (2.1) is neutral with respect to both internalism and externalism. 45 Swinburne 2001, Chapters 2, 7, and 8. 46 Goldman 1986, 5-6."

Eamon OâDwyer later recounted that: Each man in turn was brought to a large room in which they had the usual operating chair. We were tied into this chair with bands around the legs and arms, a band around the body and also a band around the neck, and into each manâs mouth an instrument was passed to keep it open. The forciblefeeding outfit was brought alongâa pint of milk with an egg broken into it, the pump and the tubing. The tubing was passed down through the mouth and into the stomach. I never had any fear of hunger striking and that was the first one, but I certainly did not like this pipe being passed down through my throat and I began to have a horror of it. I must admit that I was very much afraid of it, and often in years afterwards I woke up and felt this damn pipe or tube going down my neck like a snake.

165,8,0.949,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"different results. In the end, I concluded the issue could be framed succinctly in terms of index sensitivity to whether group displacement from even distribution is concentrated and dispersed. At any given nontrivial level of group displacement from even distribution, groups can be concentrated in a way that produces homogeneous areas for both groups, or groups can be dispersed in a way that minimizes homogeneous areas. Indices vary in their sensitivity to this aspect of uneven distribution. For example, the widely used index of dissimilarity (D) takes the same value regardless of whether displacement is concentrated or dispersed, while the separation index (S) takes higher values when displacement is concentrated and takes low values when displacement is widely dispersed. I am hardly the first to recognize the technical basis for this potential difference between indices. But I believe my discussion and review of these issues makes useful new contributions to the literature on segregation measurement. First off, the analyses I report here document that important discrepancies between different index scores are much more common than previous methodological studies have suggested. Second, the difference-of-means framework for measuring segregation I introduce here provides a new basis for understanding exactly how different indices can yield discrepant index scores. Finally, I offer analytic exercises and empirical case studies to further clarify the basis of differences between indices and dispel certain misconceptions regarding of these issues. My hope is that this monograph will contribute to a better understanding of the issues examined here and also will provide useful practical strategies for measuring and analyzing segregation. Looking back on the decade of work reflected here, I can see with hindsight that the core issues are closely interconnected. Establishing how segregation index scores related to group differences in residential outcomes was a necessary step for developing methods for conducting micro-level analysis of individual-level residential attainments that could directly account for overall segregation in a city at the aggregate level. Discovering that the residential attainments in question were rooted in a simple construct â the pairwise group proportions in the area of residence â then paved the way for a further discovery, namely, that troublesome problem of index bias could be eliminated by making surprisingly simple refinements in the calculation of pairwise group proportions. Thinking more carefully about the individual-level residential outcomes that are registered by different indices led to a better understanding of the differences between concentrated and dispersed displacement from even distribution. The interconnections among the issues are clearer in hindsight. If I had recognized them from the start, I would have avoided muddling around for so long. I offer my findings and observations on these and related matters here in hopes that others will find them useful. I apologize in advance for the many limitations of this study but also suggest that it occasionally offers original insights and new options for segregation measurement and analysis that I hope can help other researchers move the study of segregation forward. Many organizations and many people have provided support and encouragement that helped make my work possible. Over the past decade, I was fortunate to receive funding support for projects that helped me develop findings and observations"

On this front, interviewees suggested that being âwokeâ requires âcheckingâ oneâs privilege constantly, and recognising where their life experience exempts them from an understanding of racism, sexism, homophobia and other prejudices. In the following example, one interviewee reflects on how his privilege exempts them from experiencing hate speech: (47) I havenât experienced hate speech as a white cis male (Interviewee 3). There is general consensus in âwokeâ circles that white people cannot be subject to racism, as self-identifying men cannot be subject to sexism (Houlston 2017). For example, an interviewee described an incident where a student ofï¬cer at the notably âradicalâ Goldsmiths university provoked controversy by tweeting â#KillAllWhiteMenâ (Telegraph 2015). In keeping with âwokeâ conceptions of hate speech, she argued that as a woman of colour she could not be racist. With power and privilege in mind, the interviewee here highlights this incident as an example of imbalances in police protection and scrutiny on the basis of patriarchy and racism: (48) Itâs like that Baha Mustafa thing; someone will say kill all white men and then all of a sudden they are under investigation. (Interviewee 4) Interviewees strongly agreed on the importance of giving the victim the right to choose how to respond to experiences of hate crime off their own accord. One interviewee who had experienced hate speech argued that direct person attacks often prevent the victimâs ability to âcall outâ hate speech due to emotional distress and exhaustion. (49) I, as a woman of colour, really struggle speaking to someone I would deï¬ne as racist because I donât think itâs my job to make them less racist. (Interviewee 10) The interviewee here raises the issue of responsibility, and the concept of âalliesâ which is well-known in millennial âwokeâ circles. An âallyâ, in this context, is someone who claims no authority in understanding this discrimination, yet can call out and educate a perpetrator unaffected by an issue by virtue of their identity (Hess 2016). In turn, another interviewee elaborated on the importance of allies using their privilege in order to resist hate speech: (50) I donât think it should be hijab Muslim women who go and speak to BNP sympathisers, but your nice average white liberal man who just wants to do something could have that conversation. The work of having those conversations is left to the people who are most likely to experience the intolerance and allies in the room get to say nothing and not be awkward or disruptive.

152,179,0.948,interdisciplinary Perspectives On Mortality and Its Timings : When Is Death?,"best interests rather than whether death is in the patientâs best interests but, given that a withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment will inevitably cause death, this is a somewhat meaningless distinction. The Bland case was decided before the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) and thus the court gave no weight to issues of patient rights, including the right to life. However, subsequent to the HRAâs coming into force, the courts have sought to reconcile the Bland judgment with the right to life. In NHS Trust A v M; NHS Trust B v H [2001] 1 All ER 801, Butler-Sloss LJ explained that there is no violation of Article 2 ECHRâs right to life when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn because it is no longer in the patientâs best interests. This approach to interpretation of Article 2 seems to have been plucked from thin air given that there is no precedent for reading the stateâs obligations under Article 2 as subject to a best interest determination. In terms of the right to life, this may look suspiciously like we have a right to life until it is not in our best interests to continue living. While this may be a sensible, even justifiable, approach in the context of PVS patients, it is surely worrying in more general terms? Who is to decide when our lives are no longer in our best interests? And how will they know? The withdrawal of medical treatment leading to death needs to be acknowledged as a legitimate exception to the right to life, but it is a pity that more explicit reasoning has not yet been provided to reconcile the right to life with end-of-life decision-making. As the state is only ever obliged to take reasonable steps to preserve life, it may be that a focus upon both autonomy and quality of life could cast a clearer light upon when it is no longer reasonable to preserve a life. Even in the context of a PVS patient, however, the right to life and other human rights do still have meaning and value. A doctor might be able to withdraw treatment to allow the patient to die, but it would not be lawful for a hospital intruder to shoot the patient in the head, nor for the hospital to throw the patient out onto the street. We would not accept a degrading use of the patientâs body even though he is not aware of it. Thus, we do still value this human beingâand the law does too. It is a living person, not just an empty shell, or an organism which the âpersonâ has vacated."

252,43,0.948,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Let us move to the second ethical problem mentioned above, namely, the conflict between individual autonomy and public health. One could argue that the right to make autonomous decisions, including autonomous decisions over oneâs body, is limited by a harm principle: my liberty is not absolute, but is instead constrained by other peopleâs equal liberty and other peopleâs prima facie right not to be harmed by my behaviour. Indeed, it would be hard to find a reasonable ethical or political theory that does not endorse or at least is not consistent with the harm principle so formulated. At a first glance, the principle seems to apply to the case of vaccination, too: I do not have a right to autonomously decide not to vaccinate myself or my children because vaccine refusal could harm other people by exposing them to preventable infectious diseases. However, the situation might be more problematic than it might initially appear. For one thing, some people might object to the idea that there is a duty to protect other members of the community against diseases. They might believe that it would be a good thing to do so, but not that there is a moral obligation to do so, let alone that there should be a legal obligation or some other form of state coercion; for example, they might turn the argument based on the harm principle upside down and argue that what would be required of me in order to protect others would violate some of my fundamental rights (such as a right to bodily autonomy or bodily integrity). Furthermoreâand more interestingly from a philosophical point of viewâeven assuming that there is an individual moral obligation to protect others against infectious diseases, some might deny that this obligation grounds an individual moral obligation to be vaccinated. The obligation might be collective (the meaning of which I will explain in greater detail later), but not individual. The reason is that oneâs contribution to herd immunity through individual vaccination is negligible. More specifically, one might argue that, where herd immunity exists, the moral obligation on each individual to be vaccinated would be weak, since the risk of infection for other people would be very small even if a single individual were not vaccinated (Dawson 2007, p. 171). And conversely, some have argued that where vaccination coverage rate is low, there is not much ground for a moral obligation to be vaccinated within a utilitarian perspective, considering that the risk that any other individual would be infected is high anyway, even if one decides to vaccinate (Verweij 2005, p. 329). Thus, that the moral obligation to be vaccinated is grounded in considerations of public health and on the harm principle is more controversial than it might initially appear."

Anyway, browsing articles upon formalization, there is a lot of lines dealing with concrete formalisms but a few of them tries to answer why they formalize anything. For software architecture, (Allen, 1997) stated: Evidently, what is needed is a more rigorous basis for describing software architectures. At the very least, we should be able to say precisely what is intended meaning of a box-and-line description of some system.

378,172,0.948,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"born in 2009, continued economic progress will mean that over the course of their lives, they can expect to consume thirty-eight times more material goods than their grandparentsâ (Asia Society 2012). Since 2010, the WEFâs Global Risk Reports have, however, put water and food supply crises and rising greenhouse gas emissions among the top ten global risks of the next ten years. So while Chinese kids might keep on amassing ï¬nancial capital, they could never transform it into 38 times more material goods. Meanwhile, applying an exchange value or costâbeneï¬t lens in all relations does affect human value judgments and our willingness to help, relate and feel connected to others and nature. One of the ongoing examples here is the cooptation of the idea of a âSharing Economyâ by capitalist players. What started with the idea that people would make their use value items available to others (couchsurï¬ng) has been pulled into the logics of exchange value. The mind-set of âwhat could I give to others to enjoyâor enjoy with them jointlyâ is transformed into a ï¬nancialized mind-set of âwhat can I get money for from others that I did not think of before now.â The enabling technologies might be the same but the intent and purpose behind these social innovations is completely differentâas will be the relations emerging from it. I therefore side with Heyman and Ariely who suggest âthat compensations for employment and effort should be considered separately for social and monetary markets and that the level and type of compensation should be designed to ï¬t the deï¬ned relationshipâ (Heyman/Ariely 2004: 793). In conclusion we see how a blind emphasis on exchange value in mainstream accounting tools and standards has helped a situation to emerge in which the ï¬nancial sector does not serve the real economy anymore, but rules it. It does that at a tremendously high cost to societies and sustainability. Of course, one might argue that people wishing to exert power and undercut societal agreements do so without taking the detour into mainstream economic thinking and models. But when it comes to rationalizing oneâs decisions, arguing them to the public and creating narratives in which particular interests seem compatible with an image of public beneï¬t and good, they have performed a great service. Also, the reflexive ontology presented in Chap. 2 has shown that biasing frames and selective interpretations of situations are an unavoidable aspect of human existence. They can be a conscious act of strategic framing or tactical misrepresentation of information. But when it comes to understanding the effect of paradigms and their shifting we talk about much deeper sociocultural transformations. Elinor Ostrom in her 2009 Nobel Prize lecture highlights how theâof courseâ purely economic Homo economicus saga has impacted the design of institutions across the board: Designing institutions to force entirely self-interested individuals to achieve better outcomes has been the major goal posited by policy analysts for much of the past half century. Extensive empirical research leads me to argue that instead, a core goal of public policy should be to facilitate the development of institutions that bring out the best in humans (Ostrom 2009: 435)."

As has been suggested by Levitt and Glick-Schiller, âmany migrants gain more social power, in terms of leverage over people, property, and locality, with respect to their homeland than they did before migrating. It is this complex intersection between personal losses and gains that any analysis of power within transnational social fields must grapple withâ (2004: 1013â1014). This imbalance is at the basis of an economics of exchanges that take place between family members, in which migrant men are invested with important responsibilities towards their relatives in Senegal. Remittances cover the everyday basic needs of many Senegalese households (Diagne/Rakotonarivo 2010) and migrants interviewed for this research all confirmed that they regularly send money home:7 âWhen you have a family youâre no longer alone.

We addressed the research question: Why do we lack tools for global validation and how can we help developers provide them? The answer is that validations are encoded in the software in a way (1) unusable by external tools, and (2) incapable of using global knowledge of the system. The answer is backed up by both a questionnaire and a source analysis. To overcome developersâ configuration issues, we need to externalize configuration access specifications and use a unified configuration library. The empirical data backs up that this is possible and wanted. It is possible, because currently different configuration accesses are used interchangeably. It is wanted, because users stated that different forms of configuration access sources should be able to override each other.

124,204,0.948,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"on the agents themselves. A non-empty set of agents is postulated, and the choice function indicates what choices each will have at each juncture in branching time. But little else is normally said about the nature of the agents and about what distinguishes one agent from another other than brute non-identity. Belnap has remarked17 that in a branching spacetime system, it is possible to associate each agent with a unique set of point events, the set of those at which the agent is present. This is made possible by the fact that distinct agents cannot occupy the same place at the same time. Unfortunately, if we look merely at branching time, with no basis for discussion of spatial dimensions, no such simple account of the identity of agents is possible. However, the usual constraints imposed on the choice function, including in particular the constraint independence of agents, do make it possible for us to look at agents in new ways. In particular, we can give some formal substance to, and gain some new insight into, the view that an agent is the sum of the choices she makes and thus that an agent is a work in progress, existentially shaping her character and her very identity through her choices. In a Belnapian world, the constraint independence of agents assures that, strictly speaking, no two agents will be presented with the same choices at a given moment in time. Of course at the restaurant both may be choosing between having the scallops and having the mussels, but that is only to say that the choices facing one may be descriptively like those facing the other. For one thing, even if they both choose the scallops, for example, they will not get the same scallops. But more significantly, agent a is choosing what a will order (and, presumably, eat), not what agent b will order. So even confining attention to a single moment, agents are normally18 differentiated from one another by the choices they face. If we shift attention to the choices agents make, not just the choices they face, this becomes even clearer: even at a single moment, provided only that the agents are active, they are differentiated by their activity, which is to say: by the choices they make. Widening our perspective to scan a history within which a moment falls, we find the agent making a succession of choices which cumulatively help define that very history, setting it apart, choice by choice, from others that had been available. The totality of those choices will be absolutely unique to a given agent, no matter whether we focus on the menu of choices the agent faces or on the choices the agent selects from that menu. Seeing this accumulation of choices along the history as uniquely associated with one agent, we can begin to consider it as constituting that agent, in which case as we survey the history we now get a strong sense of what it might mean to say that the agent is creating herself by her choices. In a different history, pursued by making different choices, she would have become a different person. 17 At the Î±EONâ10 Conference, Fiesole, Italy, 2010. 18 There is one kind of exception to this generalization: at a given moment two agents might be"

For instance, when people were cooking in their homes, we would detect a peak in our data, but could not determine precisely what it was. It could have been simple water vapor, since this equipment does not distinguish materials nor does it ï¬rst dry the air before counting. There is always room, therefore, for some speculation, which makes the logging of personal activities and observations very important. When someone is doing jobs in the house, it makes a lot of difference as to when the person is demolishing a wall, dusting or washing the dishes. Simply observing data does not provide the proper insight; it always needs to be cross-referenced with additional reliable information for interpretation within the proper context. The backpack project was extensively covered by the local TV and newspaper media. One reporter had registered himself as volunteer and took part in the exercise, allowing him to report ï¬rst-hand about his experiences. You can watch the TV coverage of the project here (in Dutch): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= M7619Gzbwzw. In general, we can reconï¬rm that both the contribution to air pollution and exposure is very individual and lifestyle-dependent. Lifestyle is not just the voluntary exercise of ï¬lling the day with activities; it also has to do with the involuntary activities imposed by labor commitments and other behavioral aspects that are deï¬ned more by the reigning socio-economic culture and paradigm than self-aware, voluntary choice.

Never been big talkers, any of us really.â None of the sons report a negative relationship with their mothers, and the middle-class boys in particular think they resemble her as well in some ways: âI have gotten a bit from mother and a bit from fatherâ, Trond says. This identification with both parents may also be the case in families where the mother has a more traditional role in the family or the fatherâs masculinity is seen as outdated: Morten says that he is âa dreamer like my fatherâ and that they share many fields of interest, but that he is more like his mother, who was a stay-at-home mum for many years, when it comes to logic, structure and leadership. Anders finds his mother more intelligent and interesting to talk with than his old-fashioned working-class father. Still, the mothersâ qualities are seldom elaborated upon and analysed in the same intense way as those of the fathers. The description of the mother is less pronounced and sometimes laced with a somewhat condescending tone. Mothers are more often than fathers described primarily in the context of the sonsâ needs: she is kind, she may help with school work and she is often the one with whom they can talk about emotional issues. Most of the sons feel emotionally closer to their mothers than to their fathers. Where fathers emerge as the parent who does things, mothers emerge as the communicative ones. On the more negative side comes the mothersâ obsession with tidiness or a tiresome tendency towards control and nagging. But in contrast to what we saw among the grandfathers, we do not hear about the subdued mother for whom to feel sorry. In the narratives of the sons, she is rather taken for granted as the kind and understanding person she is. This may be a result of their young age, but it probably also reflects the fact that modern mothers who have their own life outside the family rarely fit easily into the role as victim.6 In spite of working mothers and more present fathers in this generation, the different roles of mothers and fathers in the eyes of their sons are surprisingly unchanged.

14,232,0.948,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"Symbolic Ethnicity and Race Another important question that should be discussed when talking about ethnic identity is the question of whether ethnicity is a matter of choice and how it is connected to race. According to Gans (1979), ethnicity in time becomes optional and people who keep ties with their ethnic identities are making this choice voluntarily because they can gain something positive from it. But Gans formulated his theory of âsymbolic ethnicityâ in reaction to the so-called âethnic revivalâ among the third generation âimmigrantsâ in the U.S. and the group he was referring to were âWhiteâ (non-racialized) immigrants. The same counts for Richard Alba, who suggests a great deal of choice in the case of ethnicity (Alba 1990). On the other hand, authors, who studied ânon-Whiteâ (racialized) minorities in the U.S. (Waters 1990, Kibria 2002), present a completely different picture when talking about symbolic or voluntary ethnic identity. In the case of Asians, Nazli Kibria argues that âa part of their ethnicity is not optional and they cannot, in the perception of others, unlike white ethnics who practice symbolic ethnicity, slip in and out of âbeing ethnicââ (Kibria 2002, 101). For most of the study participants, ethnicity was not always a matter of choice. Some of them said that this was because even if they would try to âslip outâ of being âethnic,â others would not let them because they would always see them as different or foreign. This presumption of foreignness in the eyes of others does not always have to be articulated directly to be truly felt. For example, compliments paid to the research participants by other people about their perfect knowledge of the Czech language, or the estimation that they should be âexpertsâ on the topic of Vietnamese culture aroused awkward feelings among these young people, putting their identities in question. On the other hand, not everybody experienced ethnicity as something involuntary. For example, Karel, who dated a Czech girl and had almost only Czech friends, said that he had never experienced the feeling of being different. âIt is true,â he said, âthat in the beginning, when people donât know me yet, they ask about my origin.â To him, however, this was something natural and normal, which did not constrain him in claiming the identity of his choice. âOf course I know I look different, but, you know, I actually never think about it,â he said. As we have seen earlier in this chapter, race was also not a prominent issue in the case of making friends or choosing a suitable partner. What really mattered with this decision were culture, mentality, and common experiences of growing up in migrancy. Although some societal issues and involuntary ascriptions associated with racialized or non-white identities (Waters 1994) were felt by some of the interviewed children and young adults, the question of race did not constitute a major concern for them."

The extra buffer in the planned use of effort was used for improvements in quality, training, testing, and documentation (exploiting Parkinsonâs law). For the company, this decrease in productivity was not beneficial and it soon stopped rewarding accurate time predictions. The strategies of producing accurate time predictions by lowering productivity in situations with too high time predictions or cutting corners in situations with too low time predictions require the work process or product to be flexible. This is the case for much of what we do in life. If I make a bet on how long it will take to drive to work, I may be able to win the bet by adjusting my behaviour, especially if the prediction is high. If my prediction is as long as 60 minutes, I can drive slowly, stop at the gas station to fill up the tank, and spend time on searching for the perfect parking spot. If my prediction is a bit on the low side, for example, 25 minutes, I can drive fast, violate traffic rules, and park illegally. We could call the first prediction accuracy strategy work stretching (stretching work to fit a high prediction) and the second work shrinking (shrinking work to fit a low prediction). These strategies are common. Without them, our time predictions would look worseâsometimes much worseâthan they currently do. Stretching and shrinking may sometimes be acceptable, but these strategies may violate other important goals, such as productivity and quality. Take home message 1: Time predictions may affect the work, especially when it is highly flexible. Time predictions that are slightly too low may increase productivity, while those that are much too low or too high may decrease productivity. Time predictions that are too low may also lead to reductions in the quality of the work. Take home message 2: Rewarding accurate time predictions is usually not a good idea, particularly if people behave strategically and stretch the work (lower work productivity) or shrink it (lower work quality) to fit the prediction.12"

You might think of our role in the second part as similar to how US insurance companies manage care networks.

Besides the fact that these fathers wanted to spend time with the child and to care for them, several reasons brought fathers to take leave alone and to do so when the child is already a few months old. For some fathers, breastfeeding has an impact in the sharing of the leave. As many mothers breastfeed during the first 6 months, fathers will take parental leave later on, when the nursing period is over. The quotes below show the most recurrent reasons presented by the fathers we interviewed, beyond the fact that the nursing period is often reserved for the mother. Many fathers prefer to take the leave later, considering it is easier to care for an older child. I wanted to be near my daughter, and it was easier for me when she was at least 9 months.

My liberal friends rolled their eyes and stared at me with open dismay. When I tried to explain that if the same youngsters are jailed they are likely to graduate more hardened criminals than when they entered the stockades, that rehabilitation in prisons is practically unknown, and young people are often abused in jails, one of my friends stated that the next thing I would suggest would be to mark people with scarlet letters. The others changed the subject. A few weeks after this dinner conversation, a tragedy brought the merit of shaming back into public and scholarly discussion. I was a member of a panel of lawyers and academics who were asked by National Public Radio to discuss the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl in a womenâs bathroom in a Las Vegas casino (NPR 1998). The media attention this time was not focused on the father, who left his child roaming the casino at 3:30 a.m., or on the rapist-assassin Jeremy Strohmeyer, but on a friend of the murderer named David Cash (Booth 2001). He accompanied Strohmeyer to the ladyâs room but did nothing to try to stop the savaging of Sherrice Iverson or to inform the police after the act. In reaction, outraged Representative Nicholas Lampson drafted a Good Samaritan Act, which imposes severe punishments on those who do not stop a sexual crime against a child when they could do so at little risk to themselves, or who do not report such offenses to public authorities. UCLA law professor Peter Aranella, who joined the NPR conversation, argued that the punishment was too severe and suggested instead that a shorter jail sentence should suffice. Elizabeth Semil from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, also on the panel, was even more critical of the Good Samaritan draft act. She pointed out: ââ¦Punitive legislation, criminal legislation, isnât the proper response.â She also wondered out loud âwhether making it criminal to fail to act is good public policy.

Our researcher immediately launched into a detailed question about events twenty years ago, which eventually led to an in-depth one-to-one conversation and a followup at the respondentâs home. In line with her professional persona, our Morocco researcher, who interviews mainly officials, similarly prefers to set out her âcase knowledgeâ of a topic early on so as to be taken seriously. She also builds trust by showing that she knows what she is doing in procedural terms, for instance, discussing the status of the conversation as off-the-record, anonymous, and so on. But she has also experienced how, working as a pair with a researcher less steeped in local knowledge, they managed to have it both ways, using expertise and naivety in tandem. Her colleague, who had a more basic command of French, could at some point break into the interview, posing quasi-ingenuous questions that she herself did not feel able to ask, but the boldness of which could be attributed to her inability to express herself more subtly in French. A final consideration is whether to present ourselves as an âimportantâ or a very junior person. Again, our choices are very much constrained by age, gender, and position, but each of us can work with what they have. A male middle-aged full professor may well find it easier to get an appointment with an official than a young female PhD student. But by being considered more consequential, he may also be more threatening and may have less fruitful interviews. While our Morocco researcher regularly uses her doctoral title to get in the door, our Iran researcher by contrast still sometimes introduces himself as âa studentâ to diminish his importance, years after finishing his PhD."
163,34,0.948,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"theory about economic behaviours), I bow to Almâs second proposal that such theories will come mainly from outside mainstream economics. Almâs widely cited article is inspired by the work of George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton (2000) and Akerlof and Robert Shiller (2009), and proposes a view of the economy where âalternative perspectivesâ on human behaviour play a role in explaining economic decision-makingâtax evasionâin the labour arena. Third, the focus ought to shift from the modelling of individual behaviour to the aggregation of individuals. One implication according to Alm is that we should consider other taxes as well as individual income tax, another is the fact of belonging to groups always has implications on individual behaviour, regardless of whether you call these groups culture, society, organizations or whatever. Alm recognizes that the same individual does not always behave in the same way. Just because I am a woman with an academic degree, who lives in an apartment in a large urban environment and bikes to work does not mean I make the same economic decision every time. I however challenge Almâs fourth proposal, of further laboratory experiments, and his fifth proposal, of controlled field experiments, as ways forward to test proposed theories. Instead I suggest that researchers should direct their gaze to peopleâs lived experiences. There is a world out there, filled with ample examples of people living and acting under a multitude of tax regimes around the globe. In addition to clinical experiments where the modelling of experiments and the posing of questions allows us to construe peopleâs behaviour, we have to ask about and observe what people do and engage with in their everyday life. The goal for an economist is, of course, to find tools to measure the level of tax compliance or tax evasion and also to identify and explain factors that have an impact. From these, a proposed control of such factors can be suggested. As an anthropologist, it is my modest contribution to present various notions and definitions of reciprocity, beyond the usage of economic and legal literature, in order to contribute to the ââfull houseâ of strategies to measure, explain, and control the âfull houseâ of behaviors and motivationsâ (Alm 2012: 28). Economists have, for example, tested taxpayersâ willingness to comply applying theories of pro-social behaviour, where the argument is that people are more inclined to do what others do. In this vein of tax compliance research, reciprocity means that if other taxpayers pay their due taxes, other citizens would also feel obliged to pay. And the opposite also applies: in a context where many avoid paying tax, the propensity for the individual"

Ariel was answering in academic terms, and she kept answering, âIt is the probability of the patient having sight-threatening diabetic retinopathyâ and âNo, the probabilities are not objective; they are subjective estimation or guess made by AIâ. The problem with the first answer is that patients do not generally use probabilities to make decisions; they use natural frequencies. The problem with the second answer is that the clinician and the cybernetics expert did hope for an objective answer; they were not ready to accept a subjective answer; they felt AI âought to be objectiveâ. Ariel felt that AI is âsubjectiveâ since it learns from certain data. (As she found later, her logic was wrong.) The long discussion ended with the collaborators telling the risk analyst she was âbiased in her knowledge of probabilityâ. At that point, the risk analyst was annoyed. After all, she has trained all her life not to be biased. This example shows how even a seemingly simple case can turn into confusion. Without understanding the estimated risk, a patient and clinician would not know how to make a decision. Another non-medical example of miscommunication can be found in [9] (see their Chapter 7)."
385,689,0.948,Advanced R,"To understand Râs performance, it helps to think about R as both a language and as an implementation of that language. The R-language is abstract: it deï¬nes what R code means and how it should work. The implementation is concrete: it reads R code and computes a result. The most popular implementation is the one from r-project.org (http://rproject.org). Iâll call that implementation GNU-R to distinguish it from R-language, and from the other implementations Iâll discuss later in the chapter. The distinction between R-language and GNU-R is a bit murky because the R-language is not formally deï¬ned. While there is the R language deï¬nition (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html), it is informal and incomplete. The R-language is mostly deï¬ned in terms of how GNU-R works. This is in contrast to other languages, like C++ (http://isocpp.org/std/the-standard) and javascript (http: //www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), that make a clear distinction between language and implementation by laying out formal speciï¬cations that describe in minute detail how every aspect of the language should work. Nevertheless, the distinction between R-language and GNU-R is still useful: poor performance due to the language is hard to ï¬x without breaking existing code; ï¬xing poor performance due to the implementation is easier. In Section 16.3, I discuss some of the ways in which the design of the Rlanguage imposes fundamental constraints on Râs speed. In Section 16.4, I discuss why GNU-R is currently far from the theoretical maximum, and why improvements in performance happen so slowly. While itâs hard to know exactly how much faster a better implementation could be, a >10x improvement in speed seems achievable. In Section 16.5, I discuss some of the promising new implementations of R, and describe one important technique they use to make R code run faster. Beyond performance limitations due to design and implementation, it has to be said that a lot of R code is slow simply because itâs poorly written. Few R users have any formal training in programming or software development. Fewer still write R code for a living. Most people use R to understand data: itâs more important to get an answer quickly than to develop a system that will work in a wide variety of situations. This means that itâs relatively easy to make most R code much faster, as weâll see in the following chapters."

Phrased equivalently, we raised the abstraction level by moving from a specific case (flu at a boarding school) to a more general case (disease in a closed society). Very often, when developing mathematical models, we start with a specific example and see, through the modeling, that what is going on of essence in this example also will take place in many similar problem settings. We try to incorporate this generalization in the model so that the model has a much wider application area than what we aimed at in the beginning. This is the very power of mathematical modeling: by solving one specific case we have often developed more generic tools that can readily be applied to solve seemingly different problems. The next sections will give substance to this assertion."

This is also true, since caregivers frequently perceive of themselves as being sufferers in their own right: they try to locate themselves in their relativeâs memory loss and unstructured behaviour, and ask questions as to their own mortality and succumbing to the illness. Ex Memoria makes us painfully aware of what it must feel like to be spoken about. Challenged to deliberate more fully on the individualâs world of experience and perception by ï¬lmo-poetic renderings or photographic patient portrayals, we must move on to hearing patientsâ own accounts. This is also motivated by the fact that, as Vai Ramanathan puts it (and we have seen in Evaâs case), remembering âis not an individual process but a social oneâ.58 In the following two chapters, I explore ï¬rstperson accounts written by patients. Since writing, by itself and especially in the awareness of cognitive challenge, is already a sign of self-assertion, I particularly focus on how patients perceive of themselves within their condition and within such reifying and infantilising discourse."
108,65,0.948,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"trafficking of people, weapons, drugs etc., was established as in all conflicts, with various actors using violent means to establish their territories (meaning here primarily not physical territory).2 Partly, because of this professor, Mary Kaldor has described this form of conflict and this specific conflict as a new form of war. Kaldor thus writes that she has identified a new form of war which has emerged since the Cold War, involving more or less organised violence between different parties (often not states). The motives behind this phenomenon are many and varied. As I put a theoretical perspective of my own on the conflict, I would like at this point to dwell a little on Kaldorâs ideas, ideas which have met some criticism.3 Her view of the informal economy as the driving force behind the war is essentially correct; she makes a fundamental point when highlighting the presence of the criminal world as an influential force. In bourdieuan terms, one could refer to a changing social field. That said, I would like to take issue with many of the theories she promotes. One problem is that history shows us plenty of examples of the fact that the parameters for the ânewâ wars already have existed and still exist; it is easy to recognise the phenomenon from history. The informal economy is not new, certainly not where war is being waged. People in the West today are used to regarding war as something that takes place between sovereign states. However, one does not need to look too far back in time to see the processes that Kaldor describes as part of just about every nation-building process that has occurred in Europe (this is probably also true for other parts of the world, but certainly holds generally throughout Europe). She highlights globalisation as a new contributing factor to this new type of war. It must be said that the consequences of war now have a more wide-ranging influence, but that this should affect events in a qualitatively new fashion remains to be proved. Breeding grounds for unrest have taken on a new significance within criminal circles, when all sorts of illegal transport make its way through the lawless country like electricity conducted through copper.

The young doctor now has the opportunity to describe the condition of the child patient, but decides not to do so. He wants to cope with the situation on his own, without support from senior colleagues. During the night, a complication occurs with the patient, and the young doctor can again choose to consult a senior doctor, but decides not to do so, thinking that he can and should handle the situation by himself. The patient is sleeping, and the young doctor believes that the complication can be dealt with when she wakes up in the morning. The patient dies, and would most likely have survived if she had received proper, routine treatment during the night. When a hospital faces a situation of this kind, it is a test of its ability to perform an autopsy without blame (Collins, 2001), or a calm and clearheaded analysis of the chain of events where the main attention is on causes, rather than blame. It appears that the young doctor has made passive mistakes in (i) not consulting the senior doctor before he went off duty, and (ii) not calling for help when the complication happened during the night. From one perspective, these are personal mistakes for which he is accountable, while from another perspective, they are systemic mistakes. A verdict depends on whether the hospital has clarified expectations about doing things together rather than one by one. Both the real and fictitious examples of junior doctors who want to impress have a past, present, and future dimension, with corresponding questions (Table 1). It may be that the principle of seeking help when you are in doubt or at the limits of your own capabilities seems so obvious that it should Table 1"
234,72,0.947,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"One of the most tangible signs of labour substitution is the placing of professional volunteers on staff rotas. And however much we discuss with the local partner, the problems with this is it remains a high expectation whether the visitors are consultants or students. We were aware of these tensions before the start of the SVP and issued clear guidance to all parties that professional volunteers should not be placed on staff rotas except in exceptional circumstances.14 Quite understandably, local health workers are often upset about this and resent it, expecting volunteers to relieve them of very burdensome tasks. This reï¬ects misunderstandings about the role of volunteers (and of Health Partnerships and AID more generally) accentuated by years of experience of missionary-style labour substitution voluntarism. Some local health workers will challenge the decision not to permit volunteers to go on rotas, suggesting that volunteers are work-shy voluntourists and more interested in going on safaris than supporting them. And this may well reï¬ect their experience of volunteers. Challenging this culture of volunteering has proved a challenge within the SVP but we are conï¬dent that consistency in response is essential. The following Ugandan clinician who was part of a focus group argues forcefully against allowing volunteers to go on staff rotas on the basis that this will undermine co-working and encourage absenteeism: I donât support the idea that they go on the rota. I would not support that â they will leave all the work to her (the volunteer). Iâve seen it. Once you add"

The common example is when the user is asked for an opinion about the content that is being presented. For instance, the user assigns rating to the visited job offer from defined scale. This evaluation could be used for finding similar offers, i.e. if the user likes some offer and assigns it high rating we can suppose that will also like similar ones. This is an example for an explicit feedback. By explicit feedback the user can indicate either positive or negative interaction, e.g. when the user clicks on the button âMore detailsâ indicates a positive interaction or eventually negative interaction by clicking on the button âNot interestedâ. When the user's work is not interrupted we are talking about implicit feedback. It requires collecting of evidence and making deduction before it influences the user model. For example, user might read detailed information about a job offer only to find it not interesting after all details are known. Implicit feedback often introduces inference errors to the user model. Explicit feedback has higher priority than implicit feedback because involves the user (Callaway & Kuflik, 2005) however implicit is more preferred because it has little or no impact on the user's normal work activity (Middleton, 2003). If we take into account web-based applications the user uses a web browser to access the content represented as web pages. During browsing the web pages it happens many times that the user reaches the content, which she does not want to read or just wants to go one or more steps back in the navigation. To accomplish this intent the user presses the Back button and gets to previous page. This gives very important information to the user modeling. From pressing Back button we can infer information about user's interest about the content that is being presented. If the user had spent enough long time before he pressed Back button we can suppose that the presented content is interesting and make changes in the user model. As a main source for modeling process we consider information collected from the user. Usually there are not too many options how to elicit especially personal information without asking. The mostly used form is questionnaires where the user has several closed questions, i.e. prepared answers are provided and the user only needs to pickup one or more. The amount of the questions and appropriate formulation is very important to make the user do activities, which are not directly related to her goal, i.e. to work with the application. Otherwise the user could be prone to choose answers that do not represent her or choose answers without reading them only to go through very fast. Similarly, sometime the user does not know the correct answer of the questions (e.g. she has not achieved required knowledge yet) or does not want to talk about it because it is too private for them (Rich, 1998). At last we should not forget psychological aspect of answering questions. People use to see themselves in better light than they in fact are. In this case is all the effort useless. Sometimes is better to work with smaller amount of information than with the large set that is inaccurate. This form of the information acquiring is useful when the user starts using the application for the first time and the user model needs to be initialized. Therefore questionnaires should be unobtrusive as much as possible not to discourage"
321,152,0.947,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"School Education Is Losing Diversity One current problem facing school education is that the presence of isolated students is tolerated less as society matures. The teaching certificate system is also becoming excessively complex over time. When I was a college student, educational psychology and other pedagogical subjects were available to students whenever they decided to obtain, even belatedly, a teaching certificate. Some prospective applicants did not even take such subjects. At that time, however, necessary credits were sometimes given to students when they took a 1.8-liter bottle of sake (called an isshobin) to the professor in charge to ask for a credit. There was something easygoing about those days. Today, such a practice as bribery with an isshobin would not be tolerated, of course. Instead, the fact is that students are now obliged to decide whether they want a teaching certificate as early as their high-school days and take the required teacher training program in college. Only those students are qualified to teach. Thus, educational venues are losing diversity of human resources. Diversity has also been lost in the lives of students. No parents want their children to become delinquents. It is a pity that today we have few people, including parents, who can give advice to would-be delinquents from their own experience by saying that they were once delinquents but they now live like this, or by giving them examples from overseas. To build such an environment, we need people who have diverse experiences. The loss of diversity among school teachers may be a significant factor in current educational problems. To improve the educational system, it is advisable to send about three sufficiently experienced working people, for instance, to each elementary school or junior high school as instructors to give lessons at least three times a week. Currently, there are a few cases in which well-known TV celebrities or media personalities give lessons at their old schools. Such activities are not part of education in the true sense of the word. The basis of school education lies in giving 45-minute classes for several hours a week, throughout the year."

This has not captured the imagination of policy makers, nor generated policies to put the principle to work. Despite its achievements, this is the tragedy of the democratic peace. What about the future of Rummelâs work? I have two forecasts. Optimistically, by mid-century (echoing Diamond, 2003) we will have near global democracy. A widespread realization will emerge that without more democracy, interstate violence will remain a constant threat to peace, and mass murders and genocides will continue. Based on this change in global consciousness âan enormous paradigm shiftâthere will be functional alliance of democracies to put the democratic peace into practice, and we will be on the way toward a Pax Democratica. Pessimistically, democracy will still be a âgood thing,â and democratization will ebb and flow in the world. But because of the allure of power, and the difï¬culties in actually limiting it, there will still not be any widespread sense of urgency about fostering, nudging, or making pro-democracy regime changes. We will not realistically and reliably achieve what Rummel dreamed about: world peace, between nations and within them. Regime type will be ignored, war and democide will remain. We shall see."
386,70,0.947,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"2.4 Concluding Thoughts on Hierarchy The public administration is a convenient case to become familiar with the structure of hierarchies. Max Weberâs âiron cageâ is a powerful image to illustrate the unconditionality of hierarchies: if you want to stay in the system, you have to obey, no matter what! Research in the 100 years since Weberâs death, however, has contributed to softening the iron cage by asking naughty questions. Would the organisational units really need the expanding budget they claimed to need? Were they able to control what they claimed to control? Could the organisational structures be adapted to organisational patterns in businesses? And could the costs the administration was causing be justified? Businesses dealing with each other are already a lecture in âhierarchies for the advancedâ. Economic models start to get complicated as soon as power asymmetries are to be considered. However, power asymmetries in the chain are the rule rather than the exception in the economy. Or have you ever wondered why your insurance puts you on hold when you call them, though you wouldnât do that to them when they call you, let alone why they never actually call you? Finally, hierarchies in the family will be all too âfamiliarâ to most of us. However, these hierarchies are extremely dynamic. Apparently, we should be kind to our kids in family businesses, because later on todayâs small pests will be responsible for the very fate of the business. By now, readers may have formulated a naughty question of their own: what does all of this have to do with agriculture? More than with, for instance, the educational administration, the health sector or families running a taxi business? Well, many findings of this section can be transposed to other sectors. Agriculture is just a worldwide melting pot with an extremely long tradition that has collected many, and significant, cultural habits. And as the food trade is arguably the most essential backbone of every economy, the farming sector serves as an ideal case in point for the significance of socioeconomics."
51,283,0.947,How Generations Remember,"his former school friends of other nationalities may rather mean that Å½eljko does not see them as enemies because he was never âforcedâ to classify them along a friendâenemy framework. Indeed, Bosniaks and Serbs from pre-wartime were friends and may remain friends (in Å½eljkoâs memory) because they left Mostar, but Bosniaks (and Serbs) whom Å½eljko meets today cannot become friends anymore because this would dangerously blur the boundary between Bosniaks and Croats, thereby threatening Croat existence. This fear of the Croat nationsâ assimilation and absorption is clearly in line with the dominant Croat public discourse. Nevertheless, as opposed to the Croat professor introduced in Chap. 3, who is professionally involved in rewriting history and denies any positive experiences of Yugoslavia, Å½eljkoâs narrative includes positive personal memories of Yugoslav times. At several points during our interview Å½eljko came to realise the discrepancies between the dominant Croat discourse he follows when narrating the present situation and the divergent discourse when narrating his personal experiences of pre-wartime. The explanation he gave for it, however, rested on the argument that he was simply ignorant during the period of Yugoslavia. He claimed he was not politically sensitive enough to realise his nation was being repressed (including the economic injustices of, for example, Western Herzegovina, a region dominated by Croats). He blames his ignorance on his age, stating he was too young and more interested in playing football than engaging in serious subjects. Not only on the subject of national coexistence but also his position towards the church and ongoing present language politics demonstrate how Å½eljko is caught between different discourses. Although he ideologically supports Croat national politics, from time to time he reverts to interpretative templates from Yugoslav times. In terms of language, Å½eljko says how amusing it is that his children do not understand some of the words he uses, words that are today regarded as Serb and have been replaced by âproper Croatâ words. From what he told me, I initially concluded that his children are exposed to this revised language in school while he himself is unwilling to change his language, but I learned otherwise: No, no, no when we were in school we were taught in what was called Serbo-Croatian and it was predominantly Serb.

Generally, we think thatâs exciting and a good thing, but it also means that itâs a challenge for universities and departments when it comes to evaluation and promotion. This is increasingly problematic and becoming more acute. ... My conception of interdisciplinarity is that it is one person whose work is addressed to multiple communities. When that is the case, it may be hard for those communities to feel like the person is fully theirs. Sometimes the closest fields have the most difficulty agreeing on standards of excellence and what is authorship. That can be dangerous for junior faculty. [It] requires that junior faculty must be very proactive, making sure they are communicating with their groups [and] must have a disciplinary home, a core discipline. If you veer too far from home, that can be dangerous. E5: On the one hand, the interdisciplinary trend is, in some parts of the competitive stream, encouraged; thatâs the ERC trend, the European Science Foundation trend (essentially the ERC trend) and also in some parts of national funding. For example, our government in Denmark strongly encourages interdisciplinary research and, in a recent evaluation of the research council system that was published a few years ago, it was one of the major recommendations. So thatâs one trend. You have goals that prioritise interdisciplinary research and on the other hand you have very strong gearing of governing publications that have a very good track record, have a very high gate impact factor, and so forth. And that sort of pushes research towards overspecialisation. E14: Some will promote interdisciplinary research. ... But research is mainly monodisciplinary in our humanities faculty although politics and the rectorat tend to encourage interdisciplinary research. The basic issue is that the institutional incentives may be working in contradictory directions. When it comes to individual hiring and promotion, publishing monodisciplinary books and journals is paramount. But, at the same time, some funding bodies and senior academic administrators are promoting interdisciplinary research. This tension can manifest itself in a number of ways. Career advancement: There is a possible tension between the promotion of interdisciplinary research projects and publication regimes. As we have seen, a scholarâs"
308,221,0.947,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Jesus warned against the teachers of the law and Pharisees and called them hypocrites: âHow terrible for you teachers of the Law and Pharisees. You hypocrites. You lock the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in the peopleâs faces, and you yourselves donât go in, nor do you allow in those who try to enterâ (Mathew 23/1327, Luke 11/39-42, 52, 20/47) [14]. Jesus had many sermons to his followers in which he asked them to give all their property to the poor and needy, and to forgive all who wronged them. He said in the Sermon on the Mount (Mathew 5/3-12): âHappy are those who are humbleâ¦Happy are those who are merciful to othersâ¦Happy are the pure in heartâ¦Happy are those who work for peaceâ¦â [15]. Love for enemies (Mathew 5/43): âLove your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.â Teachings about revenge (Mathew 6/38, Luke 6/29-30) [15]: âYou have heard that it was said: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But now I tell you: do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, let him slap you on the left cheek tooâ¦when someone asks you for something, give it to him.â He warned against performing religious duties in public as hypocrites do. (Mathew 6/1-17) [15]. âDo not store up riches for yourselves here on earth, where moths and rust will destroy it and robbers break in and steal. Instead, store up riches for yourselves in heavenâ (Mathew 6/19-20) âYou cannot serve both God and moneyâ (Mathew 6/24) [15]. The teachings of Jesus were very hard to follow. Only very few could raise themselves to this high standard of beneï¬cence, charity, and nobility. All through Christian history only saints were capable to fulï¬ll what Jesus ordered his followers to practice. The rich young man came to Jesus asking to receive the eternal life. He ordered him to worship and love God (the 10 commandments), but the young man asked for more Jesus said, âGo and sell all you have and give the money to the poor and you will have riches in heavens then come and follow me. The young man went away as he was very rich and the disciples said: âWho then can be saved? Jesus answered: This is impossible for man, but for God everything is possibleâ (Mathew 19/16-26) [16]. The beneï¬cence ordered by Jesus was considered by his followers as supererogatory as it can never be reached and practiced except by saints. However, Jesus gave a very good example of beneï¬cence that could be done by ordinary person. This is the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10/25-37) [17]. The Samaritans were considered nonbelievers by Jews. They had their own temple in Mount Gerzim in Samaria (near Nables today), and refused to go to Mount Temple in Jerusalem. They only acknowledged the Torah and refused the other books of Old Testament. They also refused the Talmud. Jesus said: âThere was once a man who was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when robbers attacked him, stripped him and beat him up leaving him half dead. It so happened that a priest was going that road, but when he saw the man, he walked on by on the other side.

244,45,0.947,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","ETS is a nonprofit educational measurement organization with public service principles deeply rooted in its progenitors and in Section 501(c)3. Both its progenitors and the framers of the tax code were interested in the same thing: providing a social benefit. A corollary of this history is that the purpose of a nonprofit measurement organization like ETS is not about making money. Its purpose is not even about making money to support its mission (because that, in itself, would be a nonexempt purpose). Its purpose is about doing its mission, making enough money in the process to continue doing it in better and bigger ways. Third, it is reasonable to argue that, in the twenty-first century, renewed meaning can be brought to ETSâs mission by attacking big challenges in education and measurement, such as using assessment to guide instruction, measuring new constructs to help individuals with educational choices, and using assessment to increase diversity. Interestingly, many of these big challenges are the same ones that motivated the organizationâs progenitors. Those individuals knew these were hard problems but they had faith that those problems could be solved. To solve them, ETS and organizations like it will need to act more responsively and more responsibly than ever before. Make no mistake: If ETS succeeds in being responsive without being responsible, or in being responsible without being responsive, it will have failed. ETS, and kindred organizations, must do both. Doing both is what it means to be a nonprofit educational measurement organization in the twenty-first century.

360,445,0.947,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"The applicability of the A-T view to cognitive science is seen acutely in what we have been discussing throughout this article: property veriï¬cation judgments and subsequent modiï¬cations made to those judgments. To show this applicability, it is perhaps best to begin with a general explanation of how a property veriï¬cation judgment is made (in its strictest sense) on the A-T view (i.e., through what Aristotle and Aquinas call episteme or scientia, respectively), and then present how the same approach might account for the sort of property veriï¬cation results encountered in our experiment. On the A-T view, property veriï¬cation in its strictest sense occurs in virtue of understanding how a given property is explanatorily useful in knowing the nature of the thing in which the property is found. In other words, in the A-T view, to do property veriï¬cation is to verify that a characteristic is, in fact, a property of the thing (i.e., that it is a characteristic that flows from the essence of the thing). To put the matter concretely, we can ask, âHow does one decide whether birds have wings?â but with the understanding that we are actually asking how one decides whether wings is a proper accident (flowing from the essence) of bird. On the A-T view, property veriï¬cation in this strict sense will occur when we understand why the property regularly occurs in the kind of thing of which we are predicating the property. Note that in the A-T view, much of what we âknowâ about the world, even though a reliable guide for action, etc., is not actually known in the strict sense of episteme or scientia. We return to this point below. Now, as we have pointed out above, judgments are not made by looking in the concept to see if there is a property there, but rather through a judgment about the"
8,305,0.947,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","16.3 Is the Question About the âFinal Building Blockâ Meaningless? There is the final question that remains: suppose, that everything were correct; there is an infinite number and an exponential mass spectrum of new types of particles and a corresponding limiting temperatureâwhat does that have to do with the here presented end situation, which nevertheless does not mean an end? Here we enter into a theoretical construction wherein one abstracts a general rule from a limited number of experimental data, which is then tentatively postulated as a universal principle. This introduces us to the usual practical circumstance of theoretical physics: we have a model whose other properties are analytically derived using established methods of mathematics and the assumptions that generally apply to the already known laws of nature. In this way we obtain experimentally testable predictions as derived from known or later verifiable behavior. Agreement of these predictions with the facts is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure that the theoretical model is correct. This applies especially to the model I will now describe. In order to introduce the model in words, I will characterize the situation far less exactly than the technical tools of theoretical physics would allow me to do this. I proceed in this way as I seek at all cost to avoid technical jargon. In a high-energy collision new material particles are copiously produced (events with a multiplicity of a hundred or more have been observed). In our terminology, these particles emerge from the collision-produced boiling primordial matter. In a certain and physically quite precise sense they were all contained in this piece of boiling primal matter. Taking one of these newly generated particles under the microscope (which is not easy: lifespan '10 23 s), we observe that it behaves itself as boiling primordial matter; namely it can decay further into many particles. The greater its mass, the greater is this tendency. Such a particle with a large mass thus has a dual nature: on the one hand, it can be used as an âelementary particleâ contributing to radiative energy equilibrium, on the other hand it can itself create other âelementary particlesâ which contribute to the radiative energy equilibrium. Seen from this perspective, none of these produced particle types can be viewed as an elementary particle, given that other particles can emanate from any of the produced particles, which are again no more elementary since each can be simultaneously created out of the other, and in this way all these particles have undetermined building block composition. Nothing in this picture changes if one day quarks should be confirmed as the primordial building blocks. In our approach they would play a preferential role, being the stuff from which âeverything is built.â As an aside, it is the virtue of our approach that the statement âcomposed ofâ does not characterize the number and the character of the fundamental building blocks. The composition and nature of the source of produced particles can remain cloaked in mystery; it can remain undetermined. The model aims to overcome the limited number of presently known types of particles by continuing the observed behavior of the mass spectrum at low mass to higher mass, (where we experimentally know nothing yet).

It should not simply identify as true what proves useful (although a notion of use will indeed be important). It should ask how people act in contexts in which the concept of knowledge makes sense. The strategy just outlined has already been employed by Craig (1990), who introduced an additional reflection to make his point: What is called knowledge can be best constructed in contrast to a sociocognitive state of nature without or before If what I shall say is along the right lines, the core concept of knowledge is an outcome of certain very general facts about the human situation; so general, indeed, that one cannot imagine their changing whilst anything we can still recognise as social life persists. Given those facts, and a modicum of self-awareness, the concept will appear; and for the same reasons as caused it to appear, it will then stay (p. 10)."

383,46,0.947,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"The description and measurement of risk is about developing an understanding of the risk. It can be done qualitatively or quantitatively. The quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is also called probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). Formally, in a risk analysis, we are attempting to envision how the future will turn out if the decision maker undertakes a certain course of action (or inaction). The risk analysis answers the following four questions: â¢ What can happen? What can go wrong? What can go well? Can we create a list of all outcomes that can happen? What are the positive outcomes and negative outcomes? â¢ For each outcome, if it does happen, what are the consequences? What are the benefits or losses for each stakeholder? Some consequences can be small, some large. For example, an earthquake can have catastrophic consequences albeit with a small probability. Some consequences can be positive, some negative. How outcomes link to consequences? This may not be known fully, so a statistical analysis of causes may be done, or experts can be called for their opinion. Who are the stakeholders, i.e. people affected by outcomes? In the example of Janette getting a job, she is a stakeholder, additionally, her parents are stakeholders because if she gets a well-paid job, her parents do not need to support her as much or at all. Each stakeholder has some attitude toward each consequence; in future, we will call such attitudes the utilities. â¢ How likely is each outcome to happen? What is the likelihood or probability of the wrong outcome happening? What is the probability of a positive outcome? Some probabilities can be large, some very little. Is probability a useful way to measure uncertainty? There are other measures that we will learn later. â¢ What is the strength of knowledge that we have? What do we use to calculate the probabilities of events? Do we use past data or expert knowledge? Do we trust the expert(s)? Are data relevant? Do we have enough data? Are data noisy? The four answers to the questions above constitute four elements of risk,"

The civilian participation part was especially ï¬lled with desires and expectations, but also a total lack of knowledge. We needed to build up experience along the way. Each step would become decisive in regard to the next ones that would need to be taken. Whatever we planned was always challenged by a different outcome than expected. Adapting, changing, or adjusting our approach continuously became part of a co-creation routine that gave us insight for enlargement of the programme in Eindhoven, as well as other regions. This adaptive flexibility was also the basis for the outcome, which proved to be much more diverse and complete than could have been anticipated. Phase 3, hence, has provided us with unique know-how about and insights into human behavior, influences, and participation in processes of change. We also learned a lot about the way surroundings influence the behavior of people, personal leadership, perception, and the effect of awareness on people as to whether or not to take initiative. We learned about human motivation, persuasion, passive and active innovation, responsibility, and the stimulus of human productivity, including entrepreneurship. The living lab setting was our own city of Eindhoven and its surroundings. A whole new reality revealed itself to us, together with the complexity of dealing with change and value-driven innovation."

Often the purpose was merely, as in the story above, to get bribes from detainees in exchange for their release. Sometimes, police officers rounded up all the young men that they could find. Those who couldnât prove that they were studying or working were sent off to the army, backed by a law against vagrancy. At other times, the police entered the barrios with the purpose of finding and eliminating personal foes or criminal elements. As Juan Alberto recalls it, police incursions in the poor neighborhood constituted a constant potential threat of violence: When I was a kid it wasnât the fear of the malandros (street gangs/criminals) that stopped us from hanging out in the street, it was the risk that the police would come. Sometimes they came and just rounded up all the men who were there, or sometimes they came to look for someone specific and then it was shooting and shooting and no one was safe. I remember once they were looking for my neighbor Johnny who was living in front of me, we were friends when we were younger, but then he became a malandro â¦. I was standing on the roof of our house watching it â¦ the police came banging on his door, yelling âwhere is he, where is he,â his girlfriend was standing on the floor in the patio (backyard) screaming and screaming â¦ the police stormed in and searched all the rooms, they found him in his bed, and they shot him dead right there in his bed."

Although the psychological and motivational points of departure are different, the results will in both cases be a strong emotional investment in gender difference, and in the moral order that sustains such differences, including the complementarity that is seen as necessary to bridge the gap. Although male sexuality has to be kept in check, even harsher rules apply to women: while men can be wild for a certain period and then develop into responsible adults, women do not enjoy the same freedoms. To be sexually wild will destroy their quality as potential mothers and wives. To the men, the possibility of female sexuality seems to go against nature, and the few who have experienced being approached by women find it almost monstrous. They cannot relate female sexuality to their emotional experiences of femininity, and sometimes their unconscious fears about it are activated. The women themselves also stick to the distinction between âcheapâ and âniceâ girls, although most of them did have sex with their future husbands after being formally engaged. There seems to be less feelings of guilt involved in this for the women than for the men, possibly because the initiative came from their fiancÃ©s. According to all the women in the eldest generation, the positive aspect of the strict norms was the lack of pressure on a girl to have sex before she was engaged. If a girl was pressured (and many tell us about hot and impatient suitors), she had the unquestionable right to say no. Unlike the men, none of the women say that following those rules was in conflict with their own sexual needs. The women are even less willing than the men to talk about their own sexual experiences in the interviews. One says straight out that she does not want to talk about this, and in other cases this unwillingness is so strongly implied that the interviewer simply skips the questions related to sexuality. Those who do say something about their own sexuality are very brief. Ellen, a middle-class woman born in 1923 who waited to have sex until after her wedding, says briefly that she experienced it as a natural thing when it happened and that she had just followed her own feelings and instincts. But apart from Ellen those who say anything at all refer to sex as something they did mainly because their male partner wanted"

IAEA, 2005). In addition, in the report of Cardis in 2006, it is said that the number of deaths is expected to be 16,000 people (CRIEPI, health effects of Chernobyl Research Center for Radiation Safety Accident http://criepi.denken. or.jp/jp/ldrc/study/topics/20060904.html). The Fukushima nuclear accident was evaluated to be INES level 7. Therefore, calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective dose is unavoidable. If someone calculates the number of deaths based on radiation by this accident as a few hundred people, how is this to be explained to the public, especially the people of Fukushima? At this time, we have no answer to the question: âHow do I know if my child will be one of the few hundred victims?â. Nowadays, we cannot identify whether this cancer is due to radiation. In the future, some cancer patients will likely go to court about the Fukushima nuclear accident. If the court decides to accept a causal connection between low dose and cancer, I am concerned that all cancer will be viewed as radiation. This situation is like the atomic bomb case. In my opinion, it is against humanism to calculate the number of deaths. We should rethink the meaning of low dose radiation risk. I propose to develop two things. One is a total health risk evaluation. The other is a minus-dose evaluation. The total health risk evaluation is to be considered with radiation, ultra-violet ray, chemical material, mental stress, etc., to evaluate human health risk. Nowadays, only the radiation risk is evaluated quantitatively and gives some cause for anxiety. Therefore, it is important to know that radiation is not a special cancer risk compared with other risks even if this evaluation has a huge uncertainty. Moreover, minus-dose evaluation is more important. Today, Linear Non-Threshold model (LNT model) can evaluate the cumulative radiation risk forever. Therefore, people have no way to escape radiation to reduce risk. On the other hand, we can find protection functions in our body, for example DNA repair, apoptosis, radioadaptive response, and immunity. This means radiation damage in our body is continually being repaired by these functions. To make quantity evaluations of these functions we can calculate that the dose was canceled by these minusdoses. For example, to increase our immunity function to reduce cancer risks quantitatively, we use methods of ordinary health promotion (for example, spas) so that our radiation risk will be canceled and our health will actually become better."

For epistemic responsibility this means that as responsible epistemic agents, we intentionally assume responsibility for what we claim to know. In full awareness of our socio-technical epistemic entanglement, we accept to be challenged for what we claim to know, we commit ourselves to provide evidence for our claims and to revise our beliefs in the light of new evidence. Hence, to understand and improve our processes of knowing, to be responsible knowers as individuals, we first need to acknowledge both the deep entanglements between the social, the technical and the epistemic as well as between epistemology, ethics and ontology. However, the only adequate reaction to this awareness must be to assume responsibility as an intentional act. It is only we humans (so far?) that can take this stance, hence it is our duty to assume responsibility for our interrelated ways of knowing, being and doing. However, what is also clear is that the ease with which epistemic responsibility can be assumed differs between different socio-technical environments: in some environments assuming responsibility for what one knows is rather easy, in others it is much more difficult. Access to various types of evidence, to supporting or contradicting information is essential to become epistemically responsible in knowing. It is in this sense that supporting open access is a very important and valid aspect of Responsible Research and Innovation. More generally it means that our individual efforts must be complemented with appropriate policies that support environments in which epistemic responsibility assumption is enabled, fostered and incentivized."

384,32,0.947,Practical Economics : Economic Transformation and Government Reform in Georgia 2004â2012,"I refuse to believe that corruption is innate in any person or society. Corruption results from poor choices, and it is the main obstacle for any country to grow. Some countries may grow despite high levels of corruption, usually fueled by natural resources. But such growth is not sustainable, and it doesnât create a middle class capable of serving as the backbone of a stable society, unless substantial reforms are conducted in time. Until 2004, Georgia had been in the hands of leaders who accepted corruption as a lesser evil. But in 2003, the Rose Revolution changed the game. The crisis engendered an unprecedented willingness to change, as well as a sense of urgency shared by everyone. The vast majority of the population was fed up with being cheated out of their own country by the ruling elite and its accomplices. An approval rate of 80 percent for the new government and its reform program gave us a clear mandate to clean up the country. This mandate cut across all levels of society and all political parties, and we were determined not to let this rare opportunity go to waste. And while Georgia today is far from ï¬awless, few would deny that it is in an inï¬nitely better place than Georgia in 2003. Paradoxically, it was the crisis that helped us do it. Without the crisis, we would never have been able to turn things around in Georgia. When I look back now, I see the crisis as a blessing in disguise, despite all the hardship that it brought about. The reforms we implemented to ï¬ght corruption in Georgia produced fast results. In a 2003 survey conducted by Transparency International, more than two-thirds of the respondents (67 percent) had said they expected the level of corruption to increase, or stay at the same level, within the next three years. Only one year later, that ï¬gure was down to 11 percent.

Now, what specific types of policies individuals have a moral obligation to support, and institutions have the responsibility to implement, depends on the efficacy of possible alternative policies in realizing herd immunity and on their moral costs, for example, in terms of liberty infringements and fairness violations. Other things being equal (e.g., if two types of policies are equally effective in realizing herd immunity), less intrusive policies are to be preferred (Verweij ad Dawson 2004) according to a widely shared principle of âleast restrictive alternativeâ in public health. The analysis and application of this principle to vaccination policies will be the topic of the next chapter. The reason why a principle of least restrictive alternative requires a separate discussion is that it raises more problems than it actually solves. In particular, one might ask (1) which vaccination policies can be considered less restrictive than others, and therefore ought to be preferred, and (2) what goal exactly ought to be pursued through vaccination policies, that is, whether herd immunity or something else. I will address these two questions in Chaps. 3 and 4, respectively. In Chap. 3, I will assume the widely shared view that herd immunity should be the goal of vaccination policies, which also follows from the arguments I have provided in this chapter; in Chap. 4, I will suggest that vaccination policies ought to be more ambitious: the fact that in this chapter I have argued that vaccination policies should at least aim at herd immunity does not mean that they should not aim at something even more ambitious, if some justification for this more ambitious target can be provided."

In his view it is not the money itself that makes it svart or not, but the amount and the context, which he illustrates by how it is carried around. A wallet belongs to an individual and there is not a lot of space in it. A briefcase, on the other hand, points to a more public environment. The briefcase can contain much more than the wallet and is usually carried around in professional settings. Larger amounts from informal transactions turn the operation into a business, a main activity that provides a livelihood. Anders did not say if the work he did for the pizzerias was with or without an invoice; just that he was paid in cash. Working too much svart professionally is not acceptable to him. As Anders explains, then you have to have a svart lÃ¥da, literally a black box, somewhere in the firm. A black box makes for a separate economy, where informal incomes and informal expenses are kept. In these instances, there can be talk of an informal economy within a firm, which is separate from the public book-keeping and audits (BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2010, 2013). Although he received snuff money, a large box was something Anders did not seem to want. But he knew very well how such a set-up would work. Andersâs latter explanations underscore the importance of taking a holistic view when we try to understand non-compliance. It is important to recall that reciprocal explanations are part of a larger reasoning. Although reciprocity can be borne in mind in oneâs understanding of how tax money is spent, there is also a simultaneous limit on how much can be justified in withholding tax that ought to be paid."

The assumption is that, if only we knew everything that there is to know, we would act perfectly, or, alternatively, that mistakes and wrong doings could be attributed to a lack of knowledge. This, again, has been challenged by some schools of thought for some time, but is now becoming commonplace. Indeed, we are orphans of the encyclopaedic ideal and subject to the new experience that the binding constraint is not our knowledge, but instead our attention capacity. Information, and even knowledge, is like what used to be a natural resource: plentiful. We have shifted our sense of boundlessness from natural resources (now recognized as finite quantities) to information and knowledge. Indeed, with the digital transition, there are fewer and fewer activities that do not produce a âdigital shadowâ. All the electronic devices we engage with (portable or not) leave a recorded trace: where we are, what we read, what we buy, not to mention the information we post about ourselves on social networks or blogs. Information is akin to natural resources of a third kind, besides the non-renewable and the renewable, we have the exponential. Instead of aiming at a global or encyclopaedic overview, we need to learn to navigate through information-saturated waters, and make sense of and value the abundance of information through datamining and other filtering activities. This radical mental shift has consequences on our behaviours as knowers, in our collective representation of what knowledge and information are, on the link between knowledge and action (consider the veil of ignorance) and also, more concretely, on the framing of the fundamental right to privacy, as the current principles of control and data minimisation on which the privacy framework is built fail to grasp optimally the new societal concerns regarding privacy, reputation and image."

Dashing back and forth, he finally collapses from this identity runaround, because he can never distinguish the âtrueâ hedgehog from the âfalseâ hedgehog. Read for the theater, this fable raises the question of whether actors also experience such an âidentity runaround.â Do actors also rush back and forth without any chance of winning until they drop dead of exhaustion? Is the actor not in a similar fix as the arrogant hare, with the difference being that he himself is at both ends of the course? He is at once both hare and hedgehog, in constant competition with himself. He is, so to speak, his own opponent. He beats himself by fooling himself â because he himself is the site, medium, and intermediary of his play. Because he himself, his whole being from head to toe â his eyes, his nose, his mouth, his ears â depends upon, falls back upon, his own complex existence. But he can never catch sight of himself while he is playing, neither literally nor metaphorically. This must cause a slew of questions to explode in the actor, be they ever so vague. What actually happens to the ego when an actor acts? What about the others? What about the character and his relationship to him, and to the characters of the other actors, as character and as himself? But even more disconcerting, almost alienating, what about his own ego in general? âOh, to be someone else for once! Just for one minute,â yearns Georg BÃ¼chnerâs Leonce.8 Then he would be OK. But does not another contrary desire join this one that expresses itself thus: âJe est un autre.â9 Is the actor not haunted by multiple persons who speak through him and monkey about in the shadows? Among these persons are many whose visors are down. Is the actor then many? Considering all this, who would not fall flat on his face, fall over backwards, fall headlong into disaster like the poor hare? Who is not lost in a labyrinth, in a runaround, because the concepts of the enlightened consciousness, of critical reflection and logical analysis, suddenly no longer help us to take control of the situation?"
253,136,0.947,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Other ethical principles can create dilemmas, too. It is generally uncontroversial that, if you can easily avoid harm to yourself, then you should do it. Indeed, it may be morally required that you save yourself when possible, if your life is intrinsically valuable or worth protecting; and it is at least extrinsically valuable if you had a dependent family. Auto manufacturers or OEMs seem to take this principle for granted as well: if an autonomous car can easily avoid a crash, e.g., by braking or swerving, then it should. No ethical problem hereâor is there? In another thought-experiment [15, 18, 33], your robotic car is stopped at an intersection and waits patiently for the children who are crossing in front of you. Your car detects a pickup truck coming up behind you, about to cause a rear-end collision with you. The crash would likely damage your car to some degree and perhaps cause minor injury to you, such as whiplash, but certainly not death. To avoid this harm, your car is programmed to dash out of the way, if it can do so safely. In this case, your car can easily turn right at the intersection and avoid the rear-end collision. It follows this programming, but in doing so, it clears a path for the truck to continue through the intersection, killing a couple children and seriously injuring others. Was this the correct way to program an autonomous car? In most cases of an impending rear-end collision, probably yes. But in this particular case, the design decision meant saving you from minor injury at the expense of serious injury and death of several children, and this hardly seems to be the right choice. In an important respect, you (or the car) are responsible for their deaths: you (or the car) killed the children by removing an obstruction that prevented harm from falling upon them, just as you would be responsible"

At 18 some of the working-class girls felt attracted to the idea of staying at home for some years while their children are small, but said that it would depend on economy. They reacted positively to the idea of the father staying at home for a period of time, but had not really thought about it, and wondered whether he would be willing to do so. They thought housework âought toâ be shared equally, but were not sure if it would happen. The working-class girl Kine said that the most important is that someone is at home when the child is young and that she âprobably would demand that everything is to be shared equallyâ.

For example, one of my neighbours in the hostel where I resided laid a particular stress on time-keeping: having been a factory shift worker, he was quite a stickler for punctuality. He had invited me to share a meal with him one evening, and we had agreed to meet in the communal kitchen on his floor. I was three (at the most, four) minutes late, but he was evidently quite annoyed to begin with: âwhen I say eight oâclock, I mean eight oâclock!â On another occasion, he told me: When we [immigrants] arrived in these countries in Europe, we followed the European system, a meeting at 3pm, itâs at 3pm on the dot. Back home, a guy might say at 4pm but doesnât show up, even if you go looking for him, heâll say âyes, but I forgotâ â so we have a different mentality from them."

It would have been difficult to put in place any organizational system ahead of time, so this situation can be understood to be the outcome of the government proceeding flexibly to set up a system in accordance to the issues emerging along the way. Regrettably, however, there are too many deliberative bodies, and it is unclear how they all relate to each other. And even with this complicated system, it was not until 2013, approximately two years after the nuclear power plant accident, that the system was finally accelerated to be set up and operational. Considering, for example, that it was late 2011 when TEPCO presented and later withdrew its plan to release treated and purified contaminated water into the sea, as mentioned before, I canât help thinking that if at this point in time a system had been set up to enable TEPCO to work together with the"

For that purpose one needs to start with the simple meanings as a given. Although both of those claims are true, at least as the task is conceived by the Objectivists, they seem also to have forgotten their rationales for finding semantic compositionality attractive in the first place: the arguments from understandability, from productivity, from learnability, and from creativity. Certainly all of these arguments make the claim that the justification of semantic compositionality lies in the way it facilitates mental processing. And thus, even if the picture that âlanguage is about the worldâ is correct, these arguments nevertheless presuppose or require that language also embody features of oneâs mental life. A natural place for the Objectivists to find this missing connection is to claim that the terminal nodes of their meaning structures are given by mental items, such as concepts. And then they can go ahead andâfrom this starting pointâbe entirely compositional. In fact, Iâm sure that most of the philosophers-semanticists who give any thought to the issue probably believe something along those lines. But letâs look at what this would entail. If the psychological results are correctâand they have been replicated over and over, at least in regards to simple binary combinationâthat mental concepts allow both for differences in degree of typicality of the concept and also for differences in degree of membership (Hampton and JÃ¶nsson 2012, pp. 386â87), then this would have to be a feature of the meanings at the terminal nodes of the semantic structure. The lexical item âfurnitureâ, for instance, would have to admit in the world of different degrees of truth (and not merely different degrees of typicality) for âThis chair is furnitureâ and âThis clock is furnitureâ. I think philosophers-semanticists would not countenance this.53 In response to all these competing pressures, I surveyed the prospects for a twotiered semantic theory: one aspect being the Objectivistâs âconnection to the worldâ and the other aspect being the Subjectivistâs account of mental activity. As it turns out, some of the works that claim to provide a two-tier theory actually are within just one of the Subjectivist or Objectivist camp, in that both of their tiers have their foundational starting point, or common nexus, entirely within one camp. I also mentioned a few theories that appear to be genuinely two-tiered, but noted that they require further input, especially from the Subjectivist side of the theory. To agree to anything like the two-tiered theory I outlined, one needs to accept two claims: First, that linguistic utterances are to be judged as to how well they âfitâ the (external) world. One way to put this, and I did, is to say that what is meanto by an utterance concerns the actual world, and not any conceptual representation. The two come apart when 52 Such as John wants to marry a princess, the ambiguity of which (a specific princess versus any"

That was around when I was struggling with my Indian identityâ¦ It was just a huge wake-up callâ. When she went back to India for her grandfatherâs funeral, she watched her grandmother perform religious rituals and rites that she could not do or understand. She felt that she needed to become more practicing and better informed. But although she has since studied and incorporated more elements from India into her identity and practice, it does not mean, she explains, that she has become more India-focused. She realizes that her relationship to India hinges strongly on her grandparentsâ presence there. âSometimes it felt like [India] only existed while I was there. It felt suspended every time I left because I was not physically thereâ. Although she feels more connected now and has greater access and understanding, she worries that her bonds are tenuous. We see Ekata as American-centric, although her account also reveals that she is clearly influenced by people and ideas from other sites and layers of the social field she inhabits. While she has begun to incorporate more Hindu elements into her life, she uses them to construct a religious practice that fits with her lifestyle in the US. The social axes of her religious identity are primarily local, be they friends and family members in Oklahoma, in Vadodara in India, or her classmates in Boston. Regional factors also shape her experience. She grew up in the Midwest surrounded by few other Indian Americans in a place with very little religious diversity. Christianity pervades her world as the normative default category and she often measures herself against her real and imagined experience of it. She also selectively draws on global Indian culture, having been exposed to it through the childrenâs books and videos that circulate widely. Ultimately, however, at least for now, the religious assemblage she creates is primarily about Indian-Americanness."
123,105,0.947,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"In aviation, there has been a quest to move beyond hint and hope, to more direct and unambiguous ways of communication. The Tenerife disaster was a turning point, generating activities to improve feedback quality amongst employees, under the heading of Crew Resource Management (CRM). Gordon, Mendenhall, & OâConnor (2012, p. 59) convey how CRM encourages crew to focus on what is right rather than who is right, and thus draws attention to the matters of fact rather than on opposing views and rivalry amongst colleagues about who has the most appropriate understanding of the situation. Personal prestige can stand in the way of clarification of the situation at hand, since it makes people hold on to their own beliefs, even beyond the point where they have obtained strong reasons to revise them. CRM is all about challenging each other in respectful manners, with a constructive intention. The person who is expressing a concern should be specific about the content, and timely, not hesitating to speak up at the moment when something appears to be wrong. CRM encourages crew to seek information, ask questions and push for clarification of situations that appear ambiguous to them. In order to be effective, the human dimension of a barrier system depends on a wholehearted commitment to these principles of direct and unambiguous speech. Flight engineer Morten Theiste conveys an experience where a pilot he was working with needed a reminder about his commitment to CRM (Theiste, 2017). This pilot had trouble with the autopilot in the aircraft on the second last leg of the day. The device had disconnected several times. Even though the crew could reconnect it, the autopilot continued to disconnect. The pilot was looking forward to a short turnaround in Oslo before his last leg to home base in Copenhagen but he had to report the autopilot problem to technical staff in Oslo. He considered it to be a minor issue, and thought that he could easily fly the aircraft manually home and have the Copenhagen technical staff to look at the autopilot during night stop. âI was called out to meet this crew to check up the matter at the gate after landing. The aircraft had been emptied and was ready for boarding when I came to the gate. The captain explained the problem to me. I said that I needed to go back to the hangar to check the technical manuals about the specific logic behind the autopilot disconnect during the described circumstances. Sometimes an autopilot disconnect may"
308,217,0.947,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Karen Armstrong in her book âA History of Godâ [3] says: In practical terms Islam means that Muslims had a duty to create a just equitable society where the poor and vulnerable are treated decently. The early moral message of the Qurâan is simple: It is wrong to stockpile wealth and build a private fortune, and good to share the wealth of society fairly by giving a regular proportion of oneâs wealth to the poorâ (Holy Qurâan 92/18, 9/103, 63/9, 102/1). Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: âI swear by God, that a person who inflicts harm to his neighbor is not a [full-fledged] believer of Godâ [4]. In another hadith, he said, âA woman entered hellï¬re, because she incarcerated a cat until it died of hunger and thirst [5]â. These two hadiths admonish against maleï¬cence , i.e., doing harm to humans or animals. The following hadith recommended beneï¬cence to a dog: âA prostitute of Bani Israel (Children of Israel) was thirsty, so she came to a well and got water for her to drink. As she ï¬nished, she found a dog very thirsty licking the ground from thirst, so she went back to the well and got him water in her shoes until she quenched his (its) thirst. God was pleased with her and let her into paradise [6]â. AlGhazali said: âIf you cannot reach the level of angels, then do not fall into the level of beasts, scorpions and snakes. If your soul is content to come down from the highest heights, at least do not let it be content into the lowest depths (to the rank of beasts, snakes and scorpions). Perhaps you will be saved by the middle way where you have neither more nor less than what sufï¬cesâ [7], i.e., not doing harm and doing some good. David Humeâs moral psychology and virtue ethics makes motives of benevolence all-important in moral life, and maintains that benevolence is an original feature of human nature. He, like AlGhazali, recognizes egotism and selï¬shness can mask the inherent good in human psyche, and he uses the metaphors of the dove (angel with AlGhazali) wolf (beast) and serpent (snakes and scorpions) to illustrate the mixture of elements in our nature. Hume regards persons as motivated by a variety of passions, both generous and ungenerous, i.e., good and bad [8]. He maintains that these elements vary by degree from person to person. Each person should strive hard to uplift himself from the level of beasts and snakes to the level of doves (peaceful and doing no harm), if he cannot reach the level of angels doing good (as AlGhazali maintains). The Holy Qurâan says: âWe have indeed created man in the best stature, then we abase him to the lowest of the lowâ (Holy Qurâan 95:4â5). Man can be almost like an angel, but he also can be like snakes and scorpions."

But at the same time, the creative event of acting insists on the porosity of his skin; it must be torn open ecstatically, become permeable. In the limelight of the stage, with no cloak of invisibility at hand, ânakedâ â no script in hand, no rostrum to hide behind, without the shield of scientific neutrality and with the pressure of performative quality â the traditional masterâslave relationship of corporeality and intellect is instantly reversed.17 The play can no longer be delivered from the spirits it has called. The body has been turned on; it surges, begins to duplicate itself â and there is no wise sorcerer in sight. He has vanished from the story. The body can only throw its own weight around; the body itself matters and acts on its own authority.18 Usually a slave, a lowly apprentice, the body now takes over the controls. It has no shame and it has low standards. For example, it may act like a lump of clay. No matter how nicely it is talked to, despite all the cajoling, it may remain clumsy and wooden. Suddenly, novice actors have not two, but four arms and legs. What do I do with my hands? Everything becomes a problem. Theyâre suddenly dangling so weirdly like they donât belong to me, alien. Just standing there without immediately putting his hands into his pockets â a favorite gesture of male novice actors â just standing there without looking like he has been bolted to the ground and without bolting, going to stand somewhere else because he just cannot bear it and feels like he has to do something; just standing can become the most difficult of tasks. It may sound hackneyed, but to be on stage, exposed to the eyes of others, and to âbelievablyâ act some daily task naturally, not cramped, not stiff, without clichÃ©s â simply but focused â is a higher art than is commonly believed. Actors experience the paradoxical phenomenon that a dominant will, the usual instrument of autonomous action, is counterproductive to engaging acting. The will gets in the way, literally. It initiates a process of self-observation that censors breathing and imagination. It is the critic who gives grades, the superego that appraises, argues, judges, and passes out sentences. Blocks are preprogrammed, innocence lost. At the same time, the actor depends upon his will. He needs it. Without it he cannot 17 On the transvaluation of the ideal bodyâmind relationship in Nietzscheâs philosophy, see Volker Gerhardt, âDie âgroÃe Vernunftâ des Leibes.

155,358,0.946,New Vision 2050 : a Platinum Society,"It Is Innovation for Being Used at the Site Yoshikawa Perhaps this is whatâs called social engineering. In the case of Japan, even if something is achieved at the level of science or technology, whether or not that achievement gets introduced into society is a separate problem. There is a huge social problem. In that regard, I believe that there is still much room for improvement in Japan. I believe that there is also a large role to be played by the state and the government. For example, a historical example that was successful that I think of, though maybe somewhat out of the blue, is the Dojunkai Apartments. In the recovery after the 1923 Kanto Earthquake, the Home Ministry erected about twenty Dojunkai Apartment buildings in Tokyo and Yokohama. Up until then, collective housing had consisted of wooden buildings with at most two stories; however, the collective housing introduced with the Dojunkai Apartments consisted of concrete structures that were 3 to 4 stories, or, in some cases, even 6â7 stories high. The Dojunkai Apartments served as the model for post-WWII collective housing, and it is clear that they represent the prototype of the modern-day apartment complexes. The Home Ministry played a leading role in carrying out that experimental project. Because âseeing is believing.â it is extremely important to present a model in a form that people can see with their eyes. Especially nowadays, I think itâs even more necessary to make a model. This is true especially in the fields of medicine and caregiving. An easy to understand example would be that even if a caregiver robot were developed, it is not introduced into an actual caregiving facility. It is because they are not a part of the medical treatment fee structure. Aside from the case where there is a unique business manager who wants to experiment with the robot and pays out of his/ her pocket for it, there is no basis for introducing such robots into caregiving facilities. Thus, the state must play a leading role in spreading the use of caregiver robots. People have been talking about this for 10 years now, but it still isnât happening. Even in the field of energy, in which you are interested, there was a certain type of scheme that was created in order to foster the diffusion of renewables. In the same manner, the medical and caregiving fields will more than likely require some sort of public initiative before innovative technologies are adopted for widespread use. I guess this is what is called social innovation. I believe that there is a lot of room for progress there."

387,19,0.946,CHAPTER 5 âRapt Up with Joyâ:,"but I trust thou art going to the embracings of the Lord Jesusâ.82 Maryâs mother seems to have been enjoying vicariously the affectionate embraces that Jesus would soon be giving to her daughter. The image of Christ as a loving, tender father is ubiquitous in accounts of child deaths, and it seems to appear less frequently in those of adults. Arguably the most comforting aspect of heaven was the possibility of family reunion after death.83 In 1620, ten-year-old Cecilia DâEwes contracted smallpox; her mother had died a short time previously, and therefore, the girl appeared not to mind dying, but instead âwould speak of her religious motherâ, crying with relief, âI will go to my mother, I will see her; I shall shortly be with herâ.84 It was common for children to lose one or both of their parents in the early modern period: in Elizabethan Rye, for instance, nearly 60 per cent of the fathers who died left children under the age of fourteen.85 It is therefore not surprising that children looked forward to heavenâthey longed to see their parents. Parents often reminded their offspring of this reunion, so as to comfort them during their last moments. A few hours before her death in 1679, Isaac Archer told his six-year-old daughter Frances, âshe was going to heaven to her brothers and sisters, and that we should all meet againeâ.86 The idyllic image of the reunited family evoked in the above extracts demonstrates the deeply loving nature of many family relationships."
223,106,0.946,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"To the budding geographer the time-bound message could not be misunderstood: Capture the power of social relations in a net of scientific laws and then, like your friends in physics, chemistry, and medicine, you too will have acquired the means not merely for understanding the world but for changing it as well. If the natural scientists know how to construct rockets that take them to the moon, if they know how to generate energy by enriching uranium, if they know how to save lives by transplanting hearts, then your duty as a social scientist is to discover similar techniques for eradicating poverty! Before you accept that challenge, though, be sure to ask yourself first why no one now reads Plato and Aristotle for what they had to say about physics or medicine, then why so many continue to return to the plays of Sophocles and Shakespeare for their insights into the human condition of hopes and fears, love and hate. How does the circumstance that we have accumulated knowledge in some areas and not in others relate to Aristotleâs remark that we should look for precision in each class of things just as far as the nature of the subject admits and that it would be equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician as to demand scientific proofs from a rhetorician? No small order given to a young man inexperienced in the actions that occur in life and therefore prone to pursue each object as passion directs. And yet, how could I possibly have ignored the challenge? GO ON, GO ON. The list of required readings included the classics of location theory, cognitive science, decision theory, systems analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, spatial statistics, and a sprinkle of historical geography, all of it somehow yoked together in Walter Isardâs conception of Regional Science and its extension into Peace Science, the latter firmly anchored in the Quaker-thin interface of scientific knowledge and political action, John Deweyâs pragmatism and the collections of the Barnes Foundation never far away. A formative experience it was, the handsome fellowship that in 1963â1964 took me to North Armorica and the intellectual hubs of the Wharton School, Berkeley, and Northwestern. Great. Yet, in hindsight, the seeds might well have been planted 10 years earlier by the odd gymnasium teacher who did whatever he could to introduce his rowdy pupils to the concentric rings of von ThÃ¼nenâs isolated state and the cost curves of Alfred Weberâs isodapanes. Perhaps I was the only one to pay attention, but the truth is that I can still feel in my body the boyâs excitement when he literally saw why there were so many gauchos on the Pampas and so many steel mills along the Ruhr. The rhetorical power of geometric construction on the high wire, von ThÃ¼nenâs agricultural landscape depicted as an archerâs target with the bullâs eye as the central city on a homogeneous plain (more correctly the Junkerâs own estate), Weberâs factory finding its place of least cost, the Archimedean point that is located at the center of a Euclidean triangle whose corners are the concepts of transportation, labor, and agglomeration.

When he sent out the press release about the manâs supposed arrest, he had been concerned for Raminâs safety. When the intrusion occurred, he came to understand, from one moment to the next, that this was not his friend, this was someone doing him harm. He had difficulty believing that this was really true. But the sense of betrayal described here is not just personal betrayal, it has to be understood in its authoritarian context. As it happens, our Iran researcher grew up in East Germany and thought that his youth had taught him always to be suspicious. Instead, he had been too trustful and forgotten how ugly the intrusion of an authoritarian regime in personal relations can become. Also characteristic of authoritarian circumstances is the lack of clarity, until this day, about the exact nature of the incident. Our researcher filed a complaint with the police, and it became clear that the police was not involvedâthey were furious and considered the incident as a criminal act. Nor does Ramin appear to have been working for the ministry of intelligence: an Iranian lawyer made some informal inquiries and found that there was no file on our researcher. Later it transpired that Ramin had been involved in the arrest of bloggers and journalists; in the following years, he became an editorial writer for the hardline conservative press. But it remains unclear whether, at the time of the incident, he had been connected to any of the various parallel intelligence agencies and whether the incident was just a brazen attempt at extortion, or at least in part a political warning. Without being personally betrayed as our Iran researcher was, others also have the experience of seeing people whom they believed to be idealistic turn into regime apologists. Our Morocco researcher spent quite some time with journalists who used to criticize the regime but now work for pro-government media. She is careful not to judge them: these people were young when she met them and may at some point have decided in favor of having a family and a normal life. The price of being a regime critic can be very high, and we might make the same calculation in their position.

We cannot get the budget for students who donât have an ID or are still in the process of applying so we have to share with them the budget of other students, Thai students and those students who already received their ID numbersâ¦I think maybe the long and complicated procedure and financial problems might be one of the reasons why many public schools donât want to accept migrant students but here we accept all children who applied. The law clearly states that we have to do so.10"

140,208,0.946,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Let me now return to the democratic peace argument. Rudy, like many other scholars, contended that democracies are unlikely to ï¬ght each other. Among democracies, diplomacy replaces bullets. Domestically, the ballot box has the same moderating effects. He argues that if we check power through democratic freedoms we would not have democide (Rummel, 1994: 27). Quoting Lord Acton, Rummel (1994: 19) concludes that âpower kills, and absolute power kills absolutelyâ. This is a categorical statement about a relationship that is in fact probabilistic. A larger theoretical question it raises is why do some totalitarian and authoritarian regimes commit megamurders while others do not? Saudi Arabia, for example, is one of the most authoritarian states in the contemporary world, yet state executions only number in the hundreds. Uzbekistan is a similar example. And on the democratic side, Sri Lanka is one clear case of a democratic regime that in 1989â90 authorized military squads to track down and summarily execute members and suspected supporters of the JVP (Peoples Liberation Party), which had begun its second rebellion that threatened to overthrow the state.

175,187,0.946,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","In our opinion the most important aspect of model use today is communication. Unless water resource planners and managers can articulate well their needs for information, it will be difï¬cult for modelers to generate such information. If the modelers cannot communicate effectively their modeling assumptions and results, or how others can use their tools to obtain their own results, little understanding will be gained from such models. Both users and producers of modeling analyses must work together to improve communication. This takes time, patience, and the willingness to understand what each has to say and what is really meant by what is said. To expect everyone to communicate effectively and to fully understand one another may be asking too much. As written in the Bible (Genesis; Chapter 11, Verses 1â9) there was a time when everyone on the earth was together and spoke one language. It seems these people decided to build a tower âwhose top may reach into the heaven.â Apparently this activity got the attention of the Lord, who for some reason did not like this tower building idea. So, according to the Bible, the Lord came down to earth and âconfounded the peoples language so they could not understand one another.â They could no longer work together to build their tower. Is it any wonder we have to work hard to communicate more effectively with one another, even in our single, but multidisciplinary, ï¬eld of water resources planning and management? Let all of us modelers or analysts, planners, and managers work together to build a new tower of understanding. To do this we need to control our jargon and take the time to listen, communicate, and learn from each other and from all of our experiences. Who knows, if we are successful, we may even have another visit from the Lord. Those who are involved in the development of water resource systems modeling methodology know that the use of these models cannot guarantee development of optimal plans for water resources development and management.

One often has an idea of what one would like to achieve on a particular operation, but there has been no theoretical framework to enable a link to the problem at issue. One approach is to create specific theoretical terms to facilitate analysis of military operations. However, it might also be of value to do what is often done in academic circles, to apply a fresh, untested line of thinking to the material under study. This is the approach that will be adopted in this text, albeit only purely tentatively. This shows that it is far from impossible for terms to be given value without even the definitions of the term itself being defined, it is like a casino where the stakes are being thought over and the winner defines the content of what was at stake. A more reasonable approach is, of course, to define what is being discussed before proceeding with a power struggle over the same subject of discussion. A theoretical perspective will now be presented that gives an alternative perspective to military planning, or it will at least provide an understanding of how an operations area can be analysed using theory. It is worth stressing that this does not necessarily mean presenting a theory that will lead to new practices on the field. Rather it so happens that much of what is advocated by the theory actually already occurs on the field. The problem is that the practices being examined here have hitherto lacked any form of explanatory foundation, other than that proven experience has shown that they work well. If the practices are given a theoretical explanation this may illuminate how current practice can be further developed. Therein lies the benefit of a theory that can be applied to the practices under discussion here. I emphasise this point here, but believe it to be so important that you will find it repeated throughout the text: theories are used mainly to generate issues of interest that will be played out empirically. Theories are not primarily used to provide answers to questions. If the latter were the case empirical research would not be necessary, theory alone would suffice to explain reality. This is an unempirical process that should be avoided. Only in exceptional cases where there is a lack of empirical foundation can one generalise using an empirical approach, and assume that a situation will play out in a certain way. Nonetheless, theory is important in empirical research, as it helps us structure the reality which empirical data consists of. Military intervention in an area where armed conflict is taking place is, to say the least, a risky undertaking. There is a mass of information that"

The second part of Nelsonâs vision took shape in the early 1960s, when there was âa lot of talk around Cambridge about Computer-Assisted Instruction, for which there was a lot of moneyâ according to Literary Machines [9, p. 1/26]. At this point, Nelsonâs project was not so much a design, he stressed when I asked for records once again (I must annoy him with my desire for bits of paper), he said, âit was an idea that may have been on only one file cardâ (Nelson 2011). At this stage he devised what he called âthe thousand theories program,â an explorable computer-assisted instruction program that would allow the user to study different subjects by taking different trajectories through a network of information. In Literary Machines he writes, âThis idea rather quickly became what I would eventually call hypertextâ [9, p. 1/26]. He thought of the system as incorporating many separate, modularized paragraphs, each with branching choices: writing as a graph, not a single line or sequence. This led to another idea, which Nelson drafted as an academic paper while teaching sociology at Vassar College in 1965. That would become the transclusive relationshipâand eventually ZigZag. It also got him published for the first time, which is why historians like to use that date. In his 1965 paper for the ACM, âA File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminateâ [5], Nelson proposed a display-based computer system that permitted linking between documents and the re-use of elements called Zippered Lists. Again, this was at a time when the whole idea of text on a screen was seen as a waste of processing power, let alone bizarre ânonsequentialâ text. In 1965, unless you were working on Doug Engelbartâs team or could afford a system with video-type display (Nelson reasons it âwould cost less than a secretaryâ in his paper, at $37,000 in 1965 money, which would be a well-paid secretary), computers were expensive things with more important jobs to do. For most organisations they still didnât have screens. I should also stress that, in 1965, text was not dataâit was something academics and journalists manipulated with typewriters. As Doug Engelbart told me in 1999, the whole concept of a human being sitting in an interactive feedback loop with a computer, manipulating symbols on a screen, was foreign to most people in the 1960s. It was wacky even in the seventies, when we had it workingâreal hypermedia, real groupware working. (Engelbart 1999, personal communication)"

How much the families use this opportunity varies. In one Danish municipality, only 56% of students attended their local schools; while in Norwegian municipalities, more than 90% of students attended their local schools. In Norway, the main motivation for selecting a nonproï¬t school are the special services they offer. For the religion-based nonproï¬t schools, the view of this parent is typical: âThe Christian influence and the values we have, they get them both at school and at home; the values we have, they get them at school alsoâ (Interview, parent, nonproï¬t school, Norway). The other schools, which have alternative approaches to teaching as their basis, point to their holistic approach to each student and relaxed approach to testing and competition as examples of their special qualities. At the same time, there was a large minority of families whose choices were not determined by the schoolsâ conceptual framework. Rather, they actively make a choice away from the public schools. These families shared a negative experience with the public schools, and approached nonproï¬t schools as a last resort. One mother gives a telling example about her daughter: She has had some difï¬culty concentrating throughout her schooling. As parents, we have seen it, but the school has not taken it seriously and handled it as we wanted. In the end, the girl practically perished. It was a matter of surviving.

Arising indirectly from my work on male mental health and this book, I was invited to co-organise a theme on mental health for Exeter Universityâs âGrand Challengesâ â a new and exciting week-long interdisciplinary initiative offered to first-year undergraduates, which allows them to explore real-world challenges and work with experts in the field. Male mental health formed one important aspect of this initiative. As a direct result of this initiative, the University of Exeter signed a university-wide Time to Change Organisational Pledge in December 2014, making a serious commitment to eliminate stigma and discrimination against staff and students with mental health problems. This commitment was testimony to the energy and enthusiasm of the students and staff involved in the Grand Challenges. Sincere thanks must go to James Wooldridge, Mark Blackmore and Libby Peppiatt from Time to Change, and to a host of individuals at the university who made this possible: Janice Kay, Kate Lindsell, Sarah Johnson, Liz Murphy, Mark Sawyer and Kate Hawkins. I am also grateful to Alastair Campbell, Director of Communications and Strategy to former Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2001â2003, for travelling to the university to deliver a plenary lecture on mental illness, drawing on his own personal experience of alcoholism and psychological breakdown. Finally, it is perhaps ironic that the research questions that underpin this book emerged from an earlier project on neurosis and housewives in 1950s Britain. I was struck by the regularity with which the women who were interviewed for that research expressed concern about the ways in which their husbands and other male relatives had struggled to deal with the pressures of work and family life. Repeatedly, I learned how these men often âdrank too muchâ, or became unwell with mysterious physical and psychosomatic illnesses â and yet found it difficult to express emotion or seek help for their problems. I duly became convinced that there were serious questions we should be asking about male mental health and the common perception that women are more likely to develop psychological illness. Although as women we might argue that there are still many hurdles to overcome until we gain equality with men, as this project developed I soon learned that there are also myriad inequalities faced by men, largely in the arena of health. While this book was under construction during 2014, an article appeared in the Guardian online by the columnist Ally Fogg, entitled âBritainâs male suicide rate is a national tragedyâ (20 February 2014).

124,265,0.946,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"2.1 Speech Acts Versus Acts of Speech An act of speech is simply an act of uttering a word, phrase or sentence. One performs acts of speech while testing a microphone or rehearsing lines for a play. By contrast âspeech actâ is a quasi-technical term referring to any act that can be performed by saying that one is doing so (Green 2013a). Promising, asserting, commanding and excommunicating are all speech acts; insulting, convincing, and winning are not. One can perform an act of speech without performing a speech act. One can also perform a speech act without performing an act of speech: imagine a society in which a marriage vow is taken by virtue of one person silently walking in three circles around another. Similarly, among Japanese gangsters known as Yakuza, cutting off a finger in front of a superior is a way of apologizing for an infraction. A sufficiently stoic gangster can issue an apology in this manner without making a sound. Also, speech acts can be performed by saying that one is doing so, but need not be. One can assert that the window is open by saying, âI assert that the window is open.â But one also can simply say, âThe window is open,â and if one does so with the appropriate intentions and in the right context, one has still made an assertion.1 Another feature distinguishing speech acts from acts of speech is that the former may be retracted but the latter may not be. I can take back an assertion, threat, promise, or conjecture, but I cannot take back an act of speech (Green 2013b). Of course, I cannot on Wednesday change the fact that on Tuesday I made a certain claim, promise, or threat. However, on Wednesday I can retract Tuesdayâs claim with the result that I am no longer at risk of having been shown wrong, and no longer obliged to answer such challenges as, âHow do you know?â This pattern recurs with other speech acts such as compliments, threats, warnings, questions, and objections. By contrast, with speech acts whose original felicitousness required uptake on the part of an addressee, subsequent retraction mandates that addresseeâs cooperation. I cannot retract a bet with the house without the houseâs cooperation, and I cannot take back a promise to Mary without her releasing me from the obligation that the promise incurred. 1 Failure to keep in view a distinction between speech acts and acts of speech can lead to mischief.

The ten capabilities on her list should guide policies in each country, but it is the responsibility of each country to set an adequate threshold. Unfortunately, Nussbaum is rather vague and only arbitrarily discusses certain capabilities and their possible thresholds. In her view, for some capabilities, the threshold should be set in a way that leads to equality so that each human is basically entitled to the same level in that capability (e.g., liberal rights), while for other capabilities the threshold can be set lower and hence allows a certain degree of inequality (e.g., in housing and material living conditions). To her, granting each human each capability above this threshold level is a partial and minimal requirement of what justice demands, admitting that there are various ways a just society can deal with inequalities above the threshold. However, they have to be arranged in a way so that equal respect and concern are guaranteed for all citizens. According to Nussbaum, this implies that each and every capability must be secured up to a certain level and that they should never be assessed from a trade-off perspective: [ ... ] all ten of these plural and diverse ends are minimum requirements of justice, at least up to the threshold level. In other words, the theory does not countenance intuitionistic balancing or trade-offs among them. The constitutional structure (once they are put into a constitution or some other similar set of basic understandings) demands that they all be secured to each and every citizen, up to some appropriate threshold level. In desperate circumstances, it may not be possible for a nation to secure them all up to the threshold level, but then it becomes a purely practical question what to do next, not a question of justice. (Nussbaum 2006, 175) How can we, how should we interpret NussbaumÂ´s rule of sufficiency in regard to children in rich countries? She does not give a clear answer; it often seems as if she views the capability approach as mainly concerned with poverty in poor countries and the severe harm there. We wish to specify some important aspects. (1) In rich countries, a higher level of well-being and well-becoming is obviously achieved for many children; the possibilities to realize a good life are much better than in most other countries in this world. Still, certainly not all children achieve the same level of well-being and well-becoming, and some even fall short of what justice demands in terms of minimal thresholds in these countries. Furthermore, we"

Neither evidentialists nor reliabilists have been very explicit about this formal side. Conee and Feldman, when referring to the relation, speak about âfittingnessâ: a belief in a proposition is justified for a particular person if and only if that belief fits the personâs evidence.24 They explicitly refrain from describing the fitting relation in formal detail, presumably because they want to keep their analysis as general a possible. Reliabilists, of course, are not particularly interested in the formal side of the justification relation either, since they consider it inessential to the actual process of acquiring a justified belief. In contrast to both groups, we deem it fruitful to investigate the formal structure of the justification relation. As we will see, this will enable us to reconstruct the evidentialist and the reliabilist view as two interpretations of one and the same formal framework."
383,56,0.946,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"Motivating question. Let us assume we have a stakeholder who is deciding if and how to invest her money into a stock to maximise her profit, Y . We know that risk and uncertainty are present. At our disposal, we have some simple data that we can use. How can we incorporate our risk and uncertainty thinking into a formal model of the variable Y ? In other words, how can we estimate those probabilities pi in Equation 1.1? Throughout the examples, we showed that a risk analyst needs the following three kinds of skills: technical skills, skills in applying knowledge about human cognition, and communication skills. In the next, we discuss technical skills. We need probability, which is a mathematical sub-discipline devoted to understanding random phenomena. It is one of the pillars of statistical (classical or Bayesian statistics) and non-statistical decision-making tools. We use probability throughout this book. We need statistics, which is a discipline on extracting knowledge from data and from the provided information. There are three pillars: study design, understanding the properties of statistical methods, and data analysis (inference or prediction, i.e., classification, discrimination). There are two main streams of statistics: frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics. And there are further related areas: data science Machine Learning, and artificial intelligence. Often there may be two or more statistical methods appearing suitable for the problem at hand; however, some will be useful and some incorrect to use. Hence we need to develop a critical eye: we keep learning the new statistical methods, keep up to date on what new methods are developed, what is the current understanding of the limitations of the classical methods we always check assumptions of the statistical method. We need computing skills. We need computing skills for several reasons. Firstly, we need to process the data, so we use statistical packages like R, STATA, SPSS, Minitab, etc. Second, there is no statistical theory to help us to do estimation, we need to resort to computer simulations. Third, following a quantification of risk we would want to perform sensitivity analyses. The risk quantification evaluates the degree of knowledge or confidence in the calculated numerical risk results. The sensitivity analysis indicates what input changes are the analysis results most sensitive to. Monte Carlo computer simulation methods are generally used to perform sensitivity analysis."
78,44,0.946,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"4. Though we cannot deny that this attempt has yielded unprecedented results, we must also acknowledge that at some point the processed information must be reintegrated in what Stiegler (pace Husserl) has called our own primary retention (individual memory), to acquire meaning and to be part of our lifeworld (Stiegler 2013). 5. It is important, then, to note that the computational era is rooted in the most extreme type of dichotomous thinking: that of constructing discrete, machine readable bits. To be human, here, means to remember that life is continuous and plural and experienced rather than calculated. 6. The second problem with a dichotomy is that it assumes jointly exhaustive alternatives, which entails that the pairs forming the dichotomy cover all there is to be said about whatever they aim to describe. In his pivotal âThe duality of risk assessmentâ, Ciborra (2004) has elucidated how the hidden presumption that e.g. a risk analysis exhaustively describes a developing reality endangers the resilience of whoever depends on that analysis to remain safe. 7. Smart Grids, policing, medical treatment or the food industry should never assume that the data derivatives that inform their risk analyses cover all that is relevant. To prevent the kind of havoc that plagues our financial system we must instead keep an open mind, assuming that the computational decision systems that feed such critical infrastructure are as biased and fallible as any smart system necessarily must be. To be human, here, means to admit such fallibility as core to the wondrous fragility of life. 8. An interesting example of a dichotomy that confuses instead of clarifies what it means to be human in the computational era, is the dualism that pervades the domain of the philosophy of mind. The cartesian idea of a separate res extensa and a separate res cogitans that together describe reality has given rise to a series of interrelated problems that still haunt much of our understanding of e.g. responsibility and accountability in a world of distributed causation. To overcome the confusion that results from this kind of dualism I believe that we should not merely turn to overlapping instead of mutually exclusive dual pairs, but take leave of the idea that reality should necessarily be described in pairs altogether. 9. Whether it makes sense to think in pairs or in other types of distinctions should depend on the context and the aim of our thinking, not on a propensity to keep things simple. I would, therefore, rearticulate the heading and speak of: Beyond dualities. Long live plurality.

346,221,0.946,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","CONCLUSION Concluding these brief notes on situations when historical education turns into parrhesia, I think that it is important to pay attention to the differences between emotional reactions of participants described in the study that we used as an example of this field of research (Leone and Sarrica 2014). I propose that, all results taken together, clearer information provided in the parrhesia condition allowed participants to better regulate their emotional reactions (frijda 1986), especially their selfconscious or moral emotions (Lewis 2008). The exemplum given in the research described in this chapter shows how these emotions may be seen not only as a barrier (Bar-Tal and Halperin 2013) yet, if well regulated, as a motivational resource (frijda 1986) to get to know a formerly hidden aspect of oneâs own historical past. Of course, not all historical sensitive issues require a parrhesiastic narrative, but those breaking a long-lasting social denial of past in-group faults. Only in this last case, in fact, psychological processes linked to first emotional reactions become crucial, since there is not a consolidated and widespread historical culture framing this knowledge, silenced since teacherâs intervention. In such a situation, literal social denial (Cohen 2001) on past moral indignities of the group produces a lack of historical knowledge that makes parrhesiastic teaching a risky yet unavoidable communication move, since there is a need to break a social silence"

She found that many of her interviewees happily contacted her via social media in the knowledge that there might be surveillance. Our attitudes change when we get concrete indications that, rather than just being absorbed into general surveillance and censorship practices, we are specifically being targeted by security agents. Our Morocco researcher is certain that she was under electronic surveillance during one particular fieldwork period. Returning to her hotel after an interview, she opened her laptop and saw that her Google mail account had been accessed while she was out. She also received phishing e-mails that would appear to fit with what Moroccan activists and journalists have reported (Privacy International 2015). She has not had indications of electronic surveillance on subsequent field trips, but she is convinced that her phone is tapped when she is in Morocco and is careful about what she says on the phone. It took her time to come to terms with this. By repeating to herself that the people undertaking the surveillance were only doing their job, as she was doing hers, she regained her peace of mind. The electronic surveillance episode to her mind has validated her approach of taking handwritten notes rather than recording interviews (see ch.6). Our Malaysia researcher does not have similarly definitive evidence, but both activists and ordinary Malaysians have told him that they assumed the authorities were reading his e-mail and WhatsApp messages during his field research. The activists he interviewed were fairly certain that they were being monitored: after they had agreed via WhatsApp to meet each other at a particular coffee house, special branch people would typically be seen at the coffee house at the appointed time. Initially our researcher was shocked to hear this and very cautious in his questioning. On reflection, however, he decided that if asked during an interview what he was doing, he would stick to our policy of openness and not lie but simply explain that he was conducting an interview. His respondents did not appear particularly intimidated, and for himself, he later thought, eviction was the worst thing that was likely to happen. One of the Mexico researcherâs respondents similarly told him during an interview that phone conversations were tapped, and it was likely that security agents knew that the interview was taking place. As we will detail below, they had much more reason to be afraid than their Malaysian counterparts. Our Iran researcher similarly suspects that when"
253,142,0.946,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","But programming is only one of many areas to reflect upon as society begins to adopt autonomous driving technologies. Assigning legal and moral responsibility for crashes is a popular topic already [1, 14, 20, 22, 49, 51]. Here are a few others, as part of a much longer list of possible questions: Does it matter to ethics if a car is publicly owned, for instance, a city bus or ï¬re truck? The owner of a robot car may reasonably expect that its property âowes allegianceâ to the owner and should value his or her life more than anonymous pedestrians and drivers. But a publicly owned automated vehicle might not have that obligation, and this can change moral calculations. Even for privately owned autonomous vehicles, the occupants arguably should bear more or all of the risk, since they are the ones introducing the machine into public spaces in the ï¬rst place. Do robot cars present an existential threat to the insurance industry? Some believe that ultra-safe cars that can avoid most or all accidents will mean that many insurance companies will go bankrupt, since there would be no or very little risk to insure against [40, 52]. But things could go the other way too: We could see mega-accidents as cars are networked together and vulnerable to wireless hackingâsomething like the stock marketâs âflash crashâ in 2010 [5]. What can the insurance industry do to protect itself while not getting in the way of the technology, which holds immense beneï¬ts? How susceptible would robot cars be to hacking? So far, just about every computing device we have created has been hacked. If authorities and owners (e.g., rental car company) are able to remotely take control of a carâwhich is reportedly under development for law enforcement in the European Union [50]âthis offers an easy path for cyber-carjackers. If under attack, whether a hijacking or ordinary break-in, what should the car do: speed away, alert the police, remain at the crime scene to preserve evidence, or maybe defend itself? For a future suite of in-car apps, as well as sensors and persistent GPS/tracking, can we safeguard personal information, or do we resign ourselves to a world with disappearing privacy rights [27]? To the extent that online services bring online advertising, we could see new, insidious advertising schemes that may allow third-party advertisers to have some influence on the autonomous carâs route selection, e.g., steering the car past their businesses [32]. What kinds of abuse might we see with autonomous cars? If the cars drive too conservatively, they may become a trafï¬c hazard or trigger road-rage in human drivers with"

Although he was not the first to build it, he predicted that hypertext would have domestic penetration before anyone else. Nelson had a rich vision for what Xanadu should look like and the experience it should deliver to the public. The design went through many iterations, which are best explained in Literary Machines. They varied in their details, but all contained intercomparison or the re-use of elements (later dubbed transclusion) in some form. Iâll talk about how these ideas evolved briefly here. The vision started in 1960, and Nelson tends to get cranky at me when I begin in 1965 because that is the first published record (historians like bits of paper published at the time in addition to human memory). The designs, he told me in 2011, âhad been swirling in my head for 5 yearsâ before then (Nelson 2011, pers. comm.). I will be starting in 1960 today, but I want to stress that this is based on Nelsonâs recollections in Literary Machines, on his autobiography Possiplex, and on our personal interviews. Iâd love to go through Nelsonâs archives and find a term paper or file card from 1961. Nelson has shown me tantalizing video footage of a box of file cards from the 1960s. Thatâs like watching porno for a media historian. According to Literary Machines (and his autobiography), Nelson did a term writing project for the IBM 7090 in 1960. The IBM, the only computer at Harvard at the time, was stored in a big, air-conditioned room at the Smithsonian Observatory [9, p. 1/25]. That setup would have cost over two million dollars back then, and it wouldnât have had a screen. Nelson believes he saw a screen in a manual at one point â as he told me in an email a couple of weeks ago, âI remember it very clearly. A round CRT and a flat desk surface, a light penâ (Nelson 2014, pers. comm.). This was apparently not Ivan Sutherlandâs Sketchpad, which was built in 1963, and Nelson has been unable to find the image again in the IBM 7090 manual). In Possiplex, he writes: A few words, a few pictures of people at computer screens, and the understanding that computer prices would fallâthese gave me all I needed to know, a crystal seed from which to conjure a whole universe [10, p. 100]."
152,213,0.946,interdisciplinary Perspectives On Mortality and Its Timings : When Is Death?,"againâ is roughly the standard for what has been called âhigher brain death,â the death of the brain where memory, reasoning, and consciousness reside. So higher brain death might mean ânever to be conscious againâ or ânever to have what is taken to be the essence of a human beingâ, or ânever to recover what had given someone their identityâ. In these cases, there is no question that the person is dead by any historically defensible category, but rather that she is in such a state that she is already socially and culturally dead and that therefore the living are justified in stopping measures which keep her biologically alive, that is, enteral nutrition and perhaps some assistance in breathing. Of course, we often stop these treatments, assuming for a moment that we consider providing food and air treatments, along with othersâantibiotics, vaso suppressors, specific therapiesâwhen death in its old-fashioned sense is taken to be imminent and all interventions hopeless. âPulling the plugâ, that is, removing the most critical interventionâthe ventilatorâis the main way of allowing death to enter. But this is another matter. The machinery of the intensive care unit has made biological death comport more closely with various conceptions of death as understood culturally even if âreally deadâ means what it has always meant. If the decision is taken that someone is ânever to have the essence of being human againâ, then the removal of technological life support can translate that decision into biological reality. But technology has done little to alter the rhythms of becoming dead in a broader cultural sense except, perhaps, to expand the lives of the dead among the living. They speak, as they always have, before and after, at the end of Shakespeareâs plays and in many other instances, sometimes as ghosts, but often not. âHe being dead yet speaketh,â St. Paul said of Abel, slain by his brother Cain. By his faith he speaks from the grave. We are about to read âthe work of a dead man,â announces the nineteenth-century Brazilian narrator in the prologue of The Posthumous Memoirs of BrÃ¡s Cubas by his compatriot, the novelist Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. Just to clarify, he wants to make readers aware of the âradical difference between [his] book and the Pentateuch:â Moses waited until the end to speak of the circumstances of his death; our author gives it away at the start. And lest we still miss the point: âI am not exactly a writer who is dead but a dead man who is a writer, for whom the grave was a second cradleâ. âI expiredâ he continues, âat two oâclock on Friday afternoon in the month of August, 1869, at my beautiful suburban place in"
46,29,0.946,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"valuable achievements that must be considered for evaluating a personâs situation comprehensively. If not, it might get overlooked that a good choice with respect to one domain was â all things considered â a tough or even tragic one. Since capabilities are a kind of freedom, it also becomes clear that the approach gives a high value to peopleâs agency, which is, according to Sen, understood as the faculty to act and bring about change according to oneâs values and objectives (Sen 1999b, 19). In the end, people should be able to identify with their choices and actively shape their own lives; it is therefore decisive for a just society to provide the conditions to make this, in fact, possible. It is crucial to understand that the notion of well-being as it is used in the capability approach must not be identified with what is typically termed âwelfareâ in political philosophy or economics, where the term is understood exclusively in relation to individual preferences or happiness. As shown, this position was powerfully rejected by Sen. Or to put it differently, the notions of well-being, on the one hand, and functionings and capabilities, on the other, are closely related, and there is by now a vast literature confirming this diagnosis (Comim, Qizilbash and Alkire 2008; Deneulin and Shahani 2009; Biggeri, Ballet and Comim 2011). Welfare, on the other hand, in Senâs terminology, is only one aspect of the overall well-being of a person and must not be reduced to it. A personâs capabilities (but also achieved functionings) depend on many different factors. They are a product of a personâs abilities and skills, as well as the political, social and economic context she finds herself in. They obviously usually depend on resources; without the necessary goods, it is simply not possible to live a self-determined life according to oneâs own conception of the good. However, what matters is the ârelationship between persons and goodsâ (Sen 1980, 216) and what the relationship allows us to do and be. In this context, the term âconversion factorsâ is helpful. It was introduced by Sen to conceptualize the relation between resources and the realization of certain functionings, and it calls attention to the degree a person in fact can use the goods at her disposal for her purposes. At least three different kinds of such factors can be identified, all of which have to be taken into account when evaluating the real freedoms somebody has access to (Sen 1992, 19â21; Sen 1999b, 70â72; Robeyns 2005, 98â100). First, there are personal conversion factors. Our physical, psychological and emotional characteristics, as well as our achieved levels of skills, influence what we can âgetâ out of the resources we command. If we are in good health, for example, we do not need a lot to achieve basic mobility. However, due to illnesses or impairments, moving around can"

Of course, the logic of desire and intention is very different from that of belief. Agents can both intend to do something and believe that their intended action will have a certain effect without eo ipso desiring and intending to produce that effect. One can reject an offer and believe that one will irritate the agent of that offer without desiring and intending to provoke such an attitude. There is sometimes a conflict between the intentions and beliefs of an agent at a moment. Certain possible denotation assignments to senses compatible with the execution of the agentâs intentions at a moment are not compatible with the truth of his or her beliefs at that moment. For unwanted effects of the intended action do not occur according to the first assignments. Agents know that some of their beliefs could be false. This can even occur when they believe that it is settled or even inevitable that their action will have a certain unwanted consequence. Bratman and Searle have given a lot of convincing examples. A prior intention to do something P and a belief that it is then necessary that if P then Q do not commit the agent to a prior intention to do Q. We know that we can wrongly believe that certain facts are inevitable. We would then be happier if such facts would not occur. So Kantâs principle: âWhoever intends to achieve an end thereby will the necessary means or effects that he or she knows to be part of the achievement of that endâ does not apply to prior intentions. However because agents are rational they have to minimally coordinate their cognitive and volitive states in trying to act in the world. So a restricted form of Kantâs principle âAny agent who wills the end is committed to willing the necessary meansâ applies to attempts which are intentions in action. In case the agent of an attempt knows that in order to succeed he or she has to do something else, that agent will try to do that other thing. In other words, whoever attempts to achieve an end attempts to use means that he or she knows to be necessary. Such a restricted Kantian principle is valid in my logic of action. When P and Q â ÏPresent Intention (a, m) and the agent a knows at moment m that (P â Q), if P â Goal am then Q â Goal am . Let me give an example. Any agent knows that in order to invite someone one has to make a request. Thus whoever tries to make an invitation eo ipso tries to make a request. His or her attempted request then constitutes his or her attempted invitation. As Goldman pointed out, certain action tokens generate others causally, conventionally, simply and by extension. My logic of action explicates the various forms of action generation. It can also characterize how illocutions which are the primary units of meaning and communication in the use of language relate to other speech-acts (acts of utterance, propositional acts, attempts at performing illocutions, and perlocutionary acts). Attempts at performing illocutions are new fundamental speech-acts in my taxonomy. They are constitutive of meaning. Speakers attempt to publicly perform illocutions by emitting signs. It remains to explicate how and under what conditions they succeed and how successful illocutions generate others (invitations contain requests) and have perlocutionary effects (the hearer is sometimes influenced). At the basis of communication, agents attempt to move parts of their body and this generates in the sense of Goldman in various ways their speech-acts. Generation in communication is first physically causal (we orally utter sentences in producing"

One semester there was a controversy over an allegation by a student that someone from the Dean of Students Office had searched his room in his absence. Although the allegation was public, the Dean of Students wasnât able to comment on the case, so we never found out what really happened. I wrote this problem to tease a friend of mine, who was the Dean of Student Housing. The following synchronization constraints apply to students and the Dean of Students: 1. Any number of students can be in a room at the same time. 2. The Dean of Students can only enter a room if there are no students in the room (to conduct a search) or if there are more than 50 students in the room (to break up the party). 3. While the Dean of Students is in the room, no additional students may enter, but students may leave. 4. The Dean of Students may not leave the room until all students have left. 5. There is only one Dean of Students, so you do not have to enforce exclusion among multiple deans. Puzzle: write synchronization code for students and for the Dean of Students that enforces all of these constraints."
305,232,0.946,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"numerous applications. They are so commonly needed that they are programmed into most scientific calculators. We wonât discuss them here apart from mentioning that the number of steps required to solve a system of n equations can be bounded above by a quadratic expression involving n. We say the system can be solved in quadratic time. The other question that we need to address is this: How many times do we need to run the quantum circuit? As we pointed out, in the worst-case scenario, we can keep running our qubits through the circuit and never get any useful information. However, this is extremely unlikely. We examine this idea in more detail in the next section. Complexity Classes In complexity theory, the main classification is between problems that take polynomial time to solve and those that need more than polynomial time. Polynomial time algorithms are regarded as being practical even for very large values of n, but non-polynomial time algorithms are regarded as being infeasible for large n. Problems that classical algorithms can solve in polynomial time are denoted by P. Problems that quantum algorithms can solve in polynomial time are denoted by QP (sometimes it is denoted by EQP, for exact quantum polynomial time). Usually when we use these terms we are referring to the number of steps that an algorithm takes, but, remember, we defined a new way of measuring complexityâquery complexityâthat counts the number of questions we need to ask an oracle. We saw that the Deutsch-Jozsa problem was not in the class P, but belonged to QP for query complexity. (The constant function is a degree 0 polynomial.) This is sometimes described as saying that the Deutsch-Jozsa problem separates P and QPâit is a problem that belongs to QP but not to P for query complexity. However, letâs recall the worst-case scenario for the classical algorithm. To make things more concrete, we will take n = 10. We are given a function that takes 10 inputs and told that it is either balanced or constant. We have to keep evaluating our function on specific inputs until we can deduce the answer. There are 210 = 1024 possible inputs. The worst-case scenario is when the function is balanced, but we get the same answer for the first 512 evaluations, and then on the 513th evaluation we get the other value. But how likely is this to happen?"

So itâs good to work with them beforehand on a potential return home. (...) But frankly, Iâve never seen a single person accept this willingly (...) Really the ones who accept to return, itâs when they know they are going to die soon, because they are so completely dependent, that is to say, instead of going into a retirement home all alone when you have family back home, they reflect all the same on the possibility of returning to the family home, and having their wife or children look after them."

But I was wrong; all my subtle attempts to engage her in conversation about the political situation of her city failed despite the fact that we met frequently over a period of almost three years. By offering me only monosyllabic answers she clearly indicated her desire to change the topic and talk about more light-hearted things such as parties, shopping, holiday plans and so on. When once she passed by a photograph exhibition in the Bosniak-dominated university showing images of a heavily destroyed Mostar, I was sure she would be moved to share her thoughts about Mostarâs recent past with me. However, she only said three words: âThat is horrible!â As shown, the discursive tactics of those who experienced the war as children included strong elements of silencing and distancing the effects the war may have had on their lives. Similar observations were made by Kolind (2008) in Stolac, a town in Herzegovina, where young people also tended to avoid the war in conversations. While those belonging to older generations sometimes expressed the wish to forget about war atrocities that they themselves or their nation had experienced, the war and its aftermath crept into almost every longer conversation. This was particularly true for those who experienced great loss (of family members, property, social and economic status and so on) during the war and did not think that it had changed anything for the better. Instead, they narrated the war as a âsenseless historical dramaâ, as Skultans (1997: 767) termed it in the case of Latvian victim narratives. Often, personal experiences were subordinated within the dominant national discourse of victimisation. Though individuals tend to embed their personal memories into wider officially accepted narratives, one is also likely to encounter dissonance between stories of individual experience and their larger social and historical context. By analysing life stories of Israeli male veterans, Lomsky-Feder (2004) shows how her interlocutors narrated their lives as not affected by the war. Similarly to the Post-Yugoslavs they thereby separated their personal memories from wider societal experiences. But different to the Post-Yugoslavs, Lomsky-Federâs war veterans described their generation as traumatised, while excluding themselves from this experience. LomskyFeder traces this distancing back to the veteransâ feelings of inferiority due to the fact that her interviewees did not take part in key battles. Not"
116,59,0.946,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"In the discussion and analysis of a particular dilemma, the focus can be on all six of the dimensions addressed in the Navigation Wheel, or it can be on the tension between the answers we receive to two or more of the questions. The decision-maker can face a choice of giving primacy of economy (here we have a potentially profitable business option) or identity (it is not really us to act that way). The dilemma can be to prioritize between ethics (according to the principle of equality we can do this) and reputation (it may nevertheless harm our public image), or between law (it is illegal) and morality (I believe it is the right thing to do), and so on. The main purpose of the Navigation Wheel is to assist the decisionmaker in his or her efforts to analyse the available options and keep track of the relevant dimensions of the situation. Is a person who has participated in ethics training and become familiar with the Navigation Wheel better equipped to deal with moral dilemmas and work, and less likely to engage in serious moral wrongdoing? Organizations who hire me to conduct ethical training obviously hope so, but I think there are limitations to what we can achieve simply by making people familiar with tools of ethical analysis. If all it took to establish responsible conduct in organizations was ethical tools, this book could have ended here, with the presentation of the Navigation Wheel as the final analytic device to apply when facing moral dilemmas. Instead, it continues, to attend to how even people with excellent analytic skills, well trained in the use of the three versions of the categorical imperative and in other ethical principles, can become involved in moral wrongdoing at work. Even the ancient idea that tough moral decisions can be safely left to people of particularly strong and stable moral character, will come under critical scrutiny in the remaining chapters."

Finally, the pro-action response is one where the decision-makers go beyond industry norms and expectations, and shows innovation in coming up with unexpected and brilliant solutions to the challenges at hand. Even Carrollâs responsiveness model offers input to Hjalti and the decision he faces. He can choose reaction, and claim that it is not his responsibility as a business owner to uphold activities in remote parts of Iceland. It is the politicians and the local and national authorities who should address that issue. Hjalti can go for defence, and become minimally engaged in what happens in the local communities once his plants are closed down, or he can involve experts in an accommodation effort to identify how a company like his can contribute to social development in remote communities in Iceland, following their advice. Finally, he can choose pro-action, and explore ways to generate activities in those communities, making them less dependent on the fishing traditions of old. He can offer the fishing plant facilities for free or for a very low price to entrepreneurs and innovators who can generate other kinds on employment in the communities. He can collaborate with education providers, who can help his employees to identify and pursue alternative careers. All may not be bleak, even though the employment in fishing disappears. It is worth noting that one of the alternatives that Hjalti considers, of selling the company and leaving the dirty work of closing down the plant to others, is another course of action where utilitarianism and duty ethics will offer conflicting advice to the decision-maker. The utilitarian focuses on the outcome of the alternatives, and since they in all relevant senses appear to be the same, it would not be better, or less worse, for Hjalti to sell and leave the unpopular decision to others. Whether he directly or only indirectly causes this painful outcome for the local community, is morally irrelevant from a utilitarian perspective. An evaluation from a duty ethics perspective, on the other hand, can claim that there is a morally relevant difference between what a person does, and what he or she merely lets happen. We are primarily responsible for what we decide actively to do, and not so much for what we are passive witnesses to, even though we may have been in a position to stop that from happening. Duty ethics also gives emphasis to intention, and as noted in Chapter 3, the Doctrine of Double Effect distinguishes between intended outcomes and outcomes that are merely foreseen DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0009"

In oneâs dealings with other humans, it does not matter whether one is a woman from rural Nigeria and another a male from the capital of Sweden, with extraordinarily different life purposes. What matters is that the moral decision can be universalised across all human beings. For instance, since rational nature is an end in itself, in other words an entity with absolute inner worth, it is universalisable to prohibit the murder of humans. âDo not killâ is therefore a universalisable moral precept. A woman from rural Nigeria cannot be stoned to death if she has committed adultery, and a man from Stockholm cannot be killed even if his liver would save the life of the pope. This leads to powerful demands, eloquently formulated by Allen Wood: The demand that we treat every human being with equal dignity would challenge most ideas, in most cultures, about how people ought to regard one another. â¦ Human dignity is in this way very dangerous in that it threatens to undermine all traditional ways of life in all cultures.

147,4,0.946,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"This description of bushwhacking is the Australian version of trailblazing, and metaphorically, entrepreneurs can also be trailblazersâmake a path through new or unsettled terrain upon which others may follow. That is, rather than follow the established path created by others, entrepreneurs often challenge the status quo by attempting to chart a new direction through the creation of new products, services, and/ or processes. However, this book is not about trailblazing in coastal reserves or in product markets but about trailblazing in the field of entrepreneurship. We believe that scholars can be trailblazers, and in doing so, they can create new knowledge that others can build on to create additional knowledge and inform practice. Although this trailblazing may not have to deal with the poisonous snakes and spiders of Australia, it certainly has its fair share of obstacles, requires considerable effort, and may also lead to dead ends. Along with the challenges of creating a new trail are the intrinsic rewards from the process and the extrinsic rewards from the outcomes of making substantial contributions to knowledge. For scholars traveling along a well-worn path or a semi-worn path, the research outcomes are replication and incremental research, whereas trailblazing creates new knowledge through more radical ideas. Important in trailblazing is knowing where to start and having some knowledge about the terrain to be covered, the tools to help clear the path, and the potential âgemsâ that might be encountered along the way. The purpose of this book is to provide some insights into where trailblazing may be best directed, how, and with what potential outcomes. Specifically, this book offers a series of frameworks from which or within which we believe important research will emergeâresearch that will have a substantial impact on our understanding of an entrepreneurial phenomenon and, thus, on the way we progress with subsequent entrepreneurship research. We emphasize trailblazing (as opposed to taking existing paths) because we strongly believe that the future of the entrepreneurship field is promising but only if our research itself continues to be entrepreneurial. That being said, continuing to be entrepreneurial in our research may be more difficult than it initially appears. The success we have had thus far may lead us into a competency trap (Levitt & March, 1988) that rewards us in the short term but is detrimental to the field in the long term. That is, entrepreneurship researchers sometimes decide to âplay it safe,â using âacceptedâ theories and methods to answer progressively narrower research questions"

An example is the working-class man Gunnar, the son of the sociable tailor who lost his wife early and had to manage his ten children with the help of his eldest daughter. Gunnar is the only man of this generation in our sample who says he took part in the care of his children from early on. He says he had a special âknack for nursing childrenâ. He pushed the pram and changed nappies and helped wash them, remembering this as very unusual for the times. He also took a lot of photos. Gunnarâs love of his father encompassed more than the fatherâs social position, as he also depicts him a unique and mild man who loved cats and people, and was generous to everybody without expecting anything in return. Thus, it may be that this father came to represent care, but without jeopardising his position among other men. Martin and Harald, who are among the oldest men in the sample, could also spend time with their children as they continued a rural gender order by having their jobs close to the home. Martin was educated as a gardener and eventually became the manager of a nursery, which included a house for the family to live in. His wife was in charge of the home and the children, but he could drop by during the day and, for instance, help the children with their homework. Harald took an unusual route for an upper middle-class boy and became a farmer, with his fatherâs help and consent. He emphasises how lucky he was in the choice of his loyal and hardworking wife: Well, I have said that they mostly have their mother to thank for their upbringing, since I had the farm work. And in addition to that I got quite a few positions of trust by and by. The main thing was that we worked for ten hours a day back then, from 6 am or 6.30 am. Then we went inside for food and out again afterwards. And if you had meetings at night, there wasnât much time left for the children. So it was my wife who took care of that. (Harald, b. 1899)"

Far from seeing this as an unequal division of labour, he seems to have claimed his territory and does not wish to share it.

To some extent it would not be possible to disentangle relations and interferences. We argued that families in poverty are limited in their power and that parenting behavior is shaped and influenced by how these parents grew up and lived in poverty. It is not possible to disaggregate exactly how much of their harmful behavior can be attributed to circumstances for which they are not responsible themselves and how much responsibility they have to shoulder. Being poor comes with a restriction of freedom, one that is, however, not total. It would be unjust to neglect poor parents completely as agents of justice; this would either degrade them to children, which they are not, or to persons with severe mental disabilities who are not able to make choice for themselves. Likewise, it"

Surely we are entitled to expect more from ethical theories. The Categorical Imperative can lead to such absurd conclusions (such as the injunction not to lie to a would-be murderer) that it is better to consider it as an elegant intellectual exercise on Kantâs part, rather than a rule intended for practical use. Also disturbing to someone trained in scientific reasoning is the Kantian use of intentions to judge the morality of actions. Rational thinking needs objectively assessable criteria. Results are subject to objective assessment; intentions are not. A traditional idea often proposed as the key to ethics is the âGolden Ruleâ: treat others the way you would wish them to treat you. While useful, it is clearly insufficient, and not always applicable. For a soldier who sees an enemy taking aim, making sure to shoot first is not unethical, but contradicts the golden rule since he most likely does not wish the other soldier to do the same unto him. More fundamentally, the ruleâs naÄ±Ìve assumption of symmetry does not hold in most cases and leads to hypocrisy. A man discussing the ethics of abortion cannot possibly understand the procedureâs potential effect on him, and would be dishonest if he pretended otherwise; ditto for a young adult discussing the ethics of policies for the old, or a billionaire discussing the ethics of unemployment compensation. Another example of traditional approaches to ethics is Spinozaâs treatise. It deserves praise for its emphasis on human freedom and for attempting mathematical-style deductionsâmathematical, however, in style only. A satisfactory system of ethics requires fresh thinking."

And if it comes to a stop and there are principles, they say that these are unknowable since there is no demonstration of them, which alone they say is understanding; but if one cannot know the primitives, neither can what depends on them be understood simpliciter or properly, but only on the suspicion that they are the case. The other party agrees about understanding; for it, they say, occurs only through demonstration. But they argue that nothing prevents there being demonstration of everything; for it is possible for the demonstration to come about in a circle and reciprocally. But we say that neither is all understanding demonstrative, but in the case of the immediates it is non-demonstrable â and that this is necessary is evident; for if it is necessary to understand the things which are prior and on which the demonstration depends, and it comes to a stop at some time, it is necessary for these immediates to be demonstrable. So as to that we argue thus; and we also say that there is not only understanding, but also some principle by which we become familiar with the definitions.4"

Our grammar constantly turns us into perpetrators.8 Thus we break with and ignore everything to do with passivity, with the pathic, with everything that can and does befall us without warning. The ego is seen not only as the precondition of being able to feel something but also and at the same time as the cause of and reason for those feelings. However, while the ego is the precondition for being able to feel something, feelings do not introduce themselves; rather, we are overcome by them. We are stricken by them. Disappointment hurts, fear lames us, hate distorts us, and we are thrown into chaos. Calamities befall us; happiness is not something we can calculate, not even the happiness of the high card, the greatest number. Theater is incendiary. It can inflame the enlightenment concept of the subject and the pragmatism of analytical abstract thought, which seeks to calm itself with quantifiable criteria. The stage attacks the dominance of such rational, causal thought. The ego is exposed; its sovereignty is assaulted, shaken at its core because of this vulnerable exposition. This is meant as a literal occurrence, not as a figurative image. A painful event that causes discomfort. Offends. The tower of our modern self-assurance begins to crack. Not theoretically, but dramatically, involving all senses. Physically, because on stage the actor has to deliver, with his own body, the tenacious problem of modernityâs collective interpretation of the self.

136,18,0.945,Principles and Practice of Case-Based Clinical Reasoning Education : a Method For Preclinical Students,"possess a mental library of illness scripts to facilitate System 1 thinking, those teachers teach something they usually do not do themselves when solving clinical problems This teaching resembles the âdo as I say, not as I doâ approach, in part because they simply cannot express âhow they doâ when they engaged in clinical reasoning. In a recent review of approaches to the teaching of clinical reasoning, Schmidt and Mamede identified two groups of approaches: a predominant serial-cue approach (teachers provide bits of patient information to students and ask them to reason step by step) and a rare whole-task (or whole-case) approach in which all information is presented at once. They conclude that there is little evidence for the serial-cue approach, favored by most teachers and recommend a switch to wholecase approaches (Schmidt and Mamede 2015). While cognitive theory does support whole-task instructional techniques (Vandewaetere et al. 2014), the description of a whole-case in clinical education is not well elaborated. Evidently a whole-case cannot include a diagnosis and must at least be partly serial. But even if all the information that clinicians in practice face is provided to students all at once, the clinical reasoning process that follows has a serial nature, even if it happens quickly. Schmidt and Mamedeâs proposal to first develop causal explanations, second to encapsulate pathophysiological knowledge, and third to develop illness scripts (Schmidt and Mamede 2015) runs the risk of separating biomedical knowledge acquisition from clinical training and regressing to a Flexnerian curriculum. Flexner advocated a strong biomedical background before students start dealing with patients (Flexner 1910). This separation is currently not considered the most useful approach to clinical reasoning education (Woods 2007; Chamberland et al. 2013). Training students in the skill of clinical reasoning is evidently a difficult task, and Schuwirth rightly once posed the question âCan clinical reasoning be taught or can it only be learned?â (Schuwirth 2002). Since the work of Elstein and colleagues, we know that clinical reasoning is not a skill that is trainable independent of a large knowledge base (Elstein et al. 1978). There simply is not an effective and teachable algorithm of clinical problem solving that can be trained and learned, if there is no medical knowledge base. The actual reasoning techniques used in clinical problem solving can be explained rather briefly and may not be very different from those of a car mechanic. Listen to the patient (or the car owner), examine the patient (or the car), draw conclusions, and identify what it takes to solve the problem. There is not much more to it. In difficult cases, medical decision-making can require knowledge of Bayesian probability calculations, understanding of sensitivity and specificity of tests (Kassirer et al. 2010), but clinicians seldom use these advanced techniques explicitly at the bedside. These recommendations are of no avail if students do not have background knowledge, both about anatomical structures and pathophysiological processes and about patterns of signs and symptoms related to illness scripts. When training medical students to think like doctors, we face the problem that we cannot just look how clinicians think and just ask students to mimic that technique. That is for two reasons: one is that clinicians often cannot express well how they think, and the second"
360,494,0.945,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"6 Conclusions Semantic composition is a dynamic process that cannot be understood without simultaneously considering what we are referring to and the concepts associated with the words we are using. Concepts, and thus the words associated with them, encode significant regularities. At the same time, they are plastic, insofar as we must use a finite vocabulary to describe a potentially infinite variety of situations and generalizations in the world. However, once a word is applied to a referent, that word is grounded in a very specific manner, and the referent can influence the way we understand the word and its associated concept(s) in the context of use. This interplay between our conceptual structure and the world is what motivated the first contribution of this paper, namely to propose that modification works in two ways: It can be conceptually afforded, when the modifier and the head introduce concepts that fit to form a complex concept, and the speaker and the hearer use this fit in their interpretations; or referentially afforded, when the result of combining the modifier with the noun depends on specific properties of the referent. This proposal has an antecedent in Asher (2011), but we have made it more explicit and have proposed a specific analysis combining distributional semantics and DRT. Along the way we hope to have made a case for further exploring distributional representations within semantic theory. They are automatically induced (and thus"

Optimising code to make it run faster is an iterative process: 1. Find the biggest bottleneck (the slowest part of your code). 2. Try to eliminate it (you may not succeed but thatâs ok). 3. Repeat until your code is âfast enough.â This sounds easy, but itâs not. Even experienced programmers have a hard time identifying bottlenecks in their code. Instead of relying on your intuition, you should proï¬le your code: use realistic inputs and measure the run-time of each individual operation. Only once youâve identiï¬ed the most important bottlenecks can you attempt to eliminate them. Itâs diï¬cult to provide general advice on improving performance, but I try my best with six techniques that can be applied in many situations. Iâll also suggest a general strategy for performance optimisation that helps ensure that your faster code will still be correct code. Itâs easy to get caught up in trying to remove all bottlenecks. Donât! Your time is valuable and is better spent analysing your data, not eliminating possible ineï¬ciencies in your code. Be pragmatic: donât spend hours of your time to save seconds of computer time. To enforce this advice, you should set a goal time for your code and optimise only up to that goal. This means you will not eliminate all bottlenecks. Some you will not get to because youâve met your goal. Others you may need to pass over and accept either because there is no quick and easy solution or because the code is already well optimised and no signiï¬cant improvement is possible.

299,130,0.945,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"consideration a host of social and psychological variables that influence preference formation. It is additionally beyond the scope of this chapterâand perhaps beyond the scope of human scienceâto present such a comprehensive, consolidated theory. The task of presenting a formal, universal theory is further complicated by the sheer variety of human experience. However, the lesson to be taken from these observations is simple: human preference formation cannot be reduced to a defined set of economic factors. Instead, it must be acknowledged that an indefinite number of environmental, biological, neurological, andâabove all, because how we are socialized determines to a large degree how we respond to the environmental, biological, and neurological conditions of our existenceâsociological variables, through processes that are not yet precisely described, account for vastly more variance in preferences than do economic factors. By taking a step back and considering the big picture rather than remaining wedded to a single disciplineâs assumptions, it becomes possible to sketch out a rough framework for how preferences might be formed and change, and hence the non-economic factors that ultimately affect choice behavior. Developing such a big picture theory would have three main benefits. First, it would go a long way toward helping to organize the sprawling literature on human preference and choice. Once a general framework is established, it will be much easier to understand how each study relates to the others, which, in turn, may help scholars to understand how the thousands of variables they disparately describe interact with each other. Second, it will facilitate a âcrossing of the Rubiconâ between economic and non-economic disciplines that will ultimately yield a stillincomplete but wiser, interdisciplinary approach to preference formation divorced from the âtheory-induced blindnessâ and jockeying for influence that is characteristic of todayâs theories. Third, such a framework would be much better for policymakers, who need a way of thinking about preferences that is universally applicableânot because it is a comprehensive theory of everything with models that are theoretically elegant but clumsy and unwieldy in the real world, but because of its flexibility and the ability to âplug inâ variables in the appropriate location when needed."
118,574,0.945,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"17.2 Studentsâ Essays 17.2.1 Thoughts on Emergency Workersâ Dose Limit, by Toshiyuki Aratani, the University of Tokyo I was able to think about various things as I participated in the PAGES 2011 Summer School. While reflecting on the discussions at the summer school, I selected for my response the first question by Prof. Kosako: âWhat do we think about the emergency workers dose limit? (Cf. Japanese regulation: 100 mSv, changed to 250 mSv during this period) What happened to the remediatorsâ working conditions when dose limits are exceeded while working on emergency tasks?â. The optimization of workersâ radiation dose should be considered. It is unfortunate that while doing emergency work, workers are exposed to large doses. The emergency worker will not be able to work longer in the place when he has exceeded the dose limit. Because the accident has been protracted, skilled workers who were initially on the scene were forced to leave because they exceeded the dose limit. Therefore, further recovery work was in the hands of less skilled workers. It is expected that the accidentâs impact will result in a prolonged situation in which the public would have a greater amount of exposure. In addition, later work is also problematic for workers who exceed the dose limit. So, an emergency dose limit should not be set at too low a value, and policy decisions should be made on the optimization premise. 100 mSv was changed to 250 mSv in this period, in line with the ICRP2007 recommendation written as follows: ~100 mSvâa dose for those engaged in emergency rescue; 500 mSv or 1000 mSvâdoses to avoid deterministic effects may occur, as the dose of those engaged in emergency rescue; nothingâindicating that the lifesaving benefits outweigh the risks to life of others. Evidence shows that there is not a clear current value. First of all, if we have adopted the recommendations of the ICRP value for other regulations, the amount of exposure in an emergency should also be adopted. I have heard that nuclear power is earth-friendly, low cost. This may be right from one side, but from another side this might not be so. While the world is still actively using coal power generation, nuclear power is better to deal with global warming. With the end of the depreciation on a nuclear plant such as Fukushima Daiichi, the fixed costs become significantly less, which means more inexpensive power unmatched by any other means. However, an old power plant like a Fukushima Daiichi can be a defense against disasters. I think it is probably safe even if more disasters occur. Even then, we must consider the mind-boggling issue of the destination for radioactive waste. And we must be prepared for ruin of the"

Perhaps, at some point there will be an insightful genius like Bell who can show that the different interpretations lead to different conclusions that can be experimentally differentiated, and that experiments will then give us some reason for choosing one interpretation over another. But at this point, most physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation. There is no convincing reason not to use this interpretation, so we shall use it without further comment from now on.

31,21,0.945,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Traditional definitions of medical death are unambiguous, describing a final event that leads to the absolute state of being deadâin which case the biological death of a human being (idem identity) is co-terminus with the social death of the person (ipse identity). The biological death of a person has narrative consequences in how we may configure personal identity. In the most formal terms this involves correct signification. Being dead signifies a corpse, a state of non-being, for which the personal pronoun in the phrase âI am (a corpse)â is no longer correct. A corpse refers to a husk, and a husk is no longer a person that actively possesses a body. Furthermore, physical death has relational consequences for others. My death, for example, would mean that my wife would undergo a relational/narrative change: that is, my wife would become a widow. Social death concerns our ipse identityâthe narrative identity of who we are. While social death is dependent on having existed, it is not necessarily co-terminus with existing as a biological entity. Real changes in our biology certainly prompt relational changes in how we may configure the narratives of our lives. After a heart attack, for example, there may be a subtle shift in who we understand ourselves to be through what we believe we are realistically capable of doing. This may signal a subtle shift in our personality. Less subtly, brain injury, as argued earlier, can lead to narrative inversions in our clinical status: from a living person that is self-conscious and aware of others, to a living human organism which in PVS is not conscious in this way. A relational change in the meaning of who a person is has both an existential as well as a biological dimension. The narrative of who we are is existentially anticipated in the face of our physical mortality. We existentially configure the meaning of our lives in anticipation of our physical death. This has a secular and religious dimension. In secular terms the meaning of our life matters beyond its physical annihilation. For example: we might suffer a serious brain injury that marks our autobiographical death destroying our dignity; we resonably anticipate being respectfully treated and honestly remembered after our physical life has ended. In spiritual/religious terms we may anticipate who we are and how we might continue in a life hereafter. If one believes that how we treat mortal remains matters for a disembodied life hereafter, then the burial rituals associated with keeping the corpse intact take on a special ânarrativeâ significance."
309,122,0.945,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"He-Goat Meat A group of Hoianese friends with whom I used to have lunch every now and again often played a food/word game that, at first, I couldnât figure out. One of the diners would pick up a morsel of food, say a piece of rau muÃ´Ìng (water morning-glory), and ask: âÄn rau bá» gÃ¬?â (â[when] eating greens/vegetables, what gets nourished?â). After a short reflection, one of the co-diners would reply: âÄn rau bá» rÃ¢u!â (â[when] eating vegetable, [the] beard [is] nourished!â), and everyone would burst in loud laughter. After a while, another diner would pick up a different food item, say a shrimp, and ask: âwhen eating shrimp, what gets nourished?â The answer would be: âwhen eating shrimp, the shrimp is nourishedâ (âÄn tÃ´m bá» tÃ´m!â), stirring yet another burst of laughter. Things could get even more incomprehensible, as when someone would ask: âwhen eating shrimp, what gets nourished?â, to which the answer would be: âwhen eating shrimp, the banana is nourished!â (âÄn tÃ´m bá» chuÃ´Ìi!â). As my language skills improved, I realized that this confusing food/ word game was actually very sophisticated and had an erotic/sexist undertone, which was well known to the participants and the reason for their laughter: each bite of food insinuated a sex-related body organ. The word rau, which means âvegetableâ, was replaced by rÃ¢u, which means âbeardâ but is also used for body hair and for pubic hair. The meaning of the sentence was: when eating greens, the pubic hair is nourished. TÃ´m (shrimp), my friends explained, represented the vagina due to its curvilinear shape. However, when eaten by men, it nourishes their âbananaâ or penis. I also learned that when sÅ©Ìa chim or âbirdâs milkâ was offered, usually by one of the men to either of the women, he was actually referring to semen and was thus suggesting oral sex, as chim, or âbirdâ, is commonly used for the penis. Another double-edged invitation would be to eat âclamsâ (nghÃªu), which stand for the vulva. Thus, while having lunch, these friends were conducting an anatomically detailed conversation about sex, using only food terms, demonstrating the Vietnamese ability to maintain virtuous and chaste faÃ§ade despite the great interest in, and practical engagement with sexâboth within and beyond marriage. This was summarized by a female friend, merely 18 at the time, who realizing my surprise at the juicy piece of gossip she"

Currently I deal with people who are not solely working in IT firms. They have managers of my age, that is, around thirty. We all went to school in the Soviet era. Q: Do you have different values or do you work differently? P4: I donât know, it is difficult to talk about the others. I can only say that in my mind those around thirtyâthirty-five still remember school well. Those who finished school in the beginning of the 1990s already have completely new values and they look at life in a completely different way. In my head, the Soviet legacy still remains. (general director, p4) An example of the problems of transformation for the Soviet generation was learning how to behave in business. This knowledge consists of, for example, working routines and habits and is accumulated over time in organizations but is rarely put into writing (cf. Podolny and Baron 1997). These habitual ways of acting are thus usually not learned from books but typically by imitating or interacting with colleagues or a mentor, or simply by doing. One of our respondents, who had worked for most of his career in the Soviet Union, emphasized â in addition to learning new habits â the unlearning of the Soviet routines and ways of acting when comparing himself with the 20-year-old CEO of a well-known software company: Q: There are things which are difficult to learn from books, which you can only learn through your own experience or by observing the experience of your older colleagues.

All of these big questions are embedded within the world of philanthropy. This book looks at how these questions play out in the choices people make about how to help each other in eleven Asian economies. Culture and history surely play a role as does information and data. Throughout Asia, societies are evolving and new models of governance are being tested. Some of them will succeed and others will not but in the iterative process of moving forward, we will all continue to explore and experiment with the relationship between governments, companies and people. Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the most dominant power in the world, with its soft power extending far beyond military and economic might. America has helped shape the way we think, the way we act, the way we dream and the way we treat one another. Much of this influence has been very positive and the world has welcomed the values prescribed in a Judeo-Christian set of principles. Now, at a time when India and China are once again becoming dominant world powers, the question is: what will be the influence of our soft power? This book, by casting a spotlight on Asian philanthropy, is coming at a pivotal moment in time. We are pleased to be part of this conversation. Both of us have long embraced our fortunate ability to make contributions to improving peopleâs lives and helping to progress societies. We see more and more of our peers coming to the realization that we have a role to play and we should do so with intention and with care. Post war modernity, globalism, education, and various reforms have accelerated job and wealth creation as well as philanthropy. This book fills the important need of shining a light on the patterns of philanthropy and volunteer organizations in Asia today. It provides models and strategies of effective engagement as well as showcasing the changes now taking place. We are pleased to be part of bringing this important book to the growing number of donors and philanthropists, government policymakers, non-profit leaders, teachers and students who may be drawn to social service and philanthropy and who can really use the information and insights contained here.

With reference to the Global Scenario Group report (2002) I discussed this view as SETS camp: without checking for biases and differences in these assumptions, no change agent will understand how and why people expressing the same goals can so utterly disagree on the best ways forward. Although my intention is to bring all of these perspectives together, I refrained from adding a fourth literacy concept. The deï¬nition of transformative literacy captures exactly what I am after and I am thus suggesting that the realm of what is required to attain it should be amended with the key points of the other two"

As long as that switch is on, the microprocessor doesnât do anything. When you turn off the switch, the microprocessor begins executing machine code at address 0000h. To use this control panel, you turn the Reset switch on to reset the microprocessor and to stop it from executing machine code. You turn on the Takeover switch to take over the address bus and data bus. At this time, you can use the switches labeled A0 through A15 to specify a 16-bit memory address. The lightbulbs labeled D0 through D7 show you the 8-bit contents of that memory address. To write a new byte into that address, you set up the byte on switches D0 through D7 and flip the Write switch on and then off again. After youâre finished inserting bytes into memory, turn the Takeover switch off and the Reset switch off, and the microprocessor will execute the program. This is how you enter your first machine-code programs into a computer that youâve just built from scratch. Yes, itâs unbearably laborious. That goes without saying. That you will make little mistakes now and then is a given. That your fingers will get blisters and your brain will turn to mush is an occupational hazard.

78,278,0.945,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"Hence, in order to really enable and support epistemic responsibility it would be essential to revise and amend current the RRI guidelines by adding new guiding thoughts such as the following: 1. Acknowledge the interrelation of epistemology, ethics and ontology: knowing, doing and being are interrelated, i.e. our processes of knowing have effects on what can be done and what we areâand vice versa. 2. Keep in mind the deep socio-technical entanglement of contemporary epistemic practices: Within our practices of knowing, we depend upon other human and non-human agents just as much as these other agents depend on us. 3. Bear in mind that epistemic relations are power relations: Within socio-technical epistemic systems, different epistemic agents, human as well as non-human agents, such as algorithms, are equipped with different amounts of power. 4. â¦ etc Thus, if revised appropriately, RRI could provide guidance on how to act responsibly in research and innovation as particularly knowledge-intense domains. Yet epistemic practices exist beyond research and governance supporting epistemic responsibility accordingly has to be expanded beyond advice or regulations regarding research and innovation. Each and every one of us has to assume epistemic responsibility for the things we claim to know in our everyday life as well. When and whom should we trust to know about climate change, about the war on terrorism or just about the latest unemployment numbers? How vigilant do we have to be when accepting information received from various on- and offline sources? While these are challenges that we all face on a daily basis, they also pose challenges for the governance of socio-technical epistemic systems. In a computational age characterized by ever more powerful personalization and profiling techniques assuming epistemic responsibility becomes much harder, because we may neither be able to decide which information we receive nor which information is received about us. After all, how can we be responsible knowers if we cannot assess how trustworthy our sources of knowledge are? Without denying the utility of personalized services, in order to act epistemically responsible in an age of extensive profiling and personalization, we need the possibility to access, understand and to even trick the systems which are accessing, understanding and potentially tricking us. As Mireille Hildebrandt stresses in her contribution, we need to develop âfirst (â¦) human machine interfaces that give us unobtrusive intuitive access to how we are being profiled, and, second, a new hermeneutics that allows us to trace at the technical level how the algorithms can be âreadâ and contestedâ (Hildebrandt 2013). We need policies addressing more broadly the challenges related to distributed epistemic responsibility in a hyperconnected reality, policies to set the parameters for an environment where individuals can act responsibly, i.e. where they can both assume and attribute responsibility even if they are deeply socio-technically entangled. To conclude: in the long run, it will be essential to develop a concept of epistemic responsibility that can account for the responsibilities of various differently empowered agents within entangled socio-technical epistemic systems.

For many of the interviewed mothers as well as for others in familial care-taking roles, this pivotal moment was the responsibility for small children. The wish to provide harmless and healthy food to the children was often expressed: âSometimes I go to another organic shop to buy the same food [as in this shop] because now I have a child. My son is six months. Today is the first day of his weaning.â As Bich, regular customer, university lecturer and mother of two young children indicates here, the stop at the organic shop constitutes a task often in addition to regular grocery shopping which is done elsewhere. Moreover, opting for organic food on the first day of weaning suggests the importance put on the high food quality intended for the child from the very first bite. Thanh, who was accompanied by her four-year old grandson, depicted the interlaced events of expecting a baby in the family with a case of food poisoning, leading the whole family to change their consumption habits: When my daughter was pregnant, I bought green cauliflower and water spinach and string bean, my daughter had these foods, and had [food] poison[ing].

Only quite a while after I first met her did I learn that she is a Catholic. Interestingly, she did not refer to herself as âCroatâ but only as Catholic. It is not uncommon among the oldest members of the population to refer to the three ânationsâ according to their religionâas Muslims, Catholics and Orthodoxâas had been common before the rise of nationalism. While younger generations still use the term âMuslimâ and âBosniakâ alternately, they no longer refer to Croats and Serbs as Catholics and Orthodox, respectively. This linguistic usage manifests clearly how identity categories have changed their meanings even within a lifetime. Danicaâs parents migrated from Czechoslovakia to Sarajevo at the beginning of the 20th century, where she lived until she married a Mostarian and moved to his hometown. Today, she feels closer to Mostar than to Sarajevo since she has spent more than 50 years in Mostar. When Danica and I sat together, she liked to talk about the beautiful Mostar of the time when she was young. Central to her narratives were places where young people liked to spend time, among them the Old Bridge and Å¡etaliÅ¡te (pedestrian street) at Rondo (today in West Mostar), and stories of a happy family life. In 1992, Danica lost most of her closest kin, including her husband, father, mother, brother and sister. A couple of years later one of her two daughters died. All of them, she said, died of a ânaturalâ death. Now she lives together with her daughterâs former husband and her grandson.4 Danicaâs grandson is an active figure in a well-established youth NGO in Mostar.

RamÃ³n will never be an intellectual. He will never be an ideologue. He wasnât very fond of the classes in political economy and history that they had in Cuba, he confided. In fact, I suspected that his literacy skills were at minimum level. But through the Frente, he got a political identity, social and political companionship, a sense of belonging. From his guts, if not from a coherent ideological set of ideas, he contributed to the political processes Venezuela was experiencing. He had even participated in constructing the apartment buildings they were now living in as well as the highway that ran past them. Even though RamÃ³n and Abigayl had only moved some 100 meters away from where their old shack used to be, they had in reality taken a step into a completely different life. To live in an apartment and to live in a rancho was for them worlds apart. And it was as if both of them had changed. I couldnât point to exactly what, but they had a new air to them, a new way of talking, as if their new physical surroundings had become imprinted in their bodies, into their way of moving. The apartment was scarcely furnished, and the furniture that they had was old and shabby. The water supply in the apartments was unstable as the work on the underground tanks that would supply the apartments had not been finished. Yet, they both felt that they had started a new chapter in life. Abigayl told me that she was about to start night classes with MisiÃ³n Ribas in order to complete high school. After that, she wanted to study social work. RamÃ³n continued finding employment in the construction sectors, in the other apartment projects that were under way in the area. El Chino and el Ruso, who were racing around the apartment on two small bikes, nodded when I asked them if they liked their new home. RamÃ³n in particular seemed calmer. He was standing outside on the narrow French balcony, pointing down to the plaza between the two apartment blocks that were facing each other. âWe are all good neighbors,â he said. âWe meet down in the patio to play domino and talk, but there arenât any problems here, and besides, there are several policemen living here.â He also confided that he drank less now. He just drank some beer when he played domino down in the plaza, but other than that he just worked as much as he could."

Technology can make learning accessible 24/7âand help transform the way we acquire knowledge and skills in the twenty-first century.

Meanwhile, we retain an inexhaustible reservoir of vision and of contrariness. Once this power of resistance enlists practical ingenuity and living social forces in its service, it can do more than may seem feasible. The fact about us is that we are the beings who never entirely fit into the social and conceptual worlds that we build and inhabit. There is always more in us than in them. Although we can improve them, we can never improve them enough to lose reasons to resist them. We can â indeed we must â deny them the last word, and keep it for ourselves. We can â indeed we should â see, do and create more than they countenance. Social innovation is the creation of a new way of acting and cooperating in some part of society. As society is divided into distinct domains that are arranged according to different rules and conceptions â the worlds of business, of politics, of social services, of the âthird sectorâ, of the academy or of the media â the practice of social innovation must always begin in one of these areas. It must identify a problem that has not been solved in that corner of society and that cannot be solved by its conventional practices and established institutions. It must exemplify, through a practical initiative, a way of understanding the problem and of dealing with it. It must do its work in such a way that the initiative does more than address the immediate problem. It must also suggest a path for the reform of the part of social life in which it began, with implications for the larger society. For example, if it begins as business it must be successful as business and yet effective as well in the advancement of a concern that business, as now organised, commonly fails to share. Its innovations must point beyond themselves. Today the opportunity for such a practice is likely to be greatest in departments of social life that are orphaned by both the state and the market, or that lie in a netherworld between economic and political action, or that require initiatives that neither business firms nor political parties seem capable of conceiving and promoting. Such an activity cannot take place unless it has an agent. Social regimes are organised to reproduce themselves. If they allowed no room for their own reshaping, social innovation would be impossible â except through individual and collective rebellion, in the favouring circumstance of crisis. If they had done much more to open themselves to challenge and change than they have, social innovation might be unnecessary. It is in the real, intermediate situation that social innovation becomes both needed and possible as a practice bidding to become a movement. It takes its cue from the failure of political parties and of business firms, and more generally of all established organisations in society, to do what needs to be done to address the unresolved problems of society."

By putting mirrors in the appropriate places and adding delays, we can construct the gate so that the outputs are lined up with the inputs and when balls enter at the same time they leave at the same time. (This is depicted in figure 6.22.) We can then form circuits that contain more than one Fredkin gate.* Since the Fredkin gate is universal, it can be used to construct any boolean circuit. Consequently, any boolean circuit can be constructed using just billiard balls and mirrors. Fredkin believes that the universe is a computer. He didnât convince Feynman of this, but the billiard ball computer did impress him. As they both realized, any slight error in the position or velocity of a ball would result in an error that would propagate and get amplified. Collisions are never perfectly elastic; there is always friction and heat is lost. The billiard ball computer is clearly just a theoretical machine, not something that can be constructed in practice. But this machine does conjure images of atoms bouncing off one another, and it led Feynman to consider gates based on quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics. We look at this idea in the next chapter. * There is a great animation showing this gate with balls entering and leaving on the website http://www.bubblycloud.com/billiard/fredkin-from-switches.html."

Nobody asked where you were from. Nobody asked who your father was or if you could pay. They just accepted each of us, taking us in with warmth, sheltering children, often without their parentschildren who cried in the night from nightmares; by Elizabeth Koenig-Kaufman, a former child refugee in Le Chambon.7 As years passed I have become more aware of the relation that Hagedorn must have had with Le Chambon. What I learned about begins in Fall 1963, when, as Maurice Jacob describes it in Chap. 3 they met in India; at that time, Hagedorn had enrolled his young daughter at the Boarding School Le CollÃ©ge-LycÃ© CvÌenol International in Le Chambon. A school at the time filled with children associated with the holocaust survivors, a school located in a small village 4.5 h long hours by car from CERN, just about ânowhereâ in the midst of France. If you were not aware what happened in Le Chambon, this school is hard to find and for this reason the school is about to close today. However, this is a place Hagedorn and his wife liked to ride horses in the hills of the French Central Plateau, a place he turned to within a relatively short time after his arrival at CERN, at a time at which the story of this remarkable place was not yet told. Is this just a coincidence? Let me tell the rest of the story. Aside of music which Hagedorn loved as is also described by Maurice Jacob in Chap. 3, Hagedorn liked â. . . a little History of Arts and related topicsâ which is a quote from his 1954 personal short biography as printed below. This in turn led to his interest in photography, a topic also raised by Maurice. Once he had time, in retirement, Hagedorn learned to create his own color prints. He mentioned this to me, later I realized, as a warning. In September 1989âabout 10â11 years after taking me, along with his wife and mine, on a long weekend trip to Le Chambon-Sur-Lignonâhe had sent a set of A4 large prints from this event, which he was keen to tell me, he made himself. As Maurice Jacob ably describes Hagedorn liked photography, so there are many more pictures he could print besides the Le Chambon event, but he did not. I kept these prints on my desk while developing a plan to thank Hagedorn appropriately. In the interim the photographs reminded me of our visit to Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon a decade earlier, and the name of this village, long forgotten, was in consequence in my mind. I did recall that these photographs were taken at local spots important to Hagedorn who took us to these places and who set up the photo shots in detail."
223,21,0.945,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"In decision-making and goal-oriented social action, formal logic must be combined with knowledge, expertise, skills, and the newest information. Because actors differ in their levels of information, knowledge, skills, experience, and educational achievement, they arrive at very different decisions if they follow the principle of rational decision-making. What seems rational to an agent who has little expertise and relies on public information might be irrational to an actor with great expertise or to a stock broker with insider knowledge. â[A] given act may appear rational at the time it is undertaken; yet when a different goal is activated to which that act was detrimental it may appear irrational and one might come to regret itâ (Kruglanski & Orehek, 2009, p. 647). High levels of knowledge, skill, expertise, and early access to important information help people come to decisions that are apt to achieve the desired goal. Gaps in expertise, skills, educational achievement, and information usually restrict goal attainment.12 Like any goal-directed activity, thinking can be done well or badly. Thinking that is done well is thinking of the sort that achieves its goals. When we criticize peopleâs thinking, we are trying to help them achieve their own goals. When we try to think well, it is because we want to achieve our goals. (Baron, 2008, p. 29)"

And if the world does not go to church, then the Church has to go to the world.â2 This priest is a youth priest with an active Facebook profile. He preaches and gives film reviews on local radio, publishes his own songs and preaches sermons on his YouTube channel. There are other examples which suggest that social media are an integral part of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany; for example, the organization for clerical professions and ecclesiastical services of the German bishop conference [Zentrum fÃ¼r Berufungspastoral der Deutschen Bischofskonferenz] started the project âValerieundderPriesterâ in 2016,3 in which a young non-religious female journalist accompanies a priest and publishes her observations on different media formats such as blogs, Facebook, and YouTube. And even some of the German bishops themselves have begun to tweet. At first glance, social media seem to have arrived in the world of religious organizations: namely the Church. Nevertheless, religious organizationsâand the Catholic Church in particularâare said to be more reluctant to accept change than many other organizations. And furthermore, people seem to have different expectations of how the Catholic Church has to deal and interact with media: one example is the response to the aforementioned wedding, where reactionsâin magazines, television, newspapers as well as in social mediaâranged widely, from statements such as âFinally a Catholic priest who speaks casually and touches my heart!â to responses such as âNot a Church for pagans but a Church of pagans!â And within the religious organization itself, we can observe quite critical remarks regarding digital media: for example, the leader of the German bishop conference, Cardinal Marx, who stressed during a press conference in 2015 that âblogging sometimes leads to dementia, doesnât it?â.4 So, the crucial question remains: how exactly does the Roman Catholic Church act and react towards media? Depending on their perspective, academic studies emphasize either a high mediatization or a low mediatization of religious organizations with resistance to media change. What is the reason for such contradicting evaluations concerning religious organizations and how can they be explained? In this article, we analyze an exemplary religious organization, namely the Roman Catholic Church, and ask for specific resistance to media change.

Instead, I focus on her narrative because it poses important questions crucial to this discussion. Sabina, an energetic and communicative young woman in her early 20s, grew up in a town about 200 kilometres from Mostar. By the time I met her, she had been living in Mostar for more than three years already. She fell in love with the city right from the beginning. After spending the war years together with her little sister at her auntâs place in Zagreb (the rest of her family remained in their hometown and her father joined the HVO), she returned to her comparatively small hometown. Later on, it was a relief for her to move to Mostar for her studies at SveuÄiliÅ¡te because Mostar offers not only a beautiful Old Town but also a vibrant student life, with plenty of cafÃ©s, pubs and parties. Already during the first days after her arrival in Mostar, she was desperate to see the Old Bridge. All her colleagues warned her not to go to the Old Town, saying she would put herself in danger if she did not take their advice seriously. But she did not pay attention to them and, as she had expected, nothing untoward happened to her. Sabina is aware that nobody can tell the difference between a Bosniak and a Croat just from appearance alone. They could identify her from her accent (mainly because she spent a long time in Zagreb) but no one in the Old Town treated her offensively. Today, she frequently crosses the Bulevar (the main-street before the war and frontline during the war), especially because of her involvement in one of the youth NGOs situated on the east side. Through her activities at the NGO she met a young Bosniak with whom she fell in love. Sabina is aware that if her parents find out about the relationship they would strongly disapprove. Sabina is very aware of her national background. She also shows an interest in learning more about it by studying Croat language and literature. Catholicism plays a central part in her life as well. Nevertheless, her strong national awareness does not prevent her from believing that Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs can live together in one city in the same state.

In fact, some activists actually seekâpreferably internationalâvisibility, not only to advertise their cause but also because they believe it gives them some level of protection. When a respondent articulates such a strategy, it would not make sense to overrule him or her for their protection. A final reason to anonymize a respondent without being asked to do so can be the long delays in the publishing process, and a change in the situation on the ground during this process. Information that was not sensitive when provided may become sensitive by the time it is published. One of us, for instance, had the consent of (some) Egyptian activists to be mentioned by their first name in early 2013, but decided because of the subsequent military crackdown, that in subsequent publications they needed to be given aliases for their protection."

[Just like] our partner universities [who] would have a vice rector in international cooperation. There must be one person to manage this step and make sure that the university people know who to address. Mobility and exchange programs have to be in one personâs hands.â Implicit here is a set of challenges related to what appears to be an artiï¬cial division of responsibilities across two institutions (the university and the CBPAM) and often within one institution (IO and Bologna Ofï¬ce) centred on one set of activities: academic mobility. (This participant described the emphasis on academic mobility this way: âAs for now, we understand the Bologna Process as only academic mobility. Most universities do the same.â) At issue is whether IO staff have the capacity to work across this division of labour to achieve institutional goals for one institutional strategic plan. This capacity challenge is suggested by one International Ofï¬cer interviewed who described her view that her IO staff should be made aware of âBologna Process related laws and articlesâ, but they do not receive any information or training either at her institution or through the CBPAM: âI would introduce the staff to the Bologna Process-related laws and articles. They need to know. Itâs relevant to our work. But the university leadership does not initiate this training.â When asked whether her staff were ever invited to the CBPAM for training, she replied, âNo. The IO is not invited.â At this stage, this challenge is merely suggested in the interviews and needs to be explored in greater depth as an issue that may become increasingly signiï¬cant in the future, when the planned closure of the CBPAM devolves Bologna-related work to other national institutions in 2015. This could have a signiï¬cant impact on the nature of IO work, and capacity development may emerge as important."
185,136,0.945,The Essence of Software Engineering,"1 Apologia When the words âsoftwareâ and âengineeringâ were first put together [Naur and Randell 1968] it was not clear exactly what the marriage of the two into the newly minted term really meant. Some people understood that the term would probably come to be defined by what our community did and what the world made of it. Since those days in the late 1960âs a spectrum of research and practice has been collected under the term. Journals, magazines, conferences, and workshops have used it in growing numbers. From time to time some have questioned whether or not the second word of the term, âengineeringâ, is properly applied to what it is that âsoftware engineersâ do (e.g. [Parnas 1997]). The debate has been sporadic, but it has probably been good for the community. It seems odd, however, that there has been hardly any discussion of the first word of the term, namely âsoftwareâ. When, on infrequent occasion, the meaning of this term has been questioned, mostly in informal conversation, the question has been met with visible discomfort, and some attempt to dismiss it. The purpose of this paper is to try to address the question head-on. What is software? If our community feels comfortable in believing that it is engaged in the practice of engineering âsoftwareâ, it seems that the community should show some curiosity about what it is that is the subject of its ministrations. But, when asked to ponder what âsoftwareâ is, computer software engineers seem to assume that the only kind of software is computer software. They provide answers that roughly equate software with code to be executed on a computer. When prodded, most will readily agree that the software they produce consists of more than just the code, but also somehow incorporates specifications of various kinds, designs, and perhaps testing regimes and results as well. But when it is suggested that there might be types of software other than computer software, some computer software engineers have questioned the value of considering the possibility. Here we suggest that considering this possibility might lead to an understanding of what these various kinds of software have in common, and thus what the nature of âsoftwareâ is. Some have suggested that the quintessential nature of âsoftwareâ may be imponderable and unknowable. This may indeed be the case, but it seems worth noting that humans have in the past asked many âunanswerableâ questions, about the nature of such things as love, God, truth, and reality. While the answers often have not been very satisfying, the pondering and discussion of them has typically been interesting, revealing, and sometimes ennobling. For these reasons, and others, it does not seem inappropriate to offer this short essay, hoping that it may help to start a debate that turns out to be, at least, interesting."
108,145,0.945,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"was conducted using field theory, with the theoretical terms sometimes clearly shown and sometimes indicated through the use of synonyms. Even though the actors did not always think in field theory terms, it is still possible to apply that perspective. To that should be added that much indicates that MiloÅ¡eviÄ and Tudjman, without any actual theoretical knowledge, could think and act in a manner reminiscent of the field theory approach. That is something you can and also probably actually do if you are an actor on the field. The opposite can be said about many of the other actors who really did not try to understand the social field and thus really did not take the duel-situation between them and their counterparts seriously. One can also see that it was possible to extrapolate the coming events by studying the actors and that their rationality also could be perceived. This is exactly the information one needs if one wants to affect actors by changing the social structure on a field. PSYOPS could be applied right through the whole event chain, not only during the phase when open war was played out. Even a bombing or an assassination of other actors than those you want to affect can be part of a PSYOPS operation. Exactly what could have been done is speculative and beyond the point of this text. The important thing is that it was possible to operate in this setting with a social field perspective as guidance. The aim has been to show that field theory can fulfil the criteria necessary for a theory to qualify as a valuable instrument for military planning. The discussion has demonstrated that social theory can be employed as an operational tool. The theory can serve to encourage reflection and therefore refine oneâs thoughts, provided that it is first understood and assimilated as a way of thinking. This provision was fulfilled when the theory was shown to be able to be linked, for example, to the questions and issues that a military intervention might have to face. The theory was also shown to be applicable to the empirical example given. One counter to this claim is of course that it is a theoretical examination of empirical data that has been conducted. The next step is to apply the theory in an actual empirical study. But for this to be possible the theory must first be further developed and then practical measures taken to enable theoretical ambitions to be realisedâin other words a task outside this study. One question that is inherent and needs to be answered following this type of study is: what resources are required to enable the creation of a field theory image of military area of operations?"
48,5,0.945,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"systematic review of relevant research,1 it is likely to have been biased towards our own research on time predictions. That is the privilege of authoring a book. On some of the topics we address, only a few research studies have been published, sometimes only one. The results and recommendations based on such limited evidence should be taken with a grain of salt, so please use your common sense if advice or a result sounds unreasonable in your context. The terminology used when talking about time predictions is far from standardized. Other terms are effort estimation, time forecasts, and performance time predictions. We will use the term time usage prediction or just time prediction in this book. Although the bookâs focus is on how much work a task or project requires, we also add results on the prediction of the point in time (completion time) and the number of days (duration) in which we predict the work to be completed. The book starts with a brief chapter on prediction successes and disasters, illustrating how poorly and how well people can be at predicting time (Chap. 1). We then reflect on how judgement-based time predictions are made and how central they are to our lives (Chap. 2). If you are mainly interested in the practical aspects of time predictions, you may want to skip these chapters and go directly to Chap. 3. That chapter describes the basis for time predictions, with an emphasis on the importance of probability-based thinking. A good grasp of this chapter is important for an understanding of what comes later. The chapter on overoptimism (Chap. 4) gives several possible explanations of why time predictions are often overoptimistic. As you will learn here, a tendency towards overoptimistic time predictions is not necessarily caused by a disposition towards overoptimism and may have many other explanations. Chapter 5 reviews common time prediction biases, their importance, and when they are likely to occur. An awareness of these biases is important to improve time prediction processes. In many situations, a simple number stating how many work hours are required is not enough. One would also like to know something about the conï¬dence in and the uncertainty of the time prediction. We have, therefore, included a chapter reporting what is known about our tendency to be overconï¬dent (Chap. 6), that is, the tendency to think that our time predictions are more accurate than they are. In Chap. 7, we describe how to improve the accuracy of time usage predictions through the use of evidence-based techniques, methods, and principles. The two latter chapters are the most practically oriented. If you just want advice on how to improve time prediction and uncertainty assessments, these are the main parts to read. Finally, we include a guide to selecting time prediction methods (Chap. 8) and a chapter describing how easy it is to influence people into making overoptimistic time predictions (Chap. 9). Besides the authors (the sequence of authorship was determined based on coin flips), a number of people have contributed to this book. In particular, we would like to thank Karl Halvor Teigen, Scott Armstrong, and Jostein Rise for valuable"

We left them with enough supplies to keep stocking shops in Tbilisi and in large cities. I was relieved that our improvised system of price control was working. There was no shortage of any of the essential products and nobody panicked. Nobody even skipped a line in a supermarket, and nobody broke any trafï¬c rules. The fact that the people of Georgia were so lawabiding, so supportive of each other, and so calm despite the invasion made me incredibly proud of my country. Still, that whole period is very much a blur to me. Our days started at 7 am in the morning and ended at 4 am the next morning. We went through prices, took stock of supplies, and arranged for deliveries. Based on our intelligence about the movements of the Russian army, we tried to anticipate where our citizens might take refuge and arranged to have food supplies waiting for them. When food supplies started to run low at wholesalersâ warehouses, we started importing food supplies ourselves. We rented a few warehouses around Tbilisi and near Batumi to store our imports. We bought supplies for Western Georgia from Turkey and for Eastern Georgia from Azerbaijan. As it happened, one of my fellow ministers, Alexander âAleâ Khetaguri, the minister of energy, had been on an ofï¬cial visit in Azerbaijan when the Russians invaded Georgia. I asked him to stay in Baku to help manage the imports. Every day, I received a report about the stock of supplies in our warehouses. Based on this information, we imported additional goods from Turkey and Azerbaijan. There were even some cases of wartime heroism behind the lines. Quite understandably, some drivers had refused to drive trucks loaded with supplies through territory that was controlled by the Russians. In those cases, employees of the revenue service got behind the wheel themselves and drove the vehicles past the posts of the Russian army. In another case, we had to build a tent city to provide shelter for thousands of internally displaced persons from the Tskhinvali region. We had the necessary materials and we had a suitable site, but we had no manpower to put up the tents. Most members of the army and the police were at the front line. I called on the members of parliament to help out. In less than an hour, they were on site, with their friends and families, and rolled up their sleeves. By the next morning, the tent city was ready. It housed thousands of internally displaced persons â women and men, children and old people, newborn babies and pregnant women. Volunteers delivered bread and sausages several times a day to feed them."

Then Japan should have shifted from the growth model of a developing country to that of an advanced country. Nevertheless, the country failed to make the shift. That failure still lies behind todayâs problems. When Japan was a developing country, the central government took the initiative in developing industries, which resulted in improved living standards of the people. Now Japan is one of the most advanced economies in the world, and the Japanese society is fully matured. Japan is now a âproblem-saddled advanced country.â We still do not see what Japan should become in the future nor which industries might help revitalize the economy and best position the country for a promising future. Today, advanced countries like Japan must proceed and plan for the future without a model example. We have no other choice than to clarify the issues, establish goals to solve them, and build an advanced society worthy of being called a role model for the world. This should be the right way for Japan to reconstruct itself. I believe that Japan has sufficient cutting-edge technology and cultural imagination to enable it to achieve its goals. New demand and a new economy will be created through seeking solutions to the complex problems that all advanced nations face in the twenty-first century. In this context, I believe Japanâs regeneration will be a new model for solving global issues, one that can serve as a universal ideal for the world."

If it were global, the adversary would be able to store away the return pointer in a global data structure (i.e. there exists a global capability for it), and jump to it later, in circumstances where this should not be possible. For example, they could store the return pointer, legally jump to it a first time, wait to be invoked again and then jump to the old return pointer a second time, instead of the new return pointer received for the second invocation. Similarly, they could store the return pointer, invoke a function in our code, wait for us to invoke them again and then jump to the old return pointer rather than the new one, received for the second invocation. By making the return pointer local, we prevent such attacks: the adversary can only store local capabilities through write-local capabilities, which means (because of our assumptions above): on the stack. Since the stack pointer itself is also local, it can also only be stored on the stack. Because we clear the part of the stack that the adversary has had access to before we pass control back, there is no way for them to recover either of these local capabilities. Note that storing stack pointers for use during future invocations would also be dangerous in itself, i.e. not just because it can be used to store return pointers. Imagine the adversary stores their stack pointer, invokes trusted code that uses part of the stack to store private data and then invokes the adversary again with a stack pointer restricted to exclude the part containing the private data. If the adversary had a way of keeping hold of their old stack pointer, it could access the private data stored there by the trusted code and break local-state encapsulation. Returning from the Adversary. So return pointers must be passed as local capabilities. But what should their permissions be, what memory should they point to and what should that memory (the activation record) contain? Let us answer the last question first by considering what should happen when the adversary jumps to a return pointer. In that case, the program counter should be restored to the instruction after the jump to the adversary, so the activation record should store this old program counter. Additionally, the stack pointer should also be restored to its original value. Since the adversary has a more restricted authority over the stack than the code making the call, we cannot hope to reconstruct the original stack pointer from the stack pointer owned by the adversary. Instead, it should be stored as part of the activation record. Clearly, neither of these capabilities should be accessible by the adversary. In other words, the return pointer provided to the adversary must be a capability that they can jump to but not read from, i.e. an enter capability. To make this work, we construct the activation record as depicted in Fig. 4. The e return pointer has authority over the entire activation record (containing the previous return and stack pointer), and its current address points to a number of restore instructions in the record, so that upon invocation, these instructions are executed and can load the old stack pointer and program counter back into the register file. As the return pointer is an enter pointer, the adversary cannot get"

Some participants foreground or background their Asian identity according to which context and friends they are among. One participant foregrounds his Asian identity among his Danish friends, while another participant foregrounds her Asian identity when she is among her Asian friends. This shows that identity is changeable and complex, as one given situation can amplify either feelings of belonging or alienation. Only a few do not relate to different groups, which can be seen as yet another example of wanting to be included into the dominant group and not having an in-between identity. As seen before, the dominant discourse is powerful, as the fear of being othered is always present. One participant experiences this among his friends when they ask questions about his Vietnamese culture."

The month of Ramadan is celebrated with communal meals, congregational prayers and giving a lot to the needy and indigent. Every Muslim has to make hajj, at least once in a lifetime, if he can afford the journey and expense. All those who go to Hajj, put off their clothes, garments and get into the simple traditional pilgrimâs white dress that eradicates all distinction of race or class. Furthermore, the person who adorns the required attire get liberated from the egotistic preoccupations of their daily lives. They all cry out in unison, âHere I am at your service O Allahâ; and then start to circumambulate around the Kaâaba (the holiest shrine in Islam) seven times, along with multitudes (almost tens of thousands at a time, the total being more than 3 million). Ali Shariati, the late Iranian sociologist of religion described his experience succinctly. âAs you circumambulate and move closer to Kaâaba, you feel like a small stream merging with a big river. Carried by a wave you lose touch with the ground. As you approach the center, the pressure of the crowd squeezes you so hard that you are given a new life. You are now part of the people, you are now a man, alive and eternalâ¦ You have become part of this universal system.

The first time he was on parental leave, he had plans to renovate the house, but soon had to realise that he hardly had time left for his daily shower. He is the son of Helge, the hands-on father in the middle generation who did not want to âmarry a housekeeperâ, but who later felt deceived by the Womenâs Movement. Henrik, however, saw his mother as a positive and competent person, who, he says, also had good looks. He believes that he has always been more in favour of gender equality than most girls and refers to the influence of his feminist mother. He gets irritated by women who do not fulfil their potential or do not dare to âgo for itââor who think they have to become unfeminine to do so. He likes beautiful women with the capacity to make their own choices. At 40 he has experienced that life is more complicated than in his motherâs feminist agenda. He appreciates sexual difference, but also thinks that individual differences are often more salient than gender differences. Today he feels somewhat estranged from the whole concept of gender equality, but emphasises that he certainly needs âno moral lecture on gender equalityâ. He believes in diversity, has organised courses at work about it and thinks that diversity also is key to economic growth. Henrik, who is among the most genderradical men in the youngest generation, combines a positive relationship with his mother with having had a hands-on father. In his case, however, the demands of a high-powered jobâand how important this job is to himâwork counter to the full gender equality he feels committed to. Old melodies interfere when âthe going gets toughâ, and it was his career that brought the family abroad, not his wifeâs.

It is as if knowledge of desire and sex has replaced the sensation itself, in just the same way as knowledge about texts and about reading had replaced the pleasure of the actual experience. Their dependence upon a scientific vocabulary and mode of knowledge to understand desire has squeezed out the feeling associated with it. Desire is the subversive element that cannot be contained by intellectualising scientific constructions of it. As Roland observes, âI think all the looking-into has some very odd effects on desireâ (267).13 He and Maud are left with an absence of desire, or, more accurately, a desire for absence. Their identical wish is âto have nothing. An empty clean bed. I have this image of a clean empty bed in a clean empty room, where nothing is asked or to be askedâ (267). Roland and Maudâs romance develops in silence, as if their vocabulary, so loquacious for dealing with matters of sex and sexuality, cannot find the words to express their feeling for each other: âthey took to silence. They touched each other without comment and without progression. A hand on a hand, a clothed arm, resting on an arm. An ankle overlapping an ankle, as they sat on a beach, and not removedâ (423). The language they use to describe sex and sexuality, and the ideological construct that stands for love, is characterised by what is almost violence. Roland, and especially Maud, guard their solitude, their autonomous selves, jealously, and do not wish to sacrifice this to the other. They associate love with sex, and sex with being a possession. It is this that they resist: it was important to both of them that the touching should not proceed to any kind of fierceness or deliberate embrace. They felt that in some way this stately peacefulness of unacknowledged contact gave back their sense of their separate lives inside their separate skins. Speech, the kind of speech they knew, would have undone it â¦ (424) Unable to speak their love, their gradual willingness to relinquish selfpossession and open themselves to the other is signified by the scene in which Roland convinces Maud to let down her hair. Maudâs long, blonde hair, worn tightly wound up and concealed beneath a scarf, is symbolic of her autonomy and independence. The passage in which she unravels it is figured as a kind of answer to the feminist poem that LaMotte had written a hundred or more years earlier. Angered by Ash, LaMotte rewrites the Rapunzel fairytale, replacing the prince who climbs to Rapunzel with a hairy ogre whose âblack claws go clutching / Hand over Hand / What Pain goes thrilling/ Through every strand!â (35)."
13,195,0.944,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Compared to the idealisation of female care and the gratitude expressed by the men towards their wives, the silence on these matters from the women we have interviewed is more than striking. They seem to share the view that they, as women, had the main responsibility for home and family, and with no public childcare available, they did not have much choice in the matter. They tried to be more caring mothers to their children than their own hardworking mothers had been, for instance, by having fewer children, more time for them and being less strict. In this way they are clearly complicit in creating the new family model, but they definitely do not describe it as âa golden ageâ Lorentzen (2012: 79) like the men do. They idealise neither their own nor their husbandsâ contributions. Hardly any of the women express the kind of admiration for menâs efforts as providers or their own husbandsâ personal qualifications as the men do towards their wives. If the refined gender complementarity was given as a gift of love from the men in this generation, it does not appear to have been received as that. The idealisation of gender complementarity belongs to the men; the women made the best they could out of it. Maybe the womenâs small critical remarks of the asymmetries in the gender complementarity model gradually fizzled out? The times were definitely on the menâs side in a period where it was both ideologically and economically arranged for married women to stay at home. The women adjusted to realities and also complied through their sensible choice of marriage partners and because of the benefits they gained. For many women of this generation, marriage and establishing your own home was the main route to freedom and independence from their parents.

57,172,0.944,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","arChIvIng our TransCrIpTs As we explained in our introduction to this chapter, recent European policy initiatives aim to create a ânetwork of networksâ of digital data repositories. It is still quite unclear at what point a researcher would be expected to place data in a digital repository, and to what extent access would indeed be open to all. The notion in a recent policy paper that all data should be available to all, in all phases of the research cycle (Joint Policy Paper 2017) reflects a poor understanding of how scientists work, and governmental overreach in terms of transforming their ways of working. Nonetheless, social science researchers in Europe may soon come under institutional pressure to comply with mandatory data storage in digital repositories. Open access repositories are subject to exactly the same objections as the DA-RT and JETS initiatives, specifically but not exclusively from the perspective of the authoritarian field, so we need not rehearse our arguments here. But we want to go a step further and state our objections even to digital repositories with restricted and/or embargoed access. Again, our primary objection concerns risk to respondents. As Marc Lynch points out, âthe difficulty of guaranteeing confidentiality for materials deposited in a trusted repository are not hypothetical to those of us who conduct research in the Middle East and North Africaâ (Lynch 2016, 37), and the same is true for other authoritarian contexts. We discern three aspects to this risk of breaching confidentiality, and hence risking harm: political contingency, legal risk, and digital risk. The first aspect relates to the apparently very"

Adding constraint 6 would ensure that there is only one such tree per model. We focus first on models which are pastwards connected. One interesting observation is that if, in such models, we take the histories as correlates of possible worlds, we find that to determine whether two individuals appearing in different histories within a single model are or are not identical, we need only trace them back in time to see whether they have a common origin at some moment included in both the histories. So provided we are able to trace identity back through time, we get a natural solution to what would have been the problem of trans-world identity but which is now recast as the non-problem of trans-history identity. But from another point of view, because the various histories in a branching time model are all connected it is reasonable to consider, as Belnap does, that the entirety of the structure in one pastwards-connected branching time model represents âour worldâ. Such a model depicts a world rich with internal possibilities, past and present, and rich with alternative histories, each of them a possible history of the actual world, rather than an actual7 history of a different possible world. 7 Actual according to an indexical understanding of that notion, that is."

Whereas Cantor initially seems self-composed but gradually âcomes ungluedâ, as Paula Curry phrases it, Jerry Stafford increasingly manages to pull himself together and recover his integrity. Initially there is an embarrassing tension between his actual practice (the sloppiness of his research, his notebooks, etc.: the context of discovery) and the exacting expectations of Cantor as his super-ego. The latter is not really interested in the actual work conducted by Stafford, he is focussed on the results (the surplus value, in Marxist terms), but when the Harvard lab fails to replicate the experiment, he decides to photocopy and xerox Staffordâs notebook to Krauss. For Cantor, there is nothing improper in copying Staffordâs notebooks, because a scientistâs laboratory journal is not a personal diary, but rather intended for inspection by others on demand. But as he himself examines Staffordâs notebooks just before sending them off, he is disconcerted by what he finds in them, or rather: by what he does not find in them, for the actual details are surprisingly scant (p. 86). Too much is missing. Therefore he refrains from sharing them with Krauss (realising that he failed as a supervisor) and decides that they should do an experiment together, so that he can monitor Staffordâs doings, and supervise him in situ (as an embodied conscience): Weâll repeat your [sic!] experiment togetherâ¦ In my private labâ¦ Everything will be under controlâ¦ A minor but crucial experimental variable must be responsibleâ¦Youâll do every step in my presenceâ¦Weâll find what was missing in the reportâ¦ Right into the lab and startâ¦ [Stafford] had now been ordered to repeat his spectacular experiment under the watchful eyes of the master (p. 92)."

However, E13 may have reflected a more general view by stating that âthe humanities havenât really cracked open the business sectorâ. In a more negative sense, this is confirmed by E4 who stated that her university âhas a knowledge transfer office, but its Director only considers translation in a neo-liberal way.

Itâs a specific policy of ours and itâs something that we have decided we want to do. And itâs also been influenced by the fact that these grants that Iâve been getting through the government system of these linkage grants, which are with industry partners, have proved to be so much more gettable and so much better value for money and so much more fluid in terms of open to open-minded research that we use that as a model in my particular institution as a desirable thing.

Thus, fairness is an important ethical and social value when it comes to sharing burdens required by the preservation of public goods. In the remainder of this section, I will explain in what sense fairness is an important ethical value; this explanation will clarify why fairness is not in conflict with the PLRA, when the PLRA is properly understood in the context of vaccination policies. In the next section, I will explain in what sense fairness is an important social value; this explanation will clarify why fairness is not in conflict with a principle of maximization of expected utility (which might seem obvious, but which some people have questioned). Now, as for its ethical aspect, I have said that there are reasons to prioritize fairness in the distribution of burdens over individual liberty in the formulation of vaccination policies. In other words, from an ethical point of view, fairness trumps liberty in the context of vaccination policies. Admittedly, the claim is controversial: Nozickian libertarians, for example, would claim that bodily autonomy is a fundamental liberty, and therefore the state is not justified in violating bodily autonomy to promote a good that is valuable for the community (for a discussion, see Navin 2015, p. 182). However, one might argue that there are reasons to reject this implication within a libertarian framework even if, as I have suggested above, we have reasons to reject Brennanâs appeal to the âclean handâ principle. As suggested by Navin, within a libertarian framework, the state is still justified in implementing coercive policies that infringe upon certain individual rights if such policies are necessary to prevent harm to others, because harm to othersâfor example, in the form of infectious diseasesâ does limit their liberty (Navin 2015, p. 182). But Navinâs argument is problematic: if my non-vaccination does not significantly increase the risk posed on others, especially when vaccination coverage is very high, how can libertarians consistently justify coercive vaccination policy, given that my non-vaccination would not significantly threaten other peopleâs liberty? The answer is that they cannot without also accepting that, in the case of collective harm, the harm principle does come with a fairness principle attached, as a matter of basic ethical requirement. Some libertarians might not accept that fairness plays this important role in policymakingâthough rejecting a fairness requirement would make it difficult to accept âsomething likeâ the clean hand principle. But their refusal to accept the fairness requirement in policymaking tells more about the low ethical standard"

Very different ideas of the stakes of the project, as well as the modes of investigation appropriate to it, run headlong into one another.

243,371,0.944,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"13.4.3 Engage Multiple Stakeholders The governing bodies and financing partners of sundhed.dk consist of members from Denmarkâs five regions, the Danish Regions, the Municipal Organization, and the Ministry of Health. This broad representation of key actors gave legitimacy to the portal at an early stage: âThe purpose was to establish a common public healthcare portal [â¦] that vision was crucial, and then of course it was important that they managed to engage the most influential partners, such as Danish Regions, that primarily runs sundhed.dk, together with the municipalities and the Ministry of Health as partnersâ (representative, The Ministry of Health). In addition, informants describe it as a clear advantage that the organization of the governing bodies resembles the way in which the remaining healthcare system is organized. For example, the relationship between the regions, the government, and GPs has been maintained through general agreements: âThe collaboration model we find in the Danish healthcare system is reflected in the organization of sundhed.dk. I believe that if we wouldnât have had this organization in place, it would have been very difficult to establish sundhed.dkâ (representative, the regions). The initial phase of sundhed.dk can be characterized as a political showcase for regional collaboration with solid political unity and common ambition. The involved parties have largely gathered around the common ambition of having one access point to the healthcare services: âAt the outset, there was a clear vision, which was politically anchored in the Association of County Councils â one entrance point to healthcare services and cross-sectorial collaboration â it was a vision we all could agree uponâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). In addition: âWe were told that if we could find a project that could strategically mark the 14 counties across, and not as silos, we would receive fundingâ (representative, the regions). In the initial phase, there was little disagreement concerning what should be offered to citizens and healthcare providers. The political unity and broad collaboration of stakeholders was described as key reasons for the success of the portal. While there was a clear political mandate and a broadly agreed-upon vision, the partners had different starting points in terms of already existing digital services. One of the initial challenges was to get everyone at the same level: âIt was a great opportunity to establish cross-sectorial collaboration, but this was also one of the biggest challenges [â¦] For example, not all regions had very advanced webpagesâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). In addition, it was a challenge to get everyone onboard: âIn the beginning, a lot of partners were happy about sundhed.dk and many believed in the overall vision. But if a region was working on a local project, it was difficult to get its buy-in. We spent much time in the beginning to go out locally and defend our existence. There was no choice for opting out. We basically told them that they themselves had decided that we should existâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). The engagement of multiple stakeholders did not come automatically but had to be enabled actively by the staff at sundhed.dk. It was important to engage actors, since sundhed.dk did not have any authoritative responsibility or obligations. The overall purpose was to make services available and to establish"
269,62,0.944,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"research that gets to the heart of the historical, theoretical, and conceptual frameworks of the science are, we suggest, rarer. FC recalls that both authors expended significant energy, over the course of many drafts, adjusting the wording so that it carried enough punch for the cultural theorist and historian, and enough nuance for the neuroscientist: in particular, the many (many) annotated drafts of the article reveal, for her at least, ongoing, shared anxieties about the politics of word choice; about how, or whether, normative claims might be made; and about if and how to include sentences that pointed to the future of the field. And yet despite these risks and efforts, co-authoring brought, for FC, significant pleasures. For a cultural theorist engaged with the history of science, the opportunity to co-author and publish in a scientific journal shifted her position of annunciation from the usual disciplinary one of external commentary to one of audible authority within a field. She surmised that for a neuroscientist, the opportunity to participate in meta-conjecture, and to intervene in the overarching frameworks and potential ontologies at work in oneâs own field, might offer a somewhat unusual, and yet potentially productive, intellectual position vis-Ã -vis one of the scientific objects that is the focus of much of his research. What collaborators cannot control, of course, is how they get read, or how they will be subsequently positioned against one another. At one stage in this process, FC followed up a shared invitation, to an interdisciplinary event, to ask whether it would be of interest to hear a linked presentation (from both FC and her neuroscientific collaborator) that included some reflection on how this cross-disciplinary partnership had developed. She received a warm reply â but one that warned her of the preponderance of âcutting-edge neuroscienceâ at the event, and thus likely scepticism about a talk that would go âtoo deeply into the genealogy of a fieldâ. Some historical context was welcome, she was told â but perhaps not too much. The key was not to work too hard at âreaching across the divideâ (between the sciences and the humanities), but simply to present cutting-edge (neuroscientific) work. Her respondent lamented, additionally, that humanists were sometimes âquite lazyâ and not up to speed with the science (this writer, we note, came from the humanities). There are many important points embedded here â not a few of which we are inclined to agree with. But what is especially fascinating is the way in which a concern about an ostentatious reaching across the divide ended up not only reinscribing an unequal dyad of science (cuttingedge, worthy of admiration, and excitement) and the humanities (that"

The QA, like any team member, tried to understand any possible flaws with the specification and make sure it was ready to be played. Before the team estimated the user story, it was common for the QA to discuss with the team a general idea of the strategy to test the user story, with special focus on the kind of automated regression tests that could be done. This helped the team estimate the user story with a bit more detail. This part of the process is still in use nowadays, as we feel it works well.

192,259,0.944,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In a self-reflective mood, during a conversation with Paula Curry, Cantor confesses that scientific research is not as straightforward as is sometimes suggested. Most scientists suffer from what he refers to as a âdissociative personalityâ (p. 113). On the one side, they are rigorous believers in the experimental method with its set of rules, bent on advancing knowledge (in other words: S2). On the other hand, they remain fallible human beings with all the accompanying emotional foibles (in other words: $). One of the gravest occupational hazards in science, moreover, is simultaneous discovery. Sooner or later, somebody else will have the same idea. Scientists are driven by one desire: recognition by their peers (the Krausses of this world), but in order to obtain recognition, priority is essential. To score a Nobel Prize, one has to be the first to reach the summit. Thus, the push for priority is enormous. And the only way to establish priority is to be the first to publish. In other words, due to the confrontation with arginine (the object a), the self-contained expert (S2) falls victim to disruptive desire, and this results in a split (Spaltung) between adherence to methodological safeguards (S2) and the desire to maintain his advantage, his momentum, so that Cantorâs eagerness to score ($) suddenly seems to overrule his impeccable technique. Krauss is Cantorâs scientific conscience or superego. If the experiment proves impossible to replicate, Krauss may accuse him of sloppiness, or even fabrication: âSurely he is not calling you a â. Paula stopped shortâ, p. 109). And once someoneâs credibility in science is damaged, it can never be repaired. The only option left to Cantor is to do the experiment himself, to become his own Servant as it were, and to design a second experimental test, climbing Everest by a different route (p. 116). Because he cannot trust Stafford anymore (p. 113), he has to take the experiment literally in his own hands, doffing his costume for a lab coat. It is only via working through that the methodological requirements and desire for recognition can be reconciled again. Various instances of self-reflection can be discerned on the epistemic level. In his Nobel speech, looking back on his experiences, Stafford suggests that the failure of the Harvard team to replicate the results was due to a procedural discrepancy that was âreally quite trivialâ, adding that âif there is one lesson to be learned from this experience, itâs that even the smallest details should be put in oneâs notebook â¦ You never know which details may turn out to be crucialâ (p. 198). This self-reflection not only concurs with the principles of experimental methodology, but also with the psychoanalytic rule that one should report any observations; that one should take care not to exclude any of them, for in principle nothing is irrelevantâ. Even seemingly trivial details (the bagatelle) may prove to be highly significant (Freud 1917/1940, p. 297). But in the novel, the role of the analyst, listening to the dialogues (the flow of university discourse) with evenly-poised attention, and from an oblique perspective, falls to Leah, the expert in Bachtinian analysis (p. 82). She is not at all interested in proteins, membranes or arginine, but rather in the grammar of biomolecular discourse. When challenged to share her observations (by Jean Ardley, Leahâs supervisor, who happens to visit them), she points to the remarkably role of the term âweâ in experimental discourse. Why do scientists always use the pluralis majestatis (âWe, scientistsâ, âWe, the authorsâ) when speaking about science? What is wrong"

Getting this keyboard handler and command processor working is an important milestone. Once you have it, you no longer need suffer the indignity of the control panel. Entering data from the keyboard is easier, faster, and classier. Of course, you still have the problem that all the code youâve entered disappears when you turn off the power. For that reason, youâll probably want to store all this new code in read-only memory, or ROM. In the early days of microprocessors such as the Intel 8080, it became possible to program ROM chips in the privacy of your home. Programmable read-only memory (PROM) chips are programmable only once. Erasable programmable readonly memory (EPROM) chips can be programmed and reprogrammed after being entirely erased by exposure to ultraviolet light. This ROM containing your keyboard handler would then occupy the address space beginning at 0000h formerly occupied by RAM. Youâd still keep the RAM, of course, but it would occupy a somewhat higher address in the memory space. The creation of the command processor is an important milestone not only because it provides a faster means to enter bytes into memory but also because the computer is now interactive. Once you have the command processor in ROM, you can start experimenting with writing data from memory to the disk drive and reading the data back into memory. Storing programs and data on the disk is much safer than storing them in RAM (where theyâll disappear if the power fails) and much more flexible than storing them in ROM. Eventually you might want to add some new commands to the command processor. For example, an S command might mean to Store some memory in a particular group of disk sectors, while the L command does a Load of the contents of those disk sectors into memory. Of course, youâll have to keep track of what youâre storing in which disk sectors. Youâll probably keep a pad and pencil handy for this purpose. And be careful: You canât just store some code located at one address and then later load it back into memory at another address and expect it to work. All the Jump and Call instructions will be wrong because they indicate the old addresses. Also, you might have a program thatâs longer than the sector size of your disk, so youâll need to store it in several sectors. Some sectors on the disk will already be occupied by other programs or data, so the free sectors available for storing a long program might not be consecutive on the disk. Eventually, you could decide that the manual clerical work involved in keeping track of where everything is stored on the disk is just too much. At this point, youâre ready for a file system. A file system is software that organizes data into files. A file is simply a collection of related data that occupies one or more sectors on the disk. Most importantly, each file is identified by a name that helps you remember"

What we termed translation (borrowing the word from medical practice) can exist in many different forms: working with museums to reach the public; going out to high schools; broadcasting on TV and radio; working with policy makers; and so on. No one can deny that there is a great deal of translation going on, and we gave examples of different types based on our own interviews and on national reports and other sources. But we also identified various obstacles to crossing the divide between the academic and the non-academic. One lies in academic culture itself. All too often translational activities are actually frowned upon by fellow researchers. We found evidence of such attitudes in countries as far apart as China and the Netherlands. In other countries the opposite is the case; in Russia and some parts of Latin America, the role of the public intellectual is alive and well. Indeed, some academics even wish the boundaries were sharper. But, aside from the attitudes of fellow academics, we found a more systemic problem in academic managers and institutional leaders failing to incentivise such work. It often goes unrewarded and so can inhibit career advancement. Even if it is actually respected, institutions may do little to facilitate the process of translation, and the lone researcher has to act as entrepreneur as well as academic researcher to bring his or her work to a wider audience. We are also aware of the dangers of encouraging translation in inappropriate ways. For example, we are not suggesting that institutional leaders should henceforth require applicants for project funding to build considerations of end use into the very framing of their proposals. Sometimes this may be appropriate, for instance a museum might commission research that will enable it to organise a particular exhibition for the benefit of the public. But it is often discoveries made in the disinterested pursuit of knowledge that result in the most important translation. So the ways of facilitating translation that we wish academic managers to find may typically come once research is well under way. We need to allow for serendipity; let humanists, like researchers in other fields, pursue their research on grounds of intellectual curiosity, without any explicit or conscious regard for what application or social value it may have. Our interest is in what happens when the results of the research turn out to be of immediate public interest or directly relevant to policy making. It needs to be possible for the researcher to cross"

I shall develop two new notions of validity, called weak and strong validity. They are variants of notions of valid arguments that have been proposed earlier,8 and will be shown to have distinct features that are especially important when it comes to compare valid arguments and BHK-proofs. At the end of the paper, I reflect upon the fact that all the variants of valid arguments considered so far deviate in one important respect from the intuitions connected with Gentzenâs approach as described above, and point to how the notion of justification may be developed in another way that stays closer to the original ideas."
82,296,0.944,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"The no starting point objection is also at the heart of Richard Fumertonâs âconceptual regress argumentâ against justificatory chains. On several occasions Fumerton has distinguished between two âregress argumentsâ in support of foundationalism: the epistemic and the conceptual regress argument.8 The first boils down to the finite mind objection against infinite chains. It states that âhaving a justified belief would entail having an infinite number of different justified beliefsâ while in fact âfinite minds cannot complete an infinite chain of reasoningâ.9 In the previous chapter we have explained why we think that this objection does not succeed. The conceptual regress argument, on the other hand, appears to be a rewording of the no starting point objection. Fumerton calls it âquite differentâ from the epistemic regress argument, and âmore fundamentalâ.10 It states that an infinite justificatory chain is vicious because we can only understand the concept of inferential justification if we accept that of noninferential justification: [I]f we are building the principle of inferential justification into an analysis of the very concept of justification, we have a more fundamental vicious conceptual regress to end. We need the concept of a noninferentially justified belief not only to end the epistemic regress but to provide a conceptual building block upon which we can understand all other sorts of justification. I would argue that the concept of noninferential justification is needed . . . in order to understand other sorts of justification . . . .11"

But then, differences between STIT and PDL tools may just amount to different legitimate decisions on how one individuates actions.11 The problem of individuating actions has been discussed extensively in philosophy (see footnote 3 on pg. 588 of Horty and Belnap (1995) for a concise explanation), and it also shows in modeling practice in computer science. This brings us to an important philosophical issue which we have thus far swept under the rug. In PDL models, actions are labels of transitions and this basic sorting of transitions by their labels seems to suggest a particular ontology of actions and events. In STIT models, there is no such sorting and, indeed, the only way to characterize an action is by reference to the outcomes. This raises an important question for the philosophical logician: Does adopting PDL as a logic of actions force one to take sides in philosophical debates about the ontology of events and actions? Our response is to bracket this question since we feel that both STIT and PDL models are open to a wide range of philosophical interpretations, regardless of the original intended interpretation of these logical frameworks. However, we certainly admit that this rather mathematical âformal modelingâ view is itself controversial and we welcome (and enjoy) debates on this issue. Nonetheless, we hope that the comparative points we are making in this chapter still make sense."

305,249,0.944,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"Feynman thought that one of the main applications of quantum computers would be to simulate quantum systems. Using quantum computers to study chemistry that belongs to the quantum world is a natural idea that has great potential. There are a number of areas where it is hoped that quantum computing will make important contributions. One of these is to understand how an enzyme, nitrogenase, used to make fertilizers actually works. The current method of producing fertilizers releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases and consumes considerable energy. Quantum computers could play a major role in understanding this and other catalytic reactions. There is a group at the University of Chicago that is looking into photosynthesis. The transfer of sunlight to chemical energy is a process that happens quickly and very efficiently. It is a quantum mechanical process. The long-term goal is to understand this process and then use it in photovoltaic cells. Superconductivity and magnetism are quantum mechanical phenomena. Quantum computers may help us understand them better. One goal is to develop superconductors that donât need to be cooled to near absolute zero. The actual construction of quantum computers is in its infancy, but even with a few qubits it is possible to begin studying chemistry. IBM recently simulated the molecule beryllium hydride (BeH2) on a seven-qubit quantum processor. This is a relatively small molecule with just three atoms. The simulation does not use the approximations that are used in the classical computational approach. However, since IBMâs processor uses just a few qubits, it is possible to simulate the quantum processor using a classical computer. Consequently, everything that can be done on this quantum processor can be done classically. However, as processors incorporate more qubits we get to the point where it is no longer possible to simulate them classically. We will soon be entering a new era when quantum simulations are beyond the power of any classical computer. Now that we have seen some of the possible applications, we will briefly survey some of the ways that are being used to build quantum computers. Hardware To actually make practical quantum computers you need to solve a number of problems, the most serious being decoherenceâthe problem of your"

As this happens, our wit and creativity in regard to life is once again stimulated, developing a movement for change that has already crossed over the chaos the materialistic focus, allowing us to let go of that while concentrating on life. The human spirit follows natural patterns between relaxation and stress, as we have seen in our medical research into heart rate variability. But our economy only follows the single pattern of relaxation and has no mechanism for stress other than its own collapse. To compensate for this, a dual economic system needs to be put in place, one of both transaction (relaxation) and transformation (stress), representing continuous interaction within a community that can keep it alive and progressive. The next comparison shows how the human body works and how the economy could work in the same manner."

In this section, we explain this conventionâs high-level approach, the security measures to be taken in a number of situations (motivating each separately with a summary table at the end). After that, we define a number of reusable macro-instructions that can be used to conveniently apply the proposed convention in subsequent examples. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we stick to a single, rather standard, C stack and register-passed stack and return pointers, much like a standard C calling convention. However, to prevent various ways of misusing this basic scheme, we put local capabilities to work and take a number of not-alwaysobvious safety measures. The safety measures are presented in terms of what we need to do to protect ourselves against an adversary, but this is only for presentation purposes as our code assumes no special status on the machine. In fact, an adversary can apply the same safety measures to protect themselves against us. In the next paragraphs, we will explain the issues to be considered in all the"

Thus, when it comes to saturation of man- objects, we are moving forward as I projected two decades ago in ChikyÅ« jizoku no gijutsu. In short, at present saturation is roughly being reached in developed countries.

We can no longer continue to talk about patient-centred care without a willingness to engage with all aspects of the person we support and care for including their physical, emotional, social, existential and spiritual needs. It is time to move away from a medical approach only to care in the HSCT setting to one of attending to the person. With nursing leadership and the reality of dying in the HSCT setting, there is no more urgent time to take forward the reality of person-centred care. Often the greatest gift we can give to those who are dying is our attention and presence. Amidst the uncertainty and the painful realities each person has to face, caring is often perceived as occurring when another person carries out a simple act of kindness with a caring attitude, which requires us to be attentive to them."

For comparing the efficiency of scalar versus vectorized code, we need a viz function as discussed in Sect. 2.3.5. All of this viz function can be reused, except the call to solver_function. This call lacks the parameter version, which we want to set to vectorized and scalar for our efficiency measurements. One solution is to copy the viz code from wave1D_u0 into wave1D_u0v.py and add a version argument to the solver_function call. Taking into account how much animation code we then duplicate, this is not a good idea. Alternatively, introducing the version argument in wave1D_u0.viz, so that this function can be imported into wave1D_u0v.py, is not a good solution either, since version has no meaning in that file. We need better ideas! Solution 1 Calling viz in wave1D_u0 with solver_function as our new solver in wave1D_u0v works fine, since this solver has version=âvectorizedâ as default value. The problem arises when we want to test version=âscalarâ. The simplest solution is then to use wave1D_u0.solver instead.

383,222,0.944,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"As we said earlier, the best way to visualise the risks is via plots that include both the central forecast path, as well as the prediction intervals.

Note, that the last figure is called a âfan chartâ, so it can be seen as a special case of prediction interval plots. Note, that Hyndman and Athanasopoulos ([34]) call the plots with prediction intervals as âVisualization of probabilistic forecastsâ. Example. Overseas visits. We used Overseas visits data and generated one-step-ahead prediction and prediction interval, as well as predictions with horizon up to h = 36 months, in Figure 3.24. What risks, opportunities and uncertainty we face after we did forecast from the time series? Several thoughts follow: â¢ Main uncertainty is that we do know if the forces that drove the time series in the past will remain the same in the future. What if government issues a regulation that will restrict the travel to UK and hence affect the number of overseas visits? We may not even know that such regulation can happen. We may not be able to estimate the probability of such a regulation. We may not be able to estimate the effect of such regulation on the total number of overseas visits. This is a situation of uncertainty about the model. There is always uncertainty about the model choice (e.g. linear regression or Holt-Winters or other) and its parameters being estimated. But if we have a sufficient number of data and if all the assumptions are satisfied (normality of errors etc) then we can say we reduced the uncertainty about the model. â¢ Let us assume that the future will be like the past (i.e. the forces that drove the time series will remain unchanged) and let us assume we have a good fitting model. Then we still face some degree of uncertainty, because there are random fluctuations that we cannot forecast. We can however"
360,187,0.944,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"I have argued that the way in which people interpret simple semantic rules such as relative clause modiï¬cation can be accurately modelled by a deeper analysis of the intensional meaning of the words. What is the evidence then that such intensions have the prototype structure that leads to the patterns of overextension seen above? If we consider most common content words in natural languageânouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbsâthen it is often the case that neither the extension nor the intension are easy to pin down. The meaning of function words like prepositions is even harder. Consider for example the following common uses of âonâ in English: (3) The cup is on the table. (4) I got paint on my shirt. (5) Harry is on holiday. (6) The train is on platform 2. Any attempt to deï¬ne the extension of situations to which âonâ applies is likely to end up simply as a disjunctive list of different cases. The fact that prepositions do not easily translate between languages supports this claim (Bowerman and Choi 2003a, b). When I told a French friend that I had travelled to Paris âsur le trainâ, the puzzled response was to ask if it wasnât very windy sitting on the roof. Similar problems arise with adjectives such as âfreshâ or âopenâ (Murphy and Andrew 1993), with multiple inter-related senses determined by context. For further discussion see Rice (1992). Returning to the (perhaps) simpler case of nouns, consider a simple everyday term such as âï¬shâ. First there is a potential ambiguity arising from the domain of discourse.

The exceptions included gender, which appeared in 13 responses, and identity, which appeared in 12.

For the purpose of looking at thematic patterns, let us now bunch these two together and look across the macro themes to ask: to what extent are humanities researchers connected to the societal concerns that surround them? How frequently did our respondents mention socially relevant research themes? A brief look at the topics listed under the heading of macro-themes suggests a social orientation in the research topics, which is borne out by a closer look.

13,318,0.944,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"a stronger polarisation in the youngest generation where some women experience greater success when it comes to disciplining themselves, since there is hardly any indifference involved. The polarisation is also quite striking when it comes to social background. None of the women from working-class families report a negative relationship with their bodies, and most of the ones with a positive body image are mother-identified and have a positive relationship with an attentive father. Stine describes how she showed off her new dresses in front of her father, since he was âthe only man in the houseâ. Reproductive and bodily femininity appears to be more threatening to middle-class girls. They also seem to receive more ambiguous messages from their parents, ranging from feminist celebrations of their first period to hints about watching their weight. Their relationship with their fathers is based on intellectual qualities than a positive evaluation of femininity. Perhaps it does not involve a direct devaluation of femininity, but rather neutralises its embodied aspects? The experience of gendered embodiment may therefore be a greater subjective obstacle for a father-identified girl than it is for a mother-identified boy. Feminine appearance is a demanding act of balance for a middle-class girl: not too little, not too much, and appropriate in time and place (see also AmbjÃ¶rnsson 2004). The more or less suspect femininity that a young middle-class girl has to avoid in order to become a modern, autonomous girl might also no longer be represented by her own mother in the way it was in the middle generation, but rather might be experienced as a more obscure, inner threat to her perceived identity. The body that is so central to modern self-construction has become a potential enemy, which they either manage to control or that lets them down by being beyond their control (Rudberg 1995). Thus, in spite of the young men taking a much more active interest in their appearance, there are only sparse signs that men and women in the youngest generation have become more similar to each other in the way they talk about and relate to their bodies. Among our informants, the ârisk groupâ with regard to anorexic tendencies seems to be fatheridentified athletic girls from the middle class, who hate becoming what one of them describes as âa proper femaleâ. At the same time, there is a female family heritage involved, sometimes going as far back as the grandmotherâs generation.

Certainly from such a (reductionist) perspective, it is absolutely necessary to remove access to the foodstuffs in question; however a care-giver may manage this. But, the patient is not simply diabetes mellitus, he is not simply this one disease. He is someone who has this disease: he is someone who is also much more than this, namely his entire body, and not only this body inasmuch as diabetes mellitus can be observed within it. He is someone who also has so much more, for example an attitude regarding his own illness. My patient couldâwith good reasonâinsist upon having a short, enjoyable life rather than a long one marked by deprivation It cannot be clearly decided, if I am to remain within this simple dichotomy, whether the shorter or the longer life is objectively preferable. Objectivity cannot be achieved here. One can argue with good reason in favour of the one option, and with equally good reason in favour of the other. In this situation, the care-giver, despite recourse to supervision and the necessary specialist knowledge and so on, is nevertheless faced with a very personal normative challenge. Furthermore, and this fact must be given recognition, he or she must be given leeway for this decision appropriate to the vagueness of the issue: the solution is not to prescribe one course of action or another, to demand either forced withdrawal or an ignoring of the consumption. It must be possible for the care-giver to make a decision as to the course of action, to create, maintain, improve or restore the patientâs well-being. I have stated firstly: nursing is a form of care. This means secondly: nursing is a form of care. It is one particular form of care, or to be more precise: nursing is a particular normative human reaction to the notorious frailty of oneâs neighbour. Nursing does not accept the (actuated) reality, as it is, as the best possible scenario, but rather attemptsâhealing, soothing, assistingâto make the best possible scenario (possibilitas)âI are painfully aware of the darkness surrounding this termâbecome reality (actualitas). This best possible scenario, always in terms of the patientâs needs, can materialise in divergent ways: perhaps in recovery, perhaps in a peaceful death, perhaps in something else."

In fact, he maintained that it is impossible to express clearly the way in which God knows future contingents. He also had to conclude that in general the divine knowledge about the contingent future is inaccessible. God is able to communicate the truth about the future to us, but if God reveals the truth about the future by means of unconditional statements, the future statements cannot be contingent anymore. Hence, Godâs unconditional foreknowledge regarding future contingents is in principle not revealed, whereas conditionals can be communicated to the prophets. Even so, that part of divine foreknowledge about future contingents which is not revealed must also be considered as true according to Ockham. Ockham was aware that the concept of communication was essential to this discussionâespecially, of course, the communication coming from God to human beings. He claimed that God can communicate the truth about the future to us. Nevertheless, according to Ockham divine knowledge regarding future contingents does not imply that they are necessary. As an example Ockham considered the prophecy of Jonah: âYet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrownâ [The Book of Jonah ch. 3 v. 4]. This prophecy was a communication from God about the future. Therefore, it might seem to follow that when this prophecy had been proclaimed the future destruction of Nineveh would be necessary.

The same is true for Brydenâs afï¬rmation that â[e]ach person with dementia is as worthy and precious as a beautiful newborn baby, a gift for us all to cherishâ (170). This view counters Spohrâs objectifying or Ernauxâs helpless use of the child metaphor; and it brings out how differently Bryden perceives of her situation as compared to Taylor. But it also illustrates how strongly metaphorical language relies on the context in which it develops.22 Brydenâs inferred emphasis on the patient as being the opportunity of growth and development reaches far beyond the perception of McGowinâs, Leeâs or, indeed, Taylorâs âstill being ableâ as counteracting the disabling notions of the child metaphor. Her conceptualisation of growth is necessarily linked to her retrospectively working through the illness experience, with the second chance giving her the opportunity to live out her gratitude. Such a reading adds to a positive reception of her narrative, as gratitude is considered an optimistic coping strategy in the confrontation with age-related decline.23 But Brydenâs linguistically suggested presence is only partially reï¬ected in the dynamics of her narrative that sets out to chronicle her frequent journeys to support DASNI and ADI, but then mutates into a collection of revised talks she had given during these trips. These essays relate â[w]hat it feels like to live with dementiaâ (97) or the âmany ways to helpâ (122), and, thus, excellently lend themselves to teaching good pharmaceutical care. Together with further information-containing appendices, these essays encompass over half of the book. Alluding to Taylorâs formal choices, this arrangement conï¬rms Brydenâs ongoing cognitive challenges, to which she, however, owns up very openly: It has been a tremendous struggle to collect together all my thoughts, talks, speeches, correspondence, notes and so on, for the last six years. Inspiration, rather than memory, has been the thread that enabled me to weave these disjointed fragments into this book. (173)"

Joyce is frustrated with Ceciliaâs constant reminders take her children to the Netherlands, feeling that Cecilia does not understand the hardship she is going through in the Netherlands. This lack of comprehension between the two women is augmented by the fact that Cecilia does not inform the migrant of the material resources that she puts into the care of the children whereby Joyce does not seem to fully realize the difficulties she is under and the fact that her remittances are not enough. This small, yet very significant difference in the two womenâs care networks helped to identify a discrepancy in how they perceive who is providing the material care for Ama and her four siblings and allowed us to investigate this more deeply, getting at some of the aspects explaining why this TCRA seems to be fraught with incomprehension and tensions on both sides."

326,148,0.944,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","tialist decision for the robot car â if all we care about is maximizing lives and minimizing deaths â is apparently to drive off the cliff and sacrifice the driver, since it is better that only one person should die rather than more than one, especially 10 or all 30 persons. This decision would likely be different if, instead of a school bus, your robot car were about to collide with another passenger car carrying only one person. Given the same average odds of death, one in three, the expected number of deaths in a collision would only be 0.67, while the expected number of deaths in driving off a cliff remains at one. In that case, the right consequentialist decision would be to allow the accident to occur, as long as the average odds of death are less than one in two. If, instead of another vehicle, your car were about to collide with a deer, then the decision to stay on the road, despite an ensuing accident, would be even more obvious insofar as we value a deerâs life less than a human life. Back to the school-bus scenario, programming an autonomous car with a consequentialist framework for ethics would seem to imply your sacrifice. But what is most striking about this case might not even be your death or the moral mathematics: if you were in a manually driven car today, driving off the cliff might still be the most ethical choice you could make, so perhaps you would choose certain death anyway, had you the time to consider the options. However, it is one thing for you to willingly make that decision of sacrifice yourself, and quite another matter for a machine to make that decision without your consent or foreknowledge that self-sacrifice was even a possibility. That is, there is an astonishing lack of transparency and therefore consent in such a grave decision, one of the most important that can be made about oneâs life â perhaps noble if voluntary, but criminal if not. Thus, reasonable ethical principles â e.g., aiming to save the greatest number of lives â can be stressed in the context of autonomous driving. An operator of an autonomous vehicle, rightly or not, may very well value his own life over that of everyone elseâs, even that of 29 others; or he may even explicitly reject consequentialism. Even if consequentialism is the best ethical theory and the carâs moral calculations are correct, the problem may not be with the ethics but with a lack of discussion about ethics. Industry, therefore, may do well to have such a discussion and set expectations with the public. Users â and news headlines â may likely be more forgiving if it is explained in advance that self-sacrifice may be a justified feature, not a bug."

299,426,0.944,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"difficult task. What can be done? One answer is for individuals to instruct the car they own or use to follow their value preferences. To a limited extent, this can be achieved through setting options. For instance, Tesla enables owners to set the distance their car maintains from the car in front of it (Gibbs 2015). However, data show that people tend not to engage in such decision-making if they must make more than a few choices. Numerous studies of human behavior, ranging from retirement contributions (see Beshears et al. 2009; Benartzi and Thaler 2013) to organ donations (Johnson and Goldstein 2003, pp. 1338â9) to consumer technology (Shah and Sandvig 2008) reveal that the majority of people will simply choose the default setting, even if the options available to them are straightforward and binary (e.g. opt-in versus opt-out). This is not to suggest that customization should be excluded but to acknowledge that it cannot take care of most of the personal choices that must be made. To proceed, we suggest that enhanced moral guidance to smart machines should draw on a new AI program that will âreadâ the ownerâs moral preferences and then instruct these machines to heed them. We call it an ethics bot. An ethics bot is an AI program that analyzes many thousands of items of information (not only information publicly available on the internet but also information gleaned from a personâs own computers) about the acts of a particular individual in order to determine that personâs moral preferences. Essentially, what ethics bots do for moral choices is rather similar to what many AI programs do for ferreting out consumer preferences and targeting advertising to them accordingly, except that in this case, the AI program is used to guide instruments that are owned and operated by the person, in line with their values, rather than by those of some marketing company or political campaign seeking to advance their own goals. For instance, an ethics bot may conclude that a person places high value on environmental protection if it finds that said person purchases recycled paper, drives a Prius, contributes to the Sierra Club, prefers local food, and never buys Styrofoam cups. It would then instruct that personâs driverless car to refuel using only environmentally friendly gas, to turn on the air conditioning only if the temperature is high, and to turn off the engine at stops. Note that this program does not seek to teach the car an ethical system that will allow it (and other smart machines) to deliberate and then form their own moral conclusions. Rather, it extracts specific ethical preferences from an owner and subsequently applies these preferences to the operations of the ownerâs machine. To illustrate: Nest constructed a very simple ethics bot, which has already been used by more than a million people. Nest built a smart thermostat which first âobservesâ the behavior of the people in their households for a week, noting their preferences on how cool or warm they want their home to be. The smart thermostat then uses a motion-detecting sensor to determine whether anyone is at home. When the house is empty, the smart thermostat enters into a high energy saving mode; when people are at home, the thermostat adjusts the temperature to fit their preferences. This thermostat clearly meets the two requirements of an ethics bot, albeit a very simple one: it assesses peopleâs preferences and imposes them on the controls of the heating and cooling system. One may ask what this has to do with social and moral values. This thermostat enables people with differing values to have the temperature settings they preferâto be either more environmentally conscious or less so (Lohr 2015)."
140,166,0.944,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Rummelâs work is an integrated worldview: its foundation is that the kind of government is of utmost importance to its own citizens (will our government kill us?) and other countries (will there be war?), so Rummel can by synthesized: regime type matters. This bridges the empirical democratic peace with a powerful prescription: if you want peace, and life, you must choose the regime type that protects it best: democracy. From this worldview comes one general principle, that democracy is a powerful and reliable method of nonviolence, and ï¬ve associated propositions, best set forth in Rummel (1997): ï¬rst, a pair of democracies do not make war on each other; second, the more democratic any two countries, the less their bilateral violence; and third, the more democratic a country, the fewer its own casualties in war. These are about international relations. The fourth is internal: the more democratic a country, the less internal political violence. Finally, the more democratic a country, the less its democide. Ending war and mass murder, and building positive peace, are the highest goals of secular life, and because Rummel offers empirically valid, theoretically sound, practical solutions to that end, I view Rummel as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. To understand this I have found Chadwickâs (2006) Goal-Drift-Actual framework invaluable. The GDA model centers on science, philosophy, and praxis, integrating political science (the empirical, what we know), political philosophy (theory, our understanding and convictions), and political action (what we do). The GDA is a powerful alternative to Johan Galtungâs Diagnosis-Prognosis-Therapy (DPT) model, which treats human interactions as illnesses to be cured. The GDA is less arrogant, lacking the DPTs presumptive privilege of the analyst as wise doctor, and from a power-limiting, freedom-favoring perspective, the GDA is a preferred model. Using the GDA to look at Rummelâs work we ï¬nd extensive political science in his robust empirical work that was essential to establish the democratic peace. There is highly developed political philosophy, from the âthe conflict helixâ (Rummel, 1991), to the three levels of explanation for democracy as a method of nonviolence (Rummel, 1997). Regarding praxis, Rummel argues that because of the science of the democratic peace, and the conviction that democracy reliably reduces violence, there is an imperative to âfoster freedom.â This integration, linked by regime type, offers a transformative politics, transcending realism and liberalism, while negating neither. For Rummel, realism must understand that democracies behave differently, and liberalism must understand that peace is best achieved among democracies."

Instead she establishes a scope of action or at least a scope of decision: Eli who had suffered from her dys-appearing body throughout the whole pregnancy is now taking the decision to give birth to her child. Similarly, Melanie asks her midwife if it would be normal that she was having headaches very frequently since she became pregnant. Instead of answering her question the midwife asks her what helped her when she had these headaches. âLemon oilâ. she answers. âWell, itâs great that you found something which helps youâ. Actually, Melanie had already adopted a strategy to get along with her headaches. Nevertheless, she felt insecure and needed support.

(1) Ï â§ [x]Â¬Ï is too strong (demands too much). For suppose there were another way in which agent a could cause the vase to fall: suppose that a could dislodge the vase by jolting the table (say). Now, suppose that a lifts its end of the table and the vase falls. That would be a transition of type falls; but falls â§ [a]Â¬falls is false in that transition since there is another transition, where a jolts instead of lifting, which also has falls true. So on that reading, a is not responsible for the vaseâs falling. The candidate form (2) Ï â§ âxâÂ¬Ï is more plausible but is too weak. Consider a version of the earlier vase example in which agent a moves the vase between in and out. Consider a transition in which a moves the vase to out and it rains, that is, a transition of type 1:(out â§ rain). It is a who moves the vase, no-one else. In that transition, Ea 1:(out â§ rain) is false because it is not necessary for what a does that 1:(out â§ rain): [a]1:(out â§ rain) is false because it might not have rained. However, had a acted differently (by not moving the vase) it might have been otherwise: 1:(out â§ rain) â§ âaâÂ¬1:(out â§ rain) is true. But that is too weak. By exactly the same argument, 1:rain â§ âaâÂ¬1:rain is also true in that transition: it rains, and had x acted differently, it might not have rained. Yet we would not want to say that agent a is reponsible for, or the cause of, or the one who brings about that it is raining. It is far from clear whether this weaker sense of âbrings it aboutâ or âresponsible forâ can be articulated using the available resources. The problem is that nearly everything we want to say about agency in practice is of this weaker form. If a man walks into a room, puts a loaded revolver in his mouth and blows his brains out, we would surely want to say that he killed himself, that he was responsible for his death, that it was his actions that caused it. Yet he did not see to it or bring it about: it was not necessary for what he did that he died. The gun might have jammed, the bullet might have hit a thick part of the skull, the resulting injury might not have been fatal for any number of reasons. And this has nothing to do with probabilities. If a man walks in a room, picks a bullet at random from a barrel containing live and blank ammunition, loads his revolver, spins the chamber, then pulls the trigger and blows his brains out, we would say that he killed himself, even though the likelihood that those actions result in death is very small."

In our study, for example, although the study participants have different profiles and personal experiences, some traits of culture can be typical of the Brazilian developers.

Secondly, these are highly educated men who emphasize the value of work-family balance rather than just their work life and personal careers. Thirdly, these are pro-active fathers who make an extra effort while on leave, in order to make sure they know how to do everything and more; this ties in with an ideal norm of individualized parenthood, where it is important not only to take everything on, but also to do everything in oneâs own way. In this profile therefore, in contrast to the previous profiles, we cannot say that it is âhome aloneâ leave that actually generates the discourse of gender deconstruction. However, the findings demonstrate that the period of leave allows these men to put their changing conceptions to the test, particularly as far as the interchangeability of fathers and mothers is concerned."

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"In other situations, left-behind family members are alerted by hostel management to the fact that their husband/father is sick in France and can no longer look after themselves in the hostel. In my discussions with Denis, a hostel manager, he mentioned that in the past managers were not required to ask residents for next-ofkin contact details. It is only recently, as head office began to grasp the extent of ageing and its consequences in the hostels, that recording such information has proved necessary. Thus relatives can be summoned from overseas to escort home a resident struggling with loss of autonomy â provided a visa can be secured, which is not always straightforward as some respondents mentioned (see Table 7.3). The final instance where returns may be constrained pertains to the individualâs social circle within the hostel itself. Instead of seeing their ailing compatriot sent to a retirement home â which is seen as shameful and even as reflecting badly on the hostel residents collectively (Sonacotra 2005a) â neighbours prefer to donate money to a collection fund in order to purchase a ticket to enable the man to return. âVery often, the fellow residents say to the elderly person, âlisten, you go home now; if it turns out OK you can come back, if not then you stay thereââ (BÃ©atrice, health advisor, migrant welfare association). An example of such a situation is found in the casefile in Table 7.2. The spareness and gravity of language by which the suffering of the individual in Table 7.2 is conveyed gives some insight, I think, into the institutional violence which is endemic and latent in hostel living. Such violence occurs, indeed seems inexorable, despite the good intentions of a number of actors. One can only speculate at the fate of this man.

We can interpret this as another example of inattentional blindness, discussed in chapter two, illustrated with the gorilla experiment (Simons & Chabris, 1999). Even here, the individuals involved seem to be blind to important aspects of what they are doing, and blind to that blindness. Moral fallibility is the name we can use for the phenomenon of acting contrary to oneâs moral convictions and beliefs. An individual may believe that adultery, tax avoidance, and nepotism somehow is morally wrong, but still engage in those activities, due to the weakness of will or some other explanation. Moral fallibility in organizations occurs when leaders or other employees make decisions and act in manners that appear to contradict what they generally take to be morally acceptable and right. A financial advisor may believe that he or she should put the clientsâ interest first, but still try to sell dubious products to them, to bolster personal bonuses. An athlete may consider doping to be morally wrong, but nevertheless take up an offer to use illegal substances to enhance performance. A waste management employee may be concerned about sustainability, and be a proponent of safe treatment of waste, but still let industry clients dump hazardous waste among the safe and recyclable waste. If there are real cases that fit these descriptions, they illustrate that people can actually go against their moral convictions, and be morally fallible. However, one widespread assumption in the field of moral psychology is that when we come up against alternatives that conflict with our moral beliefs, we will dismiss them unless we manage to convince ourselves that those alternatives are morally acceptable, after all (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, & Pastorelli, 1996). The main idea is that âpeople do not ordinarily engage in reprehensible conduct until they have justified to themselves the rightness of their actionsâ (Bandura et al., 1996, p. 365). When facing an option to act against our moral convictions, then, we will either dismiss the option or revise those convictions to be able to proceed with the option, without conflict. Rawls has described how individuals and groups seek âreflective equilibriumâ, a situation where there is coherence among our beliefs (Rawls, 1971).

Contemporarily, the evolved deï¬nitions of hate speech discussed are likely to be too radical for the general population to be regulated into law. Yet, the millennial generation show no explicit interest in legislation on three counts; 1. scepticism as to whether laws would be fairly enforced 2. a preference for community resistance 3. self-induced moral obligations to âstay wokeâ and reject hate speech are stronger than legal obligations. This raises wider questions surrounding tackling hate speech. A tendency to heavily rely on the law ignores the fact that juridical punishment often fails victims of hate speech, and provides no moral lesson for perpetrators. What the âwokeâ generation demonstrates is that tackling hate speech requires the work of communities to promote a moral obligation to treat one another with dignity, with a retrospective awareness of the historical origins of hate speech and âstructural violenceâ (Galtung 1969). With this grassroots or bottom up approach, law can be more trusted, and respected."

It collapses merely when we admit that causes may be only necessary but not sufficient for at least some events that matter to us in terms of our decision-making some of the time. Moreover, across a wide range of contemporary fields, including mathematics, computer science and physics, as well as economics, it appears increasingly clear that there are also events that just do not really have any cause at all [7, 8]. This ties in very closely with Keynesâ ontological notion of uncertainty."

These discussions were not actualised in the majority of sessions I observed because, as described above, the session positions were played out by the exemplary offender and the altruistic victim, and they agreed on the moral situation and role playing. In other words, if we would encourage discussions of norm-clariï¬cation, we have to create awareness of these powerful cultural discourses and narratives that guide us to repetition and reproduction. Whatever we do, we cannot wash the human brain clean of language and history (which would indeed create yet other problems); but that said, being more observant of our automatic ways of positioning others and ourselves could be a way forward towards creating more space for fruitful discussion, including the discussions of norm-clariï¬cation that Christie called for."
82,102,0.943,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"It might be true that more people are inclined to interpret (2.1) along the lines of internalism and evidentialism.43 Under that interpretation, Ai and A j are both beliefs or propositions, and P is construed as subjective or epistemic or logical probability. The point we want to make here is that (2.1) can just as easily be understood in accordance with externalism and relabilism. Under this interpretation, Ai and A j can be beliefs, perceptual appearances, memories, and so on. For example, if Ai is my belief in the proposition that a cow is grazing in front of me, and A j is my seeing a cow grazing in front of me, then (2.1) states that it is more likely that my belief in a grazing cow is true, given that I have this perception, than when I do not have this perception. Here P is an objective probability, depending on the frequency of events, where the events are âseeing a grazing cowâ and âbelieving that there is a grazing cowâ. Whether or not (2.1) holds here is determined by empirical research or, more generally, by past performance. Is it the case that my seeing a cow grazing is more often followed by a belief in a cow grazing than that my perception of a horse jumping is followed by a belief that a cow is grazing? The answer is presumably in the affirmative, so (2.1) is satisfied. The thing justified need not be a belief of which the probability is determined on the basis of perceptual appearances. It can also be the other way around. In cases of wishful thinking or of harbouring strong suspicions, my beliefs or my desires can cause in me certain perceptual appearances. Here the causal course runs in the opposite direction. Again, we determine empirically whether or not a causal process is in fact taking place, and thus whether or not (2.1) is satisfied: some people are more prone to wishful thinking or to being suspicious than others. It might happen that a causal process gives rise to a false belief. Optical illusions are a classic example. When I am walking in the desert, the refraction of light from the sky by heated air can cause me to believe that there is a sheet of water in front of me. This causal process is probabilistic (at some times I am more vulnerable to this optical illusion than at others), but it is assumed that (2.1) is fulfilled (I mostly fall prey to the illusion when walking in the desert). Goldman will presumably say that this is not a reliable beliefforming process, and that my belief that there is a sheet of water in front of me is not justified. As we will explain in the next section, however, we are not proposing to define justification as the condition of probabilistic support 43 Thus ReneÌ van Woudenberg and Ronald Meester have argued that âthe tradi-"
252,22,0.943,The Ethics of Vaccination,"precisely the ethical issues that this book aims to address. According to this type of explanation, the low rate of active vaccine refusal (e.g., in the form of applications for non-medical exemptions from vaccine mandates in the US) would be due not to the low number of anti-vaxxers, but to external pressures, including how difficult it is to obtain non-medical exemptions and state coercion. Whether such external pressures and state coercion are legitimate is precisely the question that raises the ethical issues that I want to address in this book, namely, whether there is an ethical obligation to vaccinate oneself or oneâs children and whether a certain degree of coercion, and what degree of coercion precisely, is ethically acceptable or even ethically required in the implementation of vaccination policies. One important aspect that Vanderslottâs reflection raises is that vaccination attitudes must be distinguished, with respect to their practical implications, from actual vaccination decisions. As already said, someone might be deeply opposed to vaccines for a number of possible reasons, but still decide to vaccinate their children for a number of different reasonsâ including the desire to avoid heavy penalties. Or someone could in principle be in favour of vaccines, or in any case convinced of their overall beneficial effects at the individual and at the collective level, but still decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children, for example because they think that it is safer or more convenient to free-ride on the herd immunity that other members of the community have realized. Now, what matters ethicallyâor at least this is the stance I will assume in this bookâis primarily vaccination decisions and only secondarily vaccination attitudes. Ethics provides people with certain types of reasonsâsuch as moral obligationsâto make certain decisions rather than others. And moral obligations exist regardless of whether peopleâs attitudes align or not with them. As suggested above, it would be ideal if individuals did vaccinate themselves or their children autonomously, because they were convinced of the benefits of vaccines and aware of the fact that vaccination is a moral obligation. However, ultimately, what matters the most is that individuals do vaccinate their children, whether or not they think that it is beneficial or morally required. Because vaccination actions matter more in ethical terms than vaccination attitudes, it is important to develop, alongside an ethics of vaccination decisions, an ethics of vaccination policies. Just as ethics in general is about how we should live and what we ought to do, and therefore about how we ought to make practical decisions, so an ethics of vaccination is ultimately about what individuals, collectives, and institutions ought to do with regard to vaccination decisionsâthat is, about what"

363,126,0.943,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"Yet this narrative both fits and does not fit. It captures some truth of their story, but not the whole of it. What is denied in this rendering of the story is their mutual pleasure in reciprocal possession; their joint delight in âtrusting minds which recognised each otherâ (501). Ash challenges her revision of their story, saying: âthink over what we did together and ask, where was the cruelty, where the coercion, where Christabel, the lack of love and respect for you, alike as a woman and as intellectual being?â (456). In her final letter to him, LaMotte acknowledges that although Ash threatened and ultimately destroyed her self-possession and solitude he did so âmeaning me nothing but goodâ (502). Her refusal to either contact Ash or tell him about their child, and her retreat into her pain and pride, is figured in the novel as a rejection of mutual possession, in favour of self-possession. It is symbolically rectified in the novel not only by LaMotte voluntarily seeking forgiveness and revealing the information that she withheld, but also by her relinquishing self-possession once more. And not only to Ash, but also to his wife: âI write under cover to your wife â who may read this, or do as she pleases with it â I am in her hands â but it is so dangerously sweet to speak out, after all these years â I trust myself to her and your goodwillâ (500). It is only as Ash nears death that she can again affirm âwe loved each other â for each other â only it was in the end for Maiaâ (502). Their child, born of those moments in which each found the centre of life in possession, each by the other, becomes a literal embodiment of the life that inheres in mutual possession. So, too, does their grandchild, who âis a strong boy, and will liveâ (503). Witnessing the life that has come of their relationship, LaMotte once again asserts the mutuality of their love, and can see Ash not in his role of usurper and despoiler, but as the man she has known, loved and been loved by. Byattâs Victorians, who believe in love and write and speak their own copiously, provide a contrast with her contemporary characters Roland and Maud. The sterility of the texts produced by the contemporary scholars is matched by the nullity of their sex lives. For Roland and Maud, love is something they theorise about, a âsuspect ideological constructâ in which they cannot believe in any personal way.

If the motive is good and the act is good, the person will be rewarded by God; however, if the act is good and the motive is bad, the person will be punished for it. There are many traditions to this effect. âDeeds and acts will be judged by the intention and motiveâ [9]. In another tradition the Prophet is reported to have said that the one who taught the Qurâan and religion would be dragged to Hell.

He advised her that she would not survive long in Kenya if she did not engage in this practice (assuming she was going to be working in Kenya). In this case, despite talking to the doctor concerned, we decided to move the student to another location. In another and more common case, staff asked students to purchase drugs ostensibly to treat sick patients. We are aware that whilst this may be legitimate in some cases, this is also a mechanism to fund drugs for sale or for use in their private practices.

188,408,0.943,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"in our organization is the very open culture regarding learning: we allow and encourage the learners to use our on-line resources during normal work-time.

For example the use of Wikiâs in companies is often very successful when coupled with reward systems . . . but they immediately die as soon as the rewards are taken away. The learning-tube philosophy is successful without any extrinsic rewards. Manuel Schmidt: We think that systems are successful when the intrinsic reward is obvious for the workers. For example, knowledge workers that have to train other workers are much more flexible when they create videos. The can reuse them in seminars or even refer to them during normal meetings. Interviewer: Do you track individual learners, their learning progress, . . .? Michael Werkle: This is not possible due to German privacy protection laws, and company level agreements. Interviewer: Currently the whole approach seems much centred on knowledge workersâworkers who do all their work in front of the computer screenâor at least on the knowledge working part of the job. Is there a planned integration of the factory floor learning processes into the system? For example when a worker explains to other workers how certain systems on the factory floor work, or how to make them work better, it cannot be captured by screen-casts. Michael Werkle: There are several research projects underway for humanmachine interaction. We are not sure yet which direction these projects will take. Manuel Schmidt: For me the question isâhow to integrate the LMS into the work environmentâor maybe not integrate it at all. For example, content could be attached to machines, and a learner equipped with technology like âgoogle glassâ could access this content directly in front of the machine, in a augmented reality setting. The goal will be âintegration into the normal work environmentâ. Interviewer: A very simple step, long before producing content for others is: taking notes for yourself in order to not forget. Learning material is produced for self-consumption. Are there any signs that the learning facilities inside Festo are used like this? To what extent? Manuel Schmidt: Our content creation process (for learning-tube, Ed.) is two-tiered. First the created content is saved locally, and only in a second step it is published. I know that some colleagues are using the system for personal notes. My personal estimation is that the ratio between published videos and local videosâconsisting of videos that the users are not happy with, and videos that the users created for self-consumptionâis about 1:10. Interviewer: In the conclusion of Chap. 7, it is mentioned that the search mechanisms inside videos are not yet thereâspecifically full text search is not working because not automatic translation of the spoken word to text is possible. Are there any new developments in this area? Manuel Schmidt: We tried to set up a project that tackles full-text search for videos with a semi-automatic approach: machine-translation and human lectors."

It also requires staff to have additional skills in the areas of communication and teaching to allow for effective cooperation and the exchange of knowledge, skills and capabilities in the workplace. This is the context within which the development of ethical educational placements is taking place. In the introduction we questioned whether it is possible for students to unproblematically become âculturally awareâ or develop âcultural competenceâ through merely participating in international placements. Practically all of the students mentioned culture, usually in relation to difference, in terms of different systems, ways of working and values. Our survey suggested that 78% and 18% of students respectively believed their placement had a very strong or strong impact on their cultural awareness. Returning to the discussion above about death, some students were able to reï¬ect on their experiences from the perspective of cultural differences rather than concluding simplistically that Ugandans lacked compassion. In the following case, the nursing student recognised the complex relationships between human emotions and outward displays of grief: The women, when they are having babies and in pain, they just get on with it. There was one woman who was basically just smiling at me the whole way through her labour, she looked so beautiful as well and I just thought oh my god! But then there was one baby who was going to die and when the mum was told she didnât show a massive amount of emotion.

125,45,0.943,"Charismatic Christianity in Finland, Norway, and Sweden : Case Studies in Historical and Contemporary Developments","As already mentioned, the first Pentecostal preacher in Norway was originally a Methodist minister. This is significant. The fact that he traveled to the United States in 1906 in order to ask for financial support from American Methodist congregations is also important, because it points to the strong relationships of economic dependence between congregations in the two countries. It also shows the results of earlier NorwegianâAmerican contact, whereby American-influenced migrants had introduced Methodism five decades earlier. The financial aim of Barrattâs mission was unsuccessful, as he returned without a penny; what he brought with him from America was inspirationâliterally speakingâfrom the Pentecostal revival he had encountered âover there.â In this sense, the story is emblematic because it shows how new and larger processes can be set in motion almost by chance, but it also demonstrates that the introduction of new revivals greatly depends on the history of previous movements and on social structures. Here was a Methodist pastor who unwittingly encountered Pentecostalismâs different but also familiar message. We may say that Methodism provided the background that prepared Barratt for his encounter with Pentecostalism. In a similar manner, his own ministry provided a bridge to Pentecostalism for many others. When he went back to Norway to spread the âgood news,â he preached to Methodist congregations in which he was already known. In other words, Methodism offered an organizational network of congregations which allowed him to preach and secured him an audience across the country. More importantly, Methodism provided the theological concepts (e.g., sanctification through the Holy Spirit), looser liturgical structures, and enthusiastic preachers needed in order to make sense of the new message. Religious change and innovation are complex processes, partly because religions often rely on exclusive notions. In a study of medieval Catholicism, Jean-Pierre Albert analyzes the process of making new saints. In order for a would-be saint to be recognized as holy, he argues, the new saint needs to tap into existing traditions and provide answers to present-day relevant questions, needs, and expectations. If a would-be saint fails to do so, he or she is regarded as either crazy or possessed (Albert 1997, 47â48). Inspired by Max Weberâs ideal type of âthe prophet,â Albert points out that wouldbe saints pop up all the time, but only a few of them are taken seriously and become foci of devotion. For this to happen, the saintâs new message must be better adapted to the existing social and emotional conditions of believers. The aspect of Albertâs study that pertains to religious change is useful to the analysis in this chapter, because it helps clarify the significance of Pentecostalism in the Norwegian context, and it will thus be applied in the present analysis."

378,99,0.943,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"Manfred Max-Neef developed a helpful tool to understand human needs that increases the creative imaginary space for sustainable innovations that target experienced utility and well-being. This popular Chilean development economist has called himself the âbarefoot economistâ after spending 12 years with the poorest communities in Latin America. His moment of revelation came when understanding that none of the mainstream market-based economic concepts were of any relevance to them. Much of his work has thus been built on proper empirical experience in non-marketized societies. It therefore provides some fascinating reflexive systemic insight into the effect that living with certain institutional setups has on the way actors see and experience the world. In an interview with Democracy Now! Max-Neef explained that his return to immersing himself in experience rather than deducing theoretical models made him conclude that we need an entirely new language in order to understand better what people really need. According to him, mainstream economics has nothing to say in support of the poorest people in the world if strategies are supposed to emerge from local systems rather than disrupting them. If you live in poverty, behaving like the selï¬sh, insatiable atomic accumulator of mainstream theory wonât get you very far, says Max-Neef: âYou cannot be an idiot if you want to survive; you need networks of cooperation and mutual aid.â In those communities, he observed, competition and the promise of monetary gain are not required for people to demonstrate enormous creativity, innovation and willingness to collaborate (Max-Neef 2010). To illustrate which fundamental human needs he observed instead, Max-Neef has developed a matrix whose key messages I summarized in Table 3.2. The matrix limits the number of existential human needs to approximately nine. He does not argue that the list of nine existential needs is deï¬nitive or set in stone, but he says he is conï¬dent that a change in those basic needs would at best occur at a very slow pace. Also, these needs should be understood as interrelated and without hierarchies, except for the need of subsistence or survival, which comes ï¬rst (Max-Neef 1992: 204â205). Here Max-Neef differs from other need-satisfaction approaches, many of which place self-actualization at the top and social, as well as material"
124,206,0.943,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"Each agent will correspond to a unique set of partitions of histories at choice points, and along any history, there will be a particular set of choices the agent makes and without which the agentâs life would not have followed that history. So from the point of view of that history, it will seem that the agentâs choices will have accumulated to make the agent the individual she has become. From this point of view, a simple version of existentialism seems vindicated. But it is more complex than that, because the choices of others also influence the history one takes, and therefore the subsequent choices with which one is faced. In the end, then, the individual one becomes is profoundly influenced by the choices of other agents, as well as by her own, and this is where the simple existentialist picture fails. And there is another layer of complexity added when we look beyond a single history. The totality of the agentâs choices throughout the Belnapian world is also uniquely associated with that agent, and reflective not merely of what the agent does become (along this history or that) but also of the agentâs potential, which we may consider is equally essential to their identity. At this scale we begin to see the agent as a unique collection of possibilities for action. When we survey this larger picture, balancing the agentâs tree of possibilities against the developments of those possibilities along a given history, we find a new perspective on the old nature/nurture debate: we need not choose between nature and nurture as the sources of oneâs character, and we must indeed add a third factorâwill. Nature has its role in providing our potential as seen in the treewide totality of the choices available to us; will has its role through our choices; nurture has its role in the choices of others which influence and limit our choices. Together they work, along any given history, to create a uniquely matured version of the agent, different from what they could have become had they not had that potential, different from what they would have become had they made different choices, and different from what they would have become had others chosen differently, as well. Another aspect of the focus on agency rather than on agents, as we have begun to see, is that there is nothing in the models for such systems that rules out the possibility that a given agent has been making choices throughout time, and will continue to make choices throughout time along each history. This is, of course out of keeping with the fact that the logic is intended to reflect the situation of mortal agents and agents who are not perpetually active. If we undertake the task of constructing a quantified logic of action we can expect to be able to remedy this situation, perhaps by introducing a distinguished predicate is alive into the language and making appropriate provisions for its interpretation in our models. The many quandaries associated with quantified alethic modal logic tend to make us shy away from a quantified logic of action (which could hardly present fewer such challenges) at least for the moment. But let us contemplate a slightly enhanced propositional logic of action and use this to get at least a preliminary look at some of the challenges involved in taking account of the finitude of agents. Suppose that in addition to the other more or less standard components of models for our logic of action we include a function Q (for quick, in the sense of alive)"
117,257,0.943,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Depersonalization Versus Care As demonstrated, there are a number of depersonalizing aspects stemming from regulation that should worry a caregiver. With this, I do not want to assert that regulation is intentionally drafted to generate depersonalizing effects. I do not want to claim either that seclusion leads to depersonalization in the sense that caregivers necessarily act in an inhumane way. What I do maintain, however, is that (wrongfully dealing with) certain aspects of regulation might unintentionally obscure care and that this might at least give the patient a feeling of being depersonalized (see, e.g. Meehan et al. 2004). The possibly depersonalizing effect of regulation stands out against the background of Trontoâs phased practice of care (Tronto 1993, pp. 100â126). First, care requires noticing the need to care [Caring About]. Regulation might distract caregivers from this need. A focus on dangerâthe patient must be undressed, observed and guardedâimplies deviating from the reason for a patientâs presence in the hospital, restoring the self. Legally, the moral element of attentiveness (needs) is reduced to alertness (danger) (Bowden 1997, pp. 113â114; Jacob and Holmes 2011; Tronto 1993, pp. 134â135). Second, caregivers must assume responsibility for the needs they have noticed [Taking Care Of ]. If a caregiver believes there is nothing to do about it, the patient is not taken care of.

On becoming pregnant, she procured an herbal abortion and disposed of the fetus in the school toilets. The babyâs ghost, Sheena said, would slam doors in the dormitory and afflict girls with seizures and fainting fits. One scary story led to another, and another. After giving the disclaimer, âI go to church and I donât believe in sanguma (witchcraft), but I will tell you this one story,â Sister Wange told us about the time she discovered that her brotherâs death had indeed been caused by a sanguma, a woman whose guilt was attested to by her âunusual pasinâ after the death. When the tutorâs story was done, Tina, who had grown up on the border between Okapa and Lufa districts, said in a hushed voice, âThese people here, in Ivingoi and nearby, they are the worst ones.â If the storytelling had started out as entertainment, things had now become very serious: Tina told us about things she and her relatives had witnessed that attested to the sorcerous pasin of the Fore. As I drifted off to sleep, well after midnight, the stories were still flowing. These stories of strange and supernatural violence were part of the atmosphere of anxiety that students struggled to contain during their stay. When the ban on work ended and students began their clinical practicum hours at the health sub-centre, they were alert to signs of âstrangenessâ in their clients. The odd young man staring fixedly at them as they worked? He could be mentally disabled or high on marijuana; but he could also be something else. A parturient woman from a distant hamlet laboring for hours with no improvement to her cervical dilation? After nearly a day of stalled labor, a male student asked her if there were any problems in her villageâan allusion to witchcraftâthat might be keeping her baby from being born. Even the revelations about kuru raised questions about the resilience of pasin tumbuna. When an older man in the village who had been a fieldworker for kuru scientists told a student about the disease, she had been so shocked that she drove back to Goroka over the weekend, went on the internet, and printed out copies of the Wikipedia page on the disease for her classmates to read. Since I was the only person from the college who had heard of kuru before the field trip, I was asked to explain certain things about it; namely, were they at any risk? Might there be prions in the soil, in the local animals and plants, or in the latrines? Had the Fore really"

Note that this implies that no local capabilities can be stored as part of a closure. We can then provide the adversary with an enter-capability covering the allocated block and pointing to the contained prelude instructions. However, the question that remains in this setup is: from where do we get a stack pointer when the callback is invoked? Our answer is that the adversary should provide it to us, just as we provide them with a stack pointer when we invoke their code. However, it is important that we do not just accept any capability as a stack pointer but check that it is safe to use. Specifically, we check that it is indeed an rwlx capability. Without this check, an adversary could potentially get control over our local stack frame during a subsequent callback by passing us a local rwx capability to a global data structure instead of a proper stack pointer and a global callback for our callback to invoke. If our local state contains no local capabilities, then, otherwise following our calling convention, the callback would not fail and the adversary could use a stored capability for the global data structure to access our local state. To prevent this from happening, we need to make sure the stack capability carries rwlx authority, since the system wide assumption then tells us that the adversary cannot have global capabilities to our local stack. Calling Convention. With the security measures introduced and motivated, let us summarize our proposed calling convention: At program start-up A local rwlx stack pointer resides in register rstk . No global write-local capabilities. Before returning to the adversary Clear non-return-value registers. Clear the part of the stack we had access to (not just the part we used). Before invoking the adversary Push activation record to the stack. Create return pointer as local e-capability to the instructions in the record. Restrict the stack capability to the unused part and clear it. Clear non-argument registers. Before invoking an adversary callback Make sure callback is global. When invoked by an adversary Make sure received stack pointer has permission rwlx. Reusable Macro Instructions. We define a number of reusable macros capturing the calling convention and other conveniences. All macros that use the stack assume a stack pointer in register rstk . The macro fetch r name fetches the capability related to name from the linking table and stores it in register r. The macros push r and pop r add and remove elements from the stack. The macro prepstk r is used when a callback is invoked by the adversary and prepares the received stack pointer by checking that it has permission rwlx. The macro scall r(rargs ,rpriv ) jumps to the capability in register r in the manner described above. That is, it pushes local state (the contents of registers rpriv ) and the activation record (return code, return pointer, stack pointer) to the stack, creates an e return pointer, restricts the stack pointer, clears the unused part of the stack, clears the necessary registers and jumps to r. Upon return, the private state is restored. The macro mclear r clears all the memory the capability in register r has authority over. The macro rclear regSet clears all the"

These phenomena are seen as central in Objectivist accounts, but which seem not to figure in most Subjectivist accounts. This holds, I think, not only for the psychological theories that postulate concepts to be tested against certain behavioural responses by language users (where these theories donât pretend to test a full range of linguistic phenomena), but also for the cognitive linguists who are very aware of many of the deep and peculiar intricacies of natural language but who nevertheless use the overly-simple results from the psychological theories to account for them. (Sometimes just assuming that âmore of the sameâ will accommodate the intricacies.) I write this from the point of view of an Objectivist, formal semanticist. All the topics discussed below are thought to be adequately dealt with on the Objectivist side of a two-tier theory (at least by Objectivists44 ). Presumably, Subjectivists would have their own lists of topics that Objectivists need to deal with before any two-tier account could be made to work. But someone else will have to provide that list."

We studied what other countries had done in similar situations, where they had succeeded, where they had failed, and what mistakes they had made along the way. We took what worked and adapted it to the new political reality and the speciï¬c local requirements in Georgia. Post-revolution Georgia was the rare case of a country tackling reforms in all areas: ï¬scal and monetary policies; welfare, healthcare, and education; and public accountability, security, and agriculture. Nothing was left out. What makes this case so rare is the fact that most governments initiate reforms in one or two areas but almost never across the board. This is due to the fact that most societies are not ready to embrace change on this scale. All things considered, we set out to build a modern state â not from scratch but from the ruins left by decades of corruption and neglect â 70 years of Soviet regime; Russian-led wars on the Georgian territory and a civil war in the post-Soviet 1990s; and corrupt and criminal governmentâs rule in late 1990s through early 2000s.

So even if the applicant is entitled to assume an afï¬rmative answer after the deadline expires, they will still lack the corresponding documentation. To ï¬x this, you need some sort of high-level authority that is entitled to issue the documentation in question. In Georgia, such an authority was not created. As a result, these incidents are handled by the courts, which have the power to force the respective agency to issue proper documentation with the required approval, although this power has never been exercised to date. â¢ Agencies still tend to come up with all sorts of irrelevant inquiries and questions to justify an extension of the deadline. This tendency undermines the entire âsilence is consentâ concept and lets the old regime of constant delays creep back in. We introduced speciï¬c regulation to keep such delays at bay. When an agency asks for additional information, which it is entitled to do only once according to the new rules, the clock restarts as soon as the missing information is supplied by the applicant. Thanks to âone governmentâ and âsilence is consent,â civil servants now think differently about how they provide services to the public. In the past, civil servants did not care how many different types of documents an applicant, be it a citizen or a company, had to submit to obtain a given license or permit, nor did they care how many different agencies the applicant had to deal with for a single application. After the reform, things changed. As one-stop service providers, civil servants were now responsible for collecting all required documents themselves, and inaction would lead to automatic approval of an application. Suddenly, ofï¬cials personally felt the pain of unnecessarily complex rules and regulations. Initially, they were still reluctant to introduce simpliï¬cations that would make one of their colleagues redundant, or simply reduce someoneâs perceived or actual authority and importance. But the new regulations (âsilence is consentâ and âone governmentâ principle), put together, made it clear that their own job security was contingent on their contribution to a more efï¬cient administration. Once civil servants realized that the role of government had changed, and that they could be ï¬red if they didnât play along, they started looking at rules and regulations from a new angle. Before, ofï¬cials treated citizens as petitioners. Now, the customer is king."
384,41,0.943,Practical Economics : Economic Transformation and Government Reform in Georgia 2004â2012,"Many developing countries today face similar challenges. Foreign governments and international ï¬nancial institutions press for the introduction of ever more complex rules and regulations, be it to increase their inï¬uence in the developing world, or out of sheer ignorance about potential side effects. Sometimes, the justiï¬cation for new regulation is as trivial as having something to show in return for ï¬nancial aid. But often, the only effect these new rules have is to engender corruption at the expense of struggling businesses and citizens. The lesson Georgia learned the hard way is that you cannot impose advanced regulations on a developing country in one fell swoop. In response, the government after 2004 has followed a simple set of guidelines when it came to regulation: â¢ The country is poor, and the government cannot afford to employ thousands of inspectors to oversee and enforce endless rules and regulations. â¢ In the past, the government itself and its agencies have been the most corrupt institutions, and at least some ofï¬cials will likely succumb to corruption again. â¢ In practice, most rules and regulations are not followed anyway. They do not contribute to the well-being of the population. All they do is cause corruption. â¢ So let us get rid of all non-essential regulations and simplify the remaining ones to minimize the potential for frustration, confusion, and corruption. â¢ As the country develops and the economy grows, let us introduce new regulation as it is needed and to the extent that we are able to enforce it. Following this line of reasoning, Georgiaâs regulatory framework was reduced to the immediate essentials: ï¬ghting corruption, protecting public safety, and collecting taxes. Step by step, we introduced new regulation as it became necessary, and only if we could realistically hope to enforce it. For example, wearing seatbelts in cars became obligatory in Georgia only in 2010. We had considered introducing this rule as early as 2005, but decided against it for two reasons: ï¬rstly, because there was no track record of playing by the rules at the time. We would only have created a new source of bribery for trafï¬c police ofï¬cers. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, because we had no way of enforcing such a rule at the time. In 2004, we had laid off the entire trafï¬c police force. In 2005, we"

And then you have to look at (â¦) how you can keep this going, without costing more money, but that you still grow.

Notably, Larryâs Way has always only been available as printon-demand â as are several other patient narratives I am referring to in this discussion. This fact tellingly discloses the publisherâs concern that the storyâs lack of coherence would not make it a big seller, and it conï¬rms that coherent narration contributes to the construction of a societally more valued self, on a personal and public level.20 Nevertheless, some texts perform the condition-enforced limits of expression, particularly in more advanced stages of the illness, while still serving the patientâs agenda.

Thus, reasonable ethical principlesâe.g., aiming to save the greatest number of livesâ can be stressed in the context of autonomous driving.

It did not lack care. Neither did I encounter insufficient or bad care. The carers did care, and most of them with sensitivity, rather than sentimentality. Nonetheless, the rising prevalence of chronic illnesses means that care is becoming an increasingly complex affair. It is with due regard for these actualities that we must construe the relationships between the village residents, the carers, dementia and social life. And I hope that by outlining some of these complexities, this paper will foster a deeper and more critical understanding of dementia, ageing and the care we all hope to receive in our twilight years."

186,2,0.942,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"As the editor-in-chief of a bioethics journal, the Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, I encounter the concept of dignity regularly and increasingly. I see many treatments of the subject, from efforts to resolve real-life moral dilemmas in health care to highly sophisticated theoretical pieces. More importantly, as a neuroethicist I work on end-of-life issues for those with decreasing mental faculties. The relevance of human dignity does not need explanation in this context. Or does it? Since Macklin (2003) argued in the British Medical Journal that dignity is a useless concept in bioethics, interest in the topic has increased signiï¬cantly, as have disagreements and disputes over the meaning of âdignityâ. The idea of conceptualising the topic around the Middle East and West divide is both unique and insightful. It is especially welcome in this time of tensions between the two regions, which inï¬ltrate many areas of our lives. Doris Schroeder is one of the contemporary bioethicists whose work I most admire. Not only is it consistently well written and clearly argued, but it addresses topics that really matter in the lives of people. Most often she gives a voice to vulnerable populations that are too rarely represented in philosophical discussions. Doris is a philosopher who works in the world and is not conï¬ned to an ivory tower. She is one of fewer than half a dozen bioethicists writing today whose work I would seek out on any subject. Until now, I have only been familiar with Bani-Sadr as a political ï¬gure in the Middle East. I know of his active part in the anti-Shah student movement in the early 1960s, and his later association with Ayatollah Khomeini that led to his installation as the ï¬rst President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ending with his dismissal when he broke with the cleric. Bani-Sadrâs standing as a learned scholar of the Koran and his outspoken criticism of violent regimes make him a uniquely qualiï¬ed commentator, not only on the meaning of dignity in the Islamic tradition, but also on the consequences when power trumps dignity in the current political climate. I was surprised and riveted by his personal memories from the Iran-Iraq"

However, in fulfilling its moral duty to protect vulnerable peopleâs health, a state is not morally justified in doing just anything in its power; for example, to go back to infectious diseases, a state is normally not morally justified in quarantining individuals with measles or the flu in order to prevent other individuals from being infected. What, then, ought a state to do in order to protect vulnerable people from vaccine infectious diseases by remaining within its ethical boundaries? What are the limits of a stateâs moral obligation to protect the health of a community? Questions about what a state ought to do are inseparable from questions about what a state may permissibly do in order to fulfil its moral obligation. From what I have said so far, a state may permissibly fulfil its moral responsibility to protect individual and public health by requiring individuals to fulfil their individual moral obligations; for example, since vaccination is an individual moral obligation, as I have argued in this chapter, the state is justified in requesting individuals to be vaccinated in order to realize herd immunity, given that by doing so the state would not be requesting individuals to do anything supererogatory. Besides, state policies aimed at realizing herd immunity are further justified by the fact that individuals have a moral obligation to support such policies. Thus, the argument I have provided suggests that a state has a moral obligation to at least ensure that herd immunity is realized within its jurisdiction. Such institutional obligation results from the combination of a moral duty to protect vulnerable individualsâ health and the ethical acceptability of vaccination policies that individuals have a moral obligation to support."
117,105,0.942,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"of autonomy is needed. On the one hand, this account must understand will-formation as a process that is guided by ethical reasons. On the other hand, this must be an open process in which certain solutions cannot be flagged as right or wrong without a deliberative, intersubjective exchange. Such an exchange should be held together by a justified sense of having a shared aim, but, at the same time, it must be assumed that right and wrong cannot be inferred from this shared aim without intersubjective deliberation. Kantâs use of the criterion of universalisability points in a different direction. The way in which he treats the question of whether it is ethically justified to take oneâs life if oneâs future life does not appear to be worth living is a case in point. He does not imagine this to be a weighing of multiple points of view or a process involving intersubjective social support. Rather he assumes that individually applying the test of universalisability inevitably leads to the conclusion that suicide is not ethically allowed. In other words, the shared aim of acting in accordance with the test of universalisability does not leave room for interpretation or different forms of concretisation in specific contexts as part of a process of intersubjective reason-guided communication. What is more, critics have pointed out that contrary to Kantâs own supposition, planned actions cannot be ethically justified or prohibited on the basis of the criterion of universalisability. These critics claim that Kant relies on implicit hidden assumptions that render planned actions non-universalisable. Therefore, the criterion of universalisability as such is empty. To take the two examples given above, someone who is willing to accept that he will not receive help in cases where he might need it might not see any contradiction if his preference not to help others were universalised. In the same vein, it can be argued that the assumed fact that a preference for suicide, if universalised, undermines the possibility of there being any wills is only a contradiction if one regards the existence of wills as undoubtedly desirable.2 It might be possible to save Kant from this criticism and perhaps also to develop an interpretation of his theory that can resolve the autonomy dilemma.3 However, since there are other philosophical accounts of autonomous will-formation that are better suited to resolve this dilemma from the start, it makes sense to turn to these approaches instead."

In this paper, we use a developer-oriented statistical approach to understand what causes people in complex software development networks to decide to fork (break away), and what changes a community goes through in the run-up to a decision to break-up. Developing complex software systems is complex. Software developers interact. They may have the same or different goals, communication styles, or values. Interactions can be healthy or troubled. Troubled interactions cause troubled communities, that face failure. Some of these failures manifest themselves as a community split (known as forking). These failures affects many people; developers and users. Can we save troubled projects? We statistically model the longitudinal socio-grams of software developers and present early indicators and warning signs that can be used to predict an imminent break-up decision."
118,344,0.942,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Developing a framework for a Cultural Risk Analysis, i.e. to carry out a cultural analysis, requires a paradigmatic shift in human consciousness similar to the one that took place in the Enlightenment. And this will be extremely difficult because it is a shift requiring both the rational (cognition) and the emotional (feeling). It will require both risk-as-analysis and risk-as-feelings; it will require both moral reasoning and emotional morals. As any good engineer knows (at least those who have taken my class), a redundant and diverse system has order of magnitude higher reliability if the system is built of âANDâ gates rather than âORâ gates.21 Perhaps Thomas Kuhn [34] said it best, ââ¦that is why a law that cannot even be demonstrated to one group of scientists may occasionally seem intuitive to others. Equally, it is why, before they can hope to communicate fully, one group or the other must experience the conversion we have been calling a paradigm shift.â And, âJust because it (a paradigm shift) is a transition between incommensurables, the transition between competing paradigms cannot be made a step at a time, forced by logic and neutral experience. Like the gestalt switch, it must occur all at once (though not necessarily in an instant) or not at all.â"

In order to illustrate the attitude of these rapporteurs, it is worth giving a brief account of our attempts to establish contact with them and obtain information on the immigrants living in the districts. We sent out test e-mails to each of the 22 rapporteurs in which we inquired about the number and nationality of immigrant groups living in the districts. Eight answers arrived, five of which contained no information about immigrants. One of our interviewees, who is a member of the local government envisioned a very dark future by showing his highly oversimplified and stereotypical opinion on the Chinese, saying that they are harmful in taking away jobs from the Hungarians, cheating on taxes, and forcing the Hungarians out of their own country by developing their own institutions. When we asked him why, if this is such a problem, the municipality does not take care of it, we heard another representative of the local government behind us laugh and say âWhat could we do about this?

Under such extreme conditions, traditional black body radiation no longer remains, but rather the conditions are found akin to the high-energy collisions of nucleons. And then when strongly interacting matter is present the temperature cannot be infinite, but only about 1012 K, and the pressure is not anymore proportional to the energy density but only proportional to its logarithm. This is a different scenario of the beginning of the Universe than was previously thought. A beginning is seen in experiments at CERN, where a proton melts with another for 10 23 s into boiling primordial matter. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that even entire stars consist of boiling primordial matter. We can wonder if this Big Bang, the origin of everything, including the beginning of time is an equally unsatisfactory assumption as is the existence of the very final building blocks of matter. Just as you can ask: and how did that building block come about?, so you can ask: and what was before Big Bang? How did it happen? We do not know. Maybe we will find one day that this question in a similar way is irrelevant asâpossiblyâthe one about the final building blocks.

One caseworker argued that âIt may not be a case for the legal system, but there is something in the family which they need help withâ (Interview 7). Another caseworker said âOur goal is to help this child. The Barnahus can help us [if the police is contacted], but sometimes the best thing is not to press chargesâ (Interview 5). The predicament is that according to the legislation establishing Barnahus, a Barnahus cannot get involved if there is only one public agency involved in the case. If the child welfare services do not involve the police (which is the second public agency in most cases), the case cannot involve Barnahus. This again means that the child welfare services in the municipalities do not have access to the expertise offered in Barnahus, and this becomes an unintended effect of this predicament. Sometimes, the child welfare services would like to obtain guidance, assistance and psychological treatment in cases that they see as being in a grey zone, cases that should not be tried in a court of law, but where a child shows signs of failure to thrive and the municipality has to deal with the family. This poses a dilemma which is related to the opposition between holism and the reductionism of specialised knowledge. On the one hand, the child welfare services appreciate the opportunity to receive assistance from experts with knowledge about child abuse. On the other hand, the legal framework of Barnahus states that it is necessary to involve the police or health services in order to involve Barnahus in the case. Involving the police is often very important, but in some cases, the child welfare caseworkers found that involving the police and engaging with all the legal issues of interrogation was the wrong way to deal with a particular child and the childâs family. It is against the law to hit your child, but should the police be contacted when a child says something or only when the child has bruises, because then the police has evidence? Or should the police be contacted because you think it will help the child if the parents are punished? Sometimes when I contact the police, they are also in doubt (Interview 5)."

Birzer was in despair: âDearest mother, I cannot stand it any more, if it were not for you I would take my own lifeâ (ibid., 280).

113,399,0.942,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"for all sorts of explanations, that is important for understanding the resilience of these shifting imaginaries on occult forces, and their capacity to graft themselves upon incisive changes. In Pypeâs study on Kinshasa, these hidden forces invade new technologies; Eriksen and Rio show that objects from Africa can suddenly become central to horror stories in Port Vila; for Thomas Strong witches in Papua New Guinea evoke jealousy because of their âordered modernity.â For Koen Stroeken such volatility seems to be a deplorable effect of modern changesâlike the impact of Pentecostal missionary zealâdestroying fine-grained distinctions ordering local society. In my experience, this diffuseness and chameleonic capacities are rather given with basic trends in the discourse on occult powers. The central concern in many âwitchcraftâ discourses with dramatic, nightly confrontations place a premium on novel borrowings that can surprise adversaries. Hence their basically unstable and shifting character and a basic ambiguity on what is good and evil: the nganga as a healer can always be suspected to turn into a witch. The idea that the same power that can heal can also kill, returns in a wide range of settings. Or, to be more concrete, nganga may be healers for their clients, but the witch they attack will claim to be an innocent victim of healers who are themselves witches. Such shifts are also crucial in the interaction of these ideas with Pentecostalism. To these preachers the âtraditional healerâ is, of course, a witchâno doubt about thatâbut this certainty is constantly being undermined by the basic ambiguity of local ideas. As many of the Ghanaian and Nigerian video-films, deeply marked by the Pentecostal message, highlight: the treason may be insideâthe most fervent crusader can turn out to be a source of evil (Meyer 2015). It is the shifting character of these imaginaries, marked by deep ambiguities and uncertainties, that make them so resilient despite deep changes. All this to argue that Knut Myhreâs plea for allowing âvernacular actions to act on our [academic] practices and our representational powersâ is highly sympathetic but raises also serious dilemmas. It certainly raises enticing perspectives: it is vital not to lose touch with peopleâs ways of seeing things or to try to reduce these to another, more ârealâ reality. But it raises also a basic dilemma for us academics. One of the first principles of academia is that we must create clarity, working as much as we can with unequivocal notions. But how to deal then with forms of knowledge that get their power precisely from their un-clarity and their ambiguity? How can we avoid that our efforts to create clarity abscond the very power we are trying to understand? Taussigâs solution"

All the same, going to this enormous trouble supports the notion that such writing is to be taken seriously in its exceptionality, especially since the few voices that come to articulate their concerns are the ones advocating for the community of their fellow sufferers, who remain silent.7 As I emphasised previously, I believe that patient accounts deserve particular attention, given the tension between current health and social care policies, on the one hand, and the core issues that these patients are crucially concerned with, on the other hand: the medication of their cognitive decline, a working doctorâpatient relationship or, as in Graboysâs case, end-of-life questions.8 On an aesthetic level, however, collaborative composition makes it difï¬cult to rely on stylistic choices for getting to grips with Leeâs perception of her condition.

275,348,0.942,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"12.2 Compatible and Incompatible States The conjunction fallacy does not mean that people always judge the probability of a conjunction as higher than each of its conjuncts. That would indeed be counter to probability theory. Just imagine that the choice between (a) and (b) was presented without the story about Linda. Then one would expect everyone with some notion of probability to choose (a) over (b), as confirmed in [35]. But when asked the question after first hearing the story, even people schooled in statistics fall victim to the conjunction fallacy. Why is this? The question generated a host of publications with possible explanations over the last several decades (see [19] for an overview). Among the many kinds of explanations offered, two stand out in particular. One assumes that words such as âandâ and âprobabilityâ are misunderstood by the participants, or at least not understood in their formal interpretation. The other assumes a reasoning bias. A recent overview [30] concludes that the latter has the best support of the two. But this answer begs the question: if there is a reasoning bias, where does that reasoning bias originate? Indeed, we are not satisfied with just knowing there is such a bias, rather we would like to describe how that bias unfolds as a cognitive process. To do so, let us formulate the participantsâ judgements as the outcome of a decision process. The explanations in the literature almost invariably involve two competing states, one in which Linda is a bankteller, and another where she is a feminist. To most participants in the experiment these states are not compatible, and whether bias or reasoning, each can in principle tip the scale in favor of one state or the other. In order to make headway, we have to take a closer look at the notion of compatible and incompatible states. In this presentation we will formulate states in the language of quantum cognition. Especially for the reader who is not already familiar with this approach, we will first recall some concepts from quantum mechanics. One such concept is the (formal) notion of compatible and incompatible states. Incompatibility lies at the heart of Heisenbergâs famous uncertainty principle. It holds that when we are certain about a quantum particleâs momentum, we are necessarily uncertain about its position, and vice versa. Position and momentum are therefore called incompatible states. On the other hand, again given the momentum of that particle, we can still measure its kinetic energy with certainty, momentum and kinetic energy thus being compatible states."

37,28,0.942,The Making of Islamic Heritage : Muslim Pasts and Heritage Presents,"I believe this perspective to be truer to the nature of the development of ideas and practices pertaining to Islam. Read in this way, the mosque approximates to the trove of narrative materials pertaining to the past that has amassed over the course of more than a millennium. The density and variety of evidence available at the site of the Friday mosque in Isfahan makes it a case exceptional for its richness. However, I would like to suggest that principles regarding Islamic pasts that I have highlighted using it as an example are applicable more generally to materials and sites large and small. The ultimate point here is that heritage is an evaluative concept and is based on assessments of worth. Not all things from the past constitute heritage in all circumstances, and the ones that do differ between times and places. When assessing evidence pertaining to Islam, I suggest that we should begin with the presumption that Islamic understandings of the past are variable, both synchronically and diachronically. Traces at our disposal indicate a tremendous variety of ways of being and acting as Muslim. The diversity of meanings on display here has been inherent in Islamic discourses for all the contexts for which we have evidence. In tandem with these facts, Islamic valuations of heritage are also fundamentally diverse and changeable. As we can see in the case of the inï¬uence of the prestige of Italian restorers and modern organizations such as UNESCO, Islamic understandings need not be seen as exclusive or hermetic. Rather, the notion of heritage itself requires historicization in all contexts, which reveals investments held by us as well as people who created earlier material forms. I believe this perspective attunes us to pay the utmost attention to the particularities of the evidence we encounter while simultaneously avoiding reiï¬cation and being mindful of shadows cast by interpretive paradigms old and new. Appreciating and creating heritage are closely related, if not synonymous, matters, something that is as true today as it was for Muslims of the past whose effects we scrutinize to create our narratives."

233,63,0.942,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"expressed enthusiasm for the option value idea (Maclaurin and Sterelny 2008, section 8.4) we now think that the answer lies elsewhere. The crucial problem with option value is that it ties the value of biodiversity to judgements about value made by ordinary people (consumers in the economistâs terms). Clearly actual assessments of such option value will be difï¬cult (Norton 1988). Even if we could assess such judgements, human beings are not good at reasoning about risk and they have limited biological knowledge. So it might be that peopleâs actual assessments about the option value in natural systems would be very poor guides to the likely effects of conservation on future human communities or on future ecosystems. If we hedge our bets to maximise future outcomes then we should do so based on our best information about the probability of such outcomes rather than on the estimates that consumers might make about such outcomes. In light of these issues, the value of biodiversity is better analysed as an instance of consequentialism, broadly applied. We should conserve biodiversity, not because people want to, but because doing so will on average lead to better outcomes for people and human communities of perhaps more broadly for moral patients (organisms capable of experiencing suffering).5 However, even the consequentialist interpretation faces an important objection developed at length in chapter 6 of Maier (2012). It might be objected that our uncertainty about future states of the biosphere and future goals and preferences of people implies that conservation based on a general measure of biodiversity is as likely to produce net harm as it is net beneï¬t (after all, the species we are conserving include many whose effects on human populations are currently unknown). There are of course instances in which diversity works against us, as when we are threatened by a diversity of pathogens. That said, ours is an extremely successful species with an extremely broad niche. We have become adept at harnessing a great variety of features of the natural world to an astounding variety of ends. The number of species that pose a serious threat to humanity is a vanishingly small proportion of the total species count. Moreover, a great number of weeds and pests are not harmful in their native habitat, but only become harmful when that habitat is radically disturbed or when they are introduced by humans into other ecosystems (Baker 1974). We therefore think it implausible that conserving unremarkable species will on average produce more harm than beneï¬t. Put another wayâwere possible, at the press of a button, to destroy all those species and biological communities not known to be of special value to humanity, we think it would be irrational to do so. Humanity (and perhaps other sufï¬ciently sentient species) would almost certainly be worse off. So where we cannot assess the likely payoff for conserving an individual unremarkable species, it is nonetheless rational to assume that that payoff will be positive. This does not of course tell us anything about how large such a payoff will be and we acknowledge that there is an interesting and difï¬cult question about weighing the beneï¬ts of such conservation against the opportunity cost of forgoing alter5"

Jungâs and Whiteâs letters about Barbara and her dreams give insights into her forceful personality and what inspired her in life, hence their inclusion here. In one dream Barbara described having a tug-of-war with Jung but she pulled him off balance with remarkable ease, reï¬ecting a determination to succeed even in the face of an opponent who was bigger, stronger and more famous than her. She described having bare feet, meaning having contact with the ground, the earth: âLoving the God who had walked on the earth, I became interested in the earth itself.â For Barbara, bare feet, like ballet, implied a relationship with the ground, and signiï¬ed freedom, pilgrimage and humility.39 She wrote to White in 1947: âI live for the Lord God who is Himself âat the serviceâ of mankind, and it is only in so far that I am âorientatedâ to Him that I myself am able to serve mankind. My life is dedicated to mankind because it has ï¬rst been dedicated to Him.â40 White wrote: âHer quite remarkable knowledge is balanced by a"

Fifth, we note the need for movement between nonverbal and verbal forms of interaction in creating knowledge and sharing meaning. When people limit themselves to just talking, they tend to become stuck. Choosing not to talk during a phase of experimentation with bodily forms of knowing and communicating is generative; and verbal communication is needed once more for shared reflection. The action experiments confirm how valuable it is for us as researchers to move out of our comfort zone when we are seeking new knowledge. We took two such steps in this project. First, we decided to participate in such an open exploratory process rather than stand back as observers or facilitators of a clearly structured workshop. Second, we chose in this chapter to focus our analysis solely on the visible evidence recorded on film. Both steps have proven highly generative. However, we recognize that the focus on the visible in our analysis did not give us access to certain important aspects. In order to explore the meaning the participants were giving to their actions, we need to listen to what they said and then connect that back to what we have observed. An analysis of the spoken words would enable us to correct or refine our configurations, for example. The other aspect we have not yet attended to are the power dynamics in the Studio for Social Creativity. Of course, they were present in the situation, for conflict in the region and tensions between groups at the college were two of the drivers for conducting the sessions in the studio. Moreover, there were differences in status among the participants (e.g., students vs. different levels of faculty; Palestinian Arab vs. Jewish backgrounds; men vs. women; and artists, academics, and practitioners). Exploring those dynamics in the construction of social space and use of physical space would require analyzing the spoken and written (e.g., graffiti) aspects along with the visible process. Another issue that needs to be examined is the potential paradox inherent in the Studio for Social Creativity. We have posited that the undifferentiated and unencrusted nature of the space is an important condition for enabling participants to generate new ideas and ways of engaging there. How will its potential as a space of possibility be maintained for groups to return to over time? The more they use the space, the more likely it is that they will build mental models of how to use it (even if they leave it unencrusted), making it harder on their return for them to break out of an unusual way of having used it. We sense a need to engage more frequently and intimately with the world of the arts to stimulate our learning. Actors and musicians have experience with the paradox because they have to keep being creative on the stages they return to night after night. Fortunately, some artists are seeking inspiration precisely by moving out of the spaces they know in order to engage in learning creatively with people from other worlds, including academics (Berthoin Antal, 2015). Acknowledgments We are grateful to the Institute for Advanced Study, Constance, for giving the first author the time and space to develop ideas for this chapter."

It was observed that 5 and 8 people had been vomiting after taking the medicine A and B, respectively. How would you use such data to estimate the probability of this adverse event? 7. The data may include knowledge elicited from a relevant domain expert, e.g., a clinician. Such process of obtaining the knowledge is called the expert knowledge elicitation. There are two principled types of decisions theories: 1. Non-statistical decision theory. It does not use data, i.e. it does not run experiments or collect data. It is purely based on probability theory and utility theory. 2. Statistical decision theory utilises data. It is based on statistics, probability theory, and utility theory. It is based on knowing the random variables and their expectations. It is also based on statistical Inference (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals), and it can also use Bayesian statistics. When making a decision, we as the decision maker may face the following: â¢ One-stage decision problem. E.g., we decide if we buy a share, and then we face the outcome, we decide to which school we put our child. â¢ Multi-stage decision problem. E.g. we decide if we pay for the advice of a financial advisor, and then after his advice, we decide if we buy the share or not, hence we are making our second decision. Here we can use Decision Trees (see Chapter 6)."
305,116,0.942,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"We do not know the probabilities that should be assigned to the configurations. There are eight possible configurations, so it might seem plausible that they each occur with probability 1/8, but they perhaps are not all equal. Our mathematical analysis will make no assumption about these probabilitiesâ values. We can, however, assign definite probabilities to the measurement directions. Both Bob and Alice are choosing each of their three bases with equal probability, so each of the nine possible pairs of bases occurs with probability 1/9. Notice that each row contains at least five As, telling us that given a pair of qubits with any configuration the probability of getting an A is at least 5/9. Since the probability of getting an A is at least 5/9 for each of the spin configurations, we can deduce that the probability overall must be at least 5/9, no matter what proportion of time we get any one configuration. We have now derived Bellâs result. The quantum theory model tells us that Aliceâs and Bobâs sequences will agree exactly half the time. The classical model tells us that Aliceâs and Bobâs sequences will agree at least 5/9ths of the time. It gives us a test to distinguish between the two theories. Bell published his inequality in 1964. Sadly, this was after the death of both Einstein and Bohr, so neither ever realized that there would be an experimental way of deciding their debate. Actually carrying out the experiment is tricky. John Clauser and Stuart Freedman first performed it in 1972. It showed that the quantum mechanical predictions were correct. The experimenters, however, had to make some assumptions that could not be checked, leaving some chance that the classical view could still be correct. The experiment has since been repeated"

In one of the most famous books in English literature, Wuthering Heights, a child of unknown parentage, Heathcliff, falls in love with Cathy, with whom he played during his childhood on the Yorkshire moors. One of the reasons he cannot marry Cathy, even though their passion is mutual, is that he is poor and of unknown parentage. One day Nelly Dean, the servant who narrates the bulk of the story, says to Heathcliff: Who knows, but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one weekâs income, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and the thought of what I was should give me courage and dignity. â¦ (BrontÃ« 1996: 41)"

147,259,0.942,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"In particular, most medical professionals have developed in-depth knowledge of health problems from treating numerous patients, which could facilitate opportunity identification (Simmons, 2002). For instance, using patent data from the American Medical Association, Chatterji, Fabrizio, Mitchell, and Schulman (2008) demonstrated that doctors filed nearly 20% of all medical-device patents in the USA from 1990 to 1996. However, many medical professionals may be reluctant to act upon the potential opportunities they identify for reasons related to decreased desirability and/or a lack of apparent feasibility. There are likely to be high opportunity costs for doctors who choose to exploit opportunities (i.e., entrepreneurial action is less desirable), or they may believe they lack the personal knowledge needed to fully exploit an opportunity (i.e., entrepreneurial action is seen as infeasible). This type of scenario opens up numerous paths for future research. Combining the identification of a health opportunity identified with its exploitation. When an opportunity to improve health is identified but not exploited, it represents a potentially wasted resource (and, worse, people may continue to suffer who otherwise would have benefited from the exploitation of the opportunity). Therefore, it is vital for researchers to question and empirically investigate our initial premise: do medical professionals detect health opportunities (third-person opportunities) that they do not end up personally acting upon? If so, why not? In the end, what happens to these potentially valuable opportunities that are recognized but not exploited? Perhaps the medical professionals who initially identify these ideas share them with their colleagues, who in turn ultimately agree that they do represent opportunities for someone but not for them due to their lack of knowledge and/or motivation to act upon them. However, some individuals do end up acting upon the opportunities they identify to improve health. Why do only some individuals do this and not others? Entrepreneurship programs could be a useful addition to medical professionalsâ education and training. Future research should investigate the characteristics and benefits (if any) of such entrepreneurship programs for medical professionals. While researchers often view the entrepreneurial process as involving only one actor (e.g., one individual, team, and/or venture), this assumption is an artificial limitation to our conceptualization of the practice of entrepreneurship, especially when othersâ health is the outcome of that practice. When a medical professional identifies an opportunity but does not believe it represents a personally desirable or feasible opportunity, can"

This critical moment in a concert hall is a miniature example of how human fallibility can affect the quality of what people are trying to achieve together. Excellence in this performance depends on the detection of error, and an initiative to halt the course of events it sets in motion. Musicologist and conductor Mette Kaaby sees it as a nightmare situation, one that should not happen but may nevertheless be a reality. âA performance of Mozartâs Requiem is all about collective precision. The choir and their conductor has put down hundreds of hours of practice together, to get the details exactly right. They are supposed to breathe, move, and sing together as one entity. The conductor needs to be sensitive to what happens among the choir members, and should be able to note signs among them that something is wrong. When that does not happen, it can create a musical crisis.â (Kaaby, 2016). The narrative about the conductor and the choir builds on an event that actually took place in a concert hall. What happened next was that one singer saved the day by discreetly correcting the tone from the conductor. The other singers started from that new tone instead, and the performance went well. There was a barrier system in place to stop the conductorâs initial mistake from developing into a collective breakdown in the form of bad singing. The narrative also highlights other dimensions of coping with fallibility at work, as will emerge in the concluding reflections below. This book has addressed how individuals, groups, and organizations can handle fallibility at work. It has highlighted how mistakes are not necessarily bad, since they can generate breakthroughs in innovative processes. Kaaby explains how there can be musical contexts where starting from a mishit tone can generate unexpected new dynamics among musicians. You open the wrong door, and explore what you find there, rather than turn around and insist on opening the door you were planning to open in the first place (Kaaby, 2016). Even in cases where mistakes lead to a bad outcome, there can be important learnings to"
275,295,0.942,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"for these reasons is a desire to maintain a strong relationship with us (whether that is economic, love, friendship etc.). Trust between individuals is different to trust we have in corporations. This asymmetry is a really significant issue for AS, because humans ground their trust in beliefs about the corporation behind the AS, not the systems themselves instantiated in a single car, robot, or computer installation. Social norming is an approach to procedural ethics outside of traditional philosophical theories from anthropology and sociology [101]. Social norming is about learning how to behave in groups to get along the best. It requires we understand social expectations. Detailed theories of cooperative behaviour stem from disciplines such as sociology, biology, anthropology and group psychology. These models are not about competence and achieving optimal performance on tasks, but about creating the most cohesive, resilient teams of organisms. Theories such as game theory contribute to understanding social norming [72]. One of the many advantages of group level norms is the ability to train AS with social norming without needing top-down ethical theories to drive behaviours. However, while there are promising avenues for research into the ethical programming to improve trust, many barriers exist for the universalization of such programming. This is because there remains vast disagreement on what the right ethical principles are or even whether ethical principles exist such that they could be implemented into an AS. What does ethical talk amount to? It seems that humans judge each others actions as ethical or not ethical based a huge range of theoretical, contextual, pragmatic and social factors that ethical theories struggle to explain beyond stipulating that actual human decision makers exhibit a sort of hopeless contrariness. There is a lot of work to be done in determining what the most ethical action is in any particular context and what model underpins such actions. However, even if we can program AS to be ultimately logical, rational or ethical, humans may be uncomfortable. Would we trust machines that obey norms without empathy [28]? Consider the origins of the word robot from the 1920 play, Rossumovi UniverzaÌlniÌ Roboti (Rossumâs Universal Robots). In the play Czech writer Karel Capek endowed robots with not just thoughts, but emotions to enable them to increase their productivity [97]. Capekâs robots were forced workers more like biological androids Replicants in Bladerunner than metal machines. If we program AS with emotions and empathy to build trust, will they suffer if we treat them badly? If AS are moral agents that can suffer, then building trustworthy autonomous systems also means building an ethical and legal framework around their use and identifying their rights [81]. Japanese roboticists are already designing robots to have âkokoroâ, translated into heart, spirit or mind [1]. Kokoro stems from animist spiritual thinking that all objects, including rocks and trees, have some level of consciousness and agency including emotions, intelligence and intention. Robots and AS of the future may need complex social identities to meet ethical and social norms."

There is a risk involved and the stock market situation is complex with several factors to consider (such as technological changes in the relevant industry). How to advise her? If there are relevant data that we can use and if the scenario is complex, we may be able to use some more complex model from statistical modelling. For example, we may use a Time Series model or Markov Chain. After fitting those models, we can then estimate the needed probabilities pi for the risk description (Equation 1.1). We discuss the key probability concepts in Chapter 3 and 4. This book is only focusing on Time Series and Markov Chains for three reasons. First, they are very commonly used methods for risk analysis. Second, we intended this book to be an intermediate-level book and we consider Time Series and Markov Chains suitable, while we assume no prior knowledge of them and we only show the intermediate-level modelling details. Third, it would not be possible to put all models in one book. So these two modelling approaches serve as examples of how to use statistical models for risk estimation, interpretation, and communication. Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence methods can also be used to estimate the risks. In fact, many researchers call the Time Series and Markov Chains examples of machine learning methods. There is extensive research on the development and application of statistical and machine learning methods for risk estimation. In our chapters, we will point at several key examples."

Has Brexit shown this to be the case? Is Union citizenship, after all, nothing but a concession made by the Masters of the Treatises that can be called back at political convenience? Is EU citizenship somehow âmeaninglessâ? A positive implication of adopting the functionalist theory is that answers to these questions are of no consequence for the analysis conducted. It does not matter for the functionalist theory whether the citizenship is ârealâ or a case of rhetoric. The theory is only committed to the fact that citizenship is a status, putative or not. The theory is agnostic towards âthickâ concepts associated with citizenship such as identity and recognition. This is due to the fact that it is not a theory suggesting a conception of citizenship. There are arguably many such conceptions, the pros and cons of which have been debated in great detail over the last decades by citizenship scholars (Mindus 2014). The functionalist theory offers a concept of citizenship, not a conception. The concept of citizenship that the theory develops only requires a very minimal ontological commitment: That status civitatis is, conceptually speaking, a middle-term. As such, it is not true, nor false. As such, it does not âcorrespondâ to any empirical fact. It can, nonetheless, be investigated from an empirical perspective. There does not need to be anything âout thereâ to which the concept corresponds for it to work. What is required of status civitatis is to connect grounds for acquisition and loss with legal positions. This characterisation does not only ï¬t the legal facts. It is fully able to explain the constitutional dimension of citizenship policy. No ontological commitments to peopleâs identity or ability to identify with others are needed for this purpose. The theory is in line with the tradition of Scandinavian legal realism, a corpus of philosophical literature concerning this very point that has too often been neglected by legal scholars to their detriment.1 In keeping with this tradition, there is no need to believe that the legal concepts used somehow exist to provide insightful analysis into how they work. As Alf Ross famously argued in relation to the concept of ownership, it might be the case that it is in reality a meaningless word, a form of rhetoric, without changing the fact that, by looking at how it connects the conditioning facts and the conditional consequences in the law, we can understand perfectly well how the concept works â et pour cause, scrutinise it critically.

It also answers to one of the most universal myths, which has both its left-wing and right-wing variants, the notion that once upon a time things were simpler and the people were at one with themselves. (Samuel, 1992: 18) Thatcherâs Victorian idyll was peopled with industrious, honest and morally upright citizens; hard-working artisans who rose slowly through diligence. The âVictorianâ values she extolled were those of thrift, charity, independence and hard work. In a much-quoted interview with Peter Allen she praised the upbringing she was given by a Victorian grandmother and used it to delineate Victorian values as she wished to exploit them: you were taught to work jolly hard, you were taught to improve yourself, you were taught self-reliance, you were taught to live within your income, you were taught that cleanliness is next to godliness, you were taught self-respect, you were taught always to give a hand to your neighbour, you were taught tremendous pride in your country, you were taught to be a good member of your community. (Thatcher, 1983b) Arguing that Thatcher was highly selective in her invocation of âVictorian valuesâ, Samuel contrasts the Victorian Britain of Thatcherâs rhetoric with that described in the oral histories and accounts given by those of her generation and earlier. Rather than focusing upon frugality, hard work and discipline, these accounts emphasise a sense of joy, of fun and of community: in working-class accounts of the âgood old daysâ, â¦ it is the images of sociability that prevail â the sing-songs in the pubs, the funeral processions, the âknees-upâ street parties, the summer outings. The canvas is crowded with characters; street performers will sometimes get a page or two to themselves and there may be a whole chapter for Whitsun or Bank Holiday. Shopping is remembered for its cheapness â¦ People are forever in and out of each otherâs housesâ¦ (Samuel, 1992: 18) In these accounts, too, the Victorian era is celebrated in contrast to the present, and painted as an idyllic, simpler time. Yet Thatcherâs Victorian idyll is very different to the Eden constructed by these oral histories. Her version, Samuel observes, is âaltogether more severe. Her lost Eden"

Not having to rush, and knowing that the childâs concentration span is limited, helps the interviewer stay calm and focused on the child, and able to observe the childâs behaviour, language and reactions to questions, various tasks and topics. During this session, the child should also receive information about the reasons for the interview, preferably in a way that is not an invitation to start talking about the actual case. Props like a picture book, a puzzle or drawing materials can be used in the first session, to help the child start talking. In DCM, drawing material is usually the only play material used. As in DCM, the child should be informed of the basic rules of communication for the interview, including that the child can say I donât know if there is something they simply do not know, and to correct the interviewer if they say something that may be incorrect. The props mentioned above can also be used to examine the childâs knowledge of concepts such as quantity, size, colours and shapes. By talking about neutral matters while using props, the interviewer and the Barnahus counsellor explore the childâs cognitive abilities. In the first session, questions should primarily be open, to see if the child understands open questions. The interviewer will also use more specific questions, such as what, who, where and how, to explore the childâs responses. In this session, it is also important to encourage the child to tell the truth. Young childrenâs understandings of abstract concepts like âtruthâ and âliesâ are complicated matters in a legal context. Here, however, the interviewer is only required to inform the child about the rules of telling the truth so that the interview meets legal requirements [Criminal Code Â§ 128 (StraffeprosesslovenÂ§ 128)] and fulfils the regulations of child investigative interviews Â§10 [Forskrift om avhÃ¸r av barn og andre sÃ¦rlig sÃ¥rbare fornÃ¦rmede og vitner (tilrettelagte avhÃ¸r)]. Normally, the interviewer introduces a recent event the child has experienced, and the child will then be asked to say more about itâ in order to explore the childâs ability to master the free narrative form. If not, information collected in the preparation phase will be used to explore the childâs abilities to narrate prior experiences."

There was no other solution like it nor would there have been one, because the conditions for its creation were unique to Kenya and other developing economies. Africa in space and time must take charge of its destiny, using digital technology to take advantage of the confluence of a young and growing demographic, an increasingly multipolar political world, and all the advantages of not being saddled with generally older populations and analogue technological systems. If you look around, this is already taking placeâand is increasingly crossing over to innovations that combine software and hardware.

In contrast to for-profit markets, where profit is made through product sales, nonprofit markets give grants to start-ups so that they target beneficiaries, that is, those at the bottom of the pyramid who cannot otherwise afford to pay for the companyâs product or service. As one technology entrepreneur explained: [For grants] you need to hit as many poor people in the slums as possible. That might be different from what angel [investors] say.

223,417,0.942,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"One can try to systematically adopt the emic view by drawing on ethnographic decision tree modeling (Gladwin, 1989). The textbook example for this theory is not one of foragers but rather of American college students and the question of whether or not they go to have lunch at McDonaldâs. The technique is that one tries through interviews to elicit as many criteria as possible that are said to be relevant for this decision to go or not to go (criteria such as whether one likes the food, likes the service, knows where a McDonaldâs is). Then the criteria are sorted according to a decision-making tree, which is subsequently tested against the decisions that the college students actually report when being asked where they have lunch. That is, the model should account for most of the decisions observable in real life. Failure to do so would indicate that a criterion is either missing from or misplaced in the decision-making tree. As a product of inductive reasoning, the tree makes predictions on the basis of probability and takes account of local values and decisionmaking criteria. If some of the decision-making treeâs underlying criteria and values are subject to change (e.g., with age), decision-making trees will likely differ from one cultural or subcultural group to the next. One can thereby test and substantiate a relativistic hypothesis through the inductive reasoning of probability. Again, this model of ethnographic decision trees works well in some instances. It apparently holds in particular for small-scale farmers and their choices of which crop to grow and when. Stated differently, it seems to work in settings of small homogeneous groups with decisions of seasonal regularity. It does not work as nicely with foragers, however, as I found when trying to employ this method with San (âBushmenâ) in Namibia. The individuals there are not homogenous in their responses, and it seems that the decision to move camp is not considered an instance that can be looked at through the lens of probability but rather only in personal terms as it were. The question that I asked in my field research was not about going to McDonaldâs (Namibia being one of the worldâs few countries without McDonaldâs). Instead, I asked what locals thought about attending secondary school, which for them means moving away from home, attending boarding school, or staying with distant family. There was no problem in eliciting an ethnographic decision tree. Everyone agreed that secondary education was important and that children should take this opportunity if they had found someone to pay their fees, buy them a school uniform, and offer them a place to stay. There was also agreement that discrimination by teachers or fellow students, food shortage at the place one was staying, or similar problems should not be permitted to make the children quit school. Despite this consensus, however, individuals constantly, and often for highly idiosyncratic reasons, deviated from the outcome predicted by the model. It emerged in this research that the social agents concerned refused to see major personal choices (such as moving away from home to attend school) as decisions to be taken from a perspective of nowhere in particular. The agent was not regarded as replaceable by anyone else. There was no notion of âall things being equal,â which would have allowed for a neutral weighing of alternatives. This personalization of decisions applied to the manner in which the agent is perceived, the fact that a decision is seen to be analogue rather than digital, and the degree to which individual"

Representations of cancer surgery thus consistently engaged with the potential of that operation both to help and harm. Where cancer surgeons might try to efface the dangerous and painful nature of their interventions, however, other medical practitioners had no such qualms. For every author who provided accounts of or instructions for cancer operations, there were many more writers â often physicians, but sometimes lay onlookers or surgeons writing against their perceived inferiors â who accused cancer surgeons of conduct which was at best careless and at worst positively evil. In a 1703 publication from âT.D.â on the âAbusesâ committed under the name of chirurgery, for example, the author singled out one surgeonâs cancer operations for particular attention.90 This operator was, it seems, moderately famous for mastectomy operations in particular: T.D. stated that âI make no question but you have hearâd of one who calls himself the un-born Drâ.91 The doctorâs practice, wrote T.D., was âmonstrousâ: âThe Number of Womens Breasts, which this man has cut off within these few Years is scarce to be believâd: And yet ... he cannot produce One, where there was a true ulcerated Cancer, that is now living to tell Tales of Himâ.92 Given that cancer was widely acknowledged to be difficult if not impossible to cure, âwhat then can we thinkâ, asked the author, of this shameful Undertaker, who makes no more of taking off a Breast (althoâ no otherwise than a Butcher might do the same) than some Persons do to pair [pare] their Nails, so that scarce any thing of a distemperâd Breast is presented, but the poor Woman is frightenâd out of her Wits, with the dismal Sentence pronouncâd of its being Cancerous.93 For T.D., the activities of the âunborn Dr.â could not be viewed as compassionate or progressive. Instead, the casting of the surgeon as âUndertakerâ in this account explicitly opposed the operatorâs self-construction as a preserver of life. Moreover, naming the doctor as a âButcherâ who cut up women as readily as he cut his nails subverted surgeonsâ emphasis on the"

I had never met the prime minister. I didnât know any other cabinet members either. I had attended the protests on Rustaveli Avenue the previous month, but I had not met any of the leaders. I really had no idea why the prime minister wanted to see me. How did his ofï¬ce even get my number? Was it related to my job? I was working in the energy sector at the time, and I had a reputation as a critic of the governmentâs energy policy. Perhaps they had come to me for an insiderâs perspective? Or had I done something wrong and was about to be reprimanded? But why would the prime minister deal with me personally? Either way I looked at it, this was big. I hurried to the State Chancellery.

Europe must not and cannot tolerate such invasions. This comment stirred up different reactions among our interviewees. On the one hand, they condemned what they called a âstereotypical positionâ which is âradically underinformedâ and, thus, âformed quite superï¬ciallyâ (P2, FG1). On the other, they acknowledged that such cultural prejudice is very hard to overcome, unless our educational models change in order to provide us with the right instruments to do so. Of course the media role was also emphasised as a primary bearer of such a change, given the way in which it continuously affects the opinion of people of all ages. More speciï¬cally, they suggested that our society needs a ânew common senseâ (P6, FG1), according to which, everybody should have the opportunity to live without borders. So, rather than giving this particular opinion any weight, our interviewees swiftly dismissed it as ignorant and an example of an unacceptable marked stereotype. What they counter-argued was that anyone who expresses an opinion like this should be reminded that these âpoor peopleâ are âjust trying to have a better lifeâ (P3, FG1). The second comment, which is another example of a xenophobic remark, this time against the particular ethnic group of Roma people, was a response to an article reporting the attempted robbery of a jewellery store by a Sinti woman. (122) Seppellitela in galera e buttate la chiave. Data lâetÃ  non dovrebbe avere ï¬gli piccolissimi che possano farle da scudo. Dimenticavo. Era una rom di etnia sinti?

Ah I almost forgot, was she a Sinti? Well, Sinti are the worst and most dangerous among Roma, as they can blend in among common people better than others. Anyway, theyâre all thieves and outlaws. This comment spurred the intervieweesâ feeling of disappointment even more. While acknowledging that the stereotyping of Roma people as thieves is quite widespread, both in Italy and beyond, they underlined the necessity of focusing on the act of stealing rather than on the speciï¬c ethnicity of the thief. They then highlighted the âcarelessness and inaccurate attitude of news reportsâ (P4, FG1); they underlined the responsibility that journalists and media reporters carry, as far as the conditioning of the general publicâs perception of current events goes,"

Having said that, students on clinical placements will also experience a sense of disempowerment at the lack of resources and human resource context and the impact this has on their ability to demonstrate care and compassion: Throughout my three years [at university] everything that theyâve taught us is all about the patient, caring for the patient and having empathy and sympathy and you know looking after their needs . . . once youâre out there you just see people dying of reasons that you could literally treat them with no problem over here.

When we leave out the beam splitter at the lower right corner we can detect the path of the particle, because only one of the two detectors will respond. However, when we do insert the beam splitter and have many particles, one at a time, pass through the interferometer we will ï¬nd all particles in one of the exit ports provided we adjust the arm length appropriately. This behavior is a consequence of the wave nature of matter. Indeed, due to destructive interference no particles are in the other port. So far we have only discussed another manifestation of the complementarity principle. However, we can now go one step further, and use our knowledge of the time at which the particle entered the interferometer. Moreover, if we know the initial velocity of the particle we can predict the time at which it will impinge on the second beam splitter. Within the period deï¬ned by the entrance of the particle into and its exit from the MachâZehnder interferometer we can now decide if we want to insert the second beam splitter or not. In this way we make a delayed choice between our ultimate observation of interference or âwhich-path.â We start from a situation where the second beam splitter is present when the particle enters the interferometer. In the language of the macroscopic world the particle has to display its interference nature and has to move on both paths. This interpretation runs into problems when in the last moment before the particle hits the second beam splitter, we take it out. Now, we are asking for path information and the particle had to go on one path only. However, by that time the particle has almost reached the beam splitter. It can therefore not go back and retrace its tracks. Our procrastination in making a decision, that is, the delayed choice of interference versus âwhich-pathâ highlights the idea that in the microscopic world the properties of particles are not well-deï¬ned until they are observed. We emphasize that many delayed-choice experiments with light and matter waves have been performed. They clearly show that the delay has no inï¬uence on the observation. We observe the features that we choose to observe. As J. A. Wheeler puts it:"

Apart from the type of use, it is important to look at how it is used (ad hoc vs. integrated) and why it is used (reporting, performance improvement or value creation). The overall purpose â or the why question â is related to the corporate sustainability strategy: is it aimed at compliance and reducing risk or is the goal to create shared value. The more it is aimed at value creation, the more LCA should be integrated in the business. Is it more directed at compliance and reporting, LCA probably stays more ad hoc. Reporting and improving performance can be done on a department level, innovation requires a more integrated and holistic approach. To develop these specific applications for LCA it is essential to link up with people from these departments to explore the needs and opportunities â remember the personas we presented earlier. In some companies they recognized this need and created a specific position to liaise between the LCA department and the internal client. In a transition phase this could be a good solution."

If we donât the new ideas we bring could be much worse for them than the old ideas we want to help change.â European nurses in Papua New Guinea during the colonial period thought of themselves as challengers of traditional culture, bravely facing down ânative law,â âfear of taboos,â and the supernatural forces that held such a prominent place in indigenous explanations of illness (Kettle 1979). In the decade leading up to Independence in 1975, Papua New Guineans of both sexes were recruited to replace the European sisters and matrons that had previously held the majority of government nursing positions alongside lower ranked male orderlies and medical assistants. The assumption was (and to a certain extent remains) that these educated nationals would serve as cultural brokers between the newly independent state and the rural majority, understanding, if not actually sharing, indigenous etiologies and healing practices. Over 40 years after Independence, nurses in PNG are indeed exceptionally attentive to âcustomary beliefs,â though perhaps not in the ways that national development planners had hoped. Rather, in the contemporary context, with quality health care largely inaccessible outside of urban areas, nurses are taught to see witchcraft, sorcery, and magic as weapons of the weak, with which rural clients can elicit recognition from neglectful others, including the absentee state and its representatives. Classroom lectures emphasized that students should always treat claims of supernatural illness as real and accountable matters: as teachers explained, âCustomary belief, it can affect us, so you must entertain it. Otherwise, they will start a big war in the village and they will take the hospital to court.â They taught students that the Nursing Councilâs professional code of ethics required acknowledging the reality of pasin tumbuna (ancestral practices). Whether the forces behind these beliefs were ontologically real or not, âIf you donât respect the beliefs, the talk will come back to get you, it will hold you.â BjÃ¸rn Bertelsen, in Chap. 2 of this volume, notes that contemporary witchcraft and âtraditionalâ cosmologies share a âprofoundly open natureâ¦ irreducible to stable sets of socio-cultural values, institutions and practicesâ (Bertelsen, this volume, 50).

48,36,0.942,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"In spite of the same time prediction instructions and the same prediction task, the meanings of the predictions differed greatly (see Table 3.2). In addition, a large proportion of the software developers, all of whom regularly produced and communicated time predictions, openly admitted that they did not really know what they meant by their time predictions. We have conducted several studies of this type in various contexts and they all show great variety in what is meant by a time prediction. This was the case even within a homogeneous context, such as within a single company. The studies also confirm that the meaning is usually not communicated by those producing the time prediction and that those receiving the predictions rarely requested such information. Requesting a time prediction without stating precisely what is wanted could lead to time predictions representing anything from best-case to risk-averse thinking. Much of what seem to be time prediction errors and unrealistic plans may simply be the consequences of poor communication of the meaning of the predictions. Sometimes people try to explain what their time prediction means by including verbal probabilities or qualifiers, such as âvery likely to take less than four hoursâ, âpossible to be completed in two daysâ, âwill take about three hoursâ, and âcan take 10 hoursâ. Such phrases are not only vague with a strongly context-dependent meaning [5], but also frequently misunderstood. The time prediction âit can be finished in five daysâ is, for example, likely to be understood differently by the person communicating it and the person receiving it. The person communicating it tends to think that five days is an extreme outcome, in this case, perhaps the best-case outcome. The person who receives the time prediction will, on the other hand, tend to interpret it as a likely outcome [6]. While using the word can ensures that you are never wrong (you never claimed that it was certain or even likely that the job would be finished in five days), it is certainly not a precise way of communicating time predictions. Similar interpretation challenges accompany the use of more than and less than. A task predicted to take more than 10 hours may, for example, be interpreted as larger than one predicted to take less than 20 hours [7]. The use of verbal probabilities and qualifiers, in spite of their frequent use in professional and daily life, turns out not to be very helpful when communicating time predictions. In some cases, we can make a good guess, perhaps based on the context and previous experience, of what is meant by a time prediction. If someone says, âIâll be there in 5 minutesâ, our previous experience with that person may tell us that this is a best-case time prediction. If nothing goes wrong, the person will be there in five to 15 minutes; otherwise, it may take much more time. In cases in which we have"
117,104,0.942,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"when one reflects on a possible action from the perspective of autonomy, one applies a test of practical reason, that is an ethical test, to this action, namely the test of universalisability. One is supposed to ask oneself whether what one plans to do could be done by everyone âwithout contradictionâ (Kant 1996, p. 75, BA 57). According to Kant, this is a test which one must necessarily accept, because as a practically deliberating person one is part of the realm of universal practical reason, and in this realm, the only ethical criterion that does not rest on contingent preferences is the test of universalisability. Moreover, this test is not imposed on reason and practical reasoners from somewhere else, but originates within reason itself. It is a law that reason and oneself as a reasoner impose upon concrete cases of reason-guided will-formation and decision-making. For example, refusing to help someone when help could be provided at no great cost to oneself cannot be universalised, according to Kant, since if this preference were a universal law, a situation could arise in which one would need help oneself and not receive it. Hence, Kant concludes that a world in which no one helps others might be thinkable without contradiction, but it cannot be desired without contradiction (Kant 1996, p. 75, BA 56). To take another example, the desire to take oneâs life when oneâs future appears to bring more harm than happiness is, following Kant, contradictory, since if everyone adopted this preference, humankind would extinguish itself and there would be no one left to formulate and pursue preferences at all. Therefore, he claims, this preference contradicts its own condition when universalised (Kant 1996, p. 73f, BA 53). Much has been said for and against these examples and for and against Kantâs approach to autonomy and ethics in general. In the context of the discussion here, namely with regard to the autonomy dilemma, Kantâs approach initially appears to be a promising way to bring ethical content to the principle of autonomy and to understand will-formation as a reason-guided process. After all, autonomy is thought to involve ethical reasoning. Will-formation and decision-making about oneâs own future and well-being can be regarded as ethical reason-guided phenomena, as especially the second example above shows. Upon closer scrutiny, however, Kantâs approach has serious limitations with regard to resolving the dilemma of ethical content. In order to resolve this dilemma, an account"

Teachers are quite alone when deciding on what would be the neutral information to âdisseminateââeven if they really want to âdisseminateâ rather than âpropagateâ. A teacherâs ideal could be that there was some âconcrete stanceââor helpful guidance to the teacherâwhich would be an academically sound one and not a political prescription. This, as elucidated by wilschut (2010) whom we quoted in the beginning of this chapter, is, however, difficult to achieve. So in case of inherently biased and politicised issues there is perhaps indeed no better solution than leaving them to the âlonelyâ teacher to decide (groping alone in the darkness, as one teacher put it), rather than risking that biased prescriptions would be produced as a result of some public negotiations (for example, see the volume by Nakou and Barca 2010)."
49,380,0.942,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"A simple movement, which is thinking, always creating reflection of being and by this way thinking constitutes things and the world. Constitutional activity of thinking is usually linked to speech, to âlogosâ, but the thinking is movement, not language itself. Thinking is something what enables speech. However, it may break away from the speech and perform reflection being that exists at the level of perception, or on the other side at the level of certainty of the truth about essences that speech is not able to capture. If we want to differ essences and their processes of constitution as follows movement of thought, it is necessary to distinguish a layer of thinking from the layer of beings. If we did not do so, it would be ontological conception in contradiction. That's because it does not allow it to accommodate the multiplicity as a totality and a differentiation of the thinking and what there is another form of existence and how it is possible. It should be borne in mind that even the initial exclusion of thinking can do nothing else but thinking itself. Thinking is not deducible from being, because it would first have to devote itself. Much easier is to accept of independence of thought, which is in addition to being and which carried out the difference in essences. How can we explain in detail the processes of differentiation of entities which is carried out by thinking. Thinking in discourse performs comparisons between current percepts and endocepts, ie, thinking is saying ""that's not it"" or ""that's it."" Basically, these processes are therefore negation and identity. For example, when we want to characterize what is white, then our thinking is saying white is what is not red, what is not blue, what is not black, what is not yellow and so on. And when we are looking on something white then our thinking is saying it is like white. Percepts are constitutes by this way. However, if we do not built own mental picture of the world's, it means endocepts that precedes perception (it is probably before puberty), or if it is a new sensation, the mind does not have its own basis for comparison, we create then the things on comparisons with other sensations. This process is based on negation, because we cannot determine the percept by otherwise. Let's say that in the prepubescent stage of ontogenetic development we determine all things on the level of sense. For example ""salinity"" as something what is ""not bitter"", ""non-acidic,"" ""not sweet""."

Taking the role of the narrator also provided the opportunity to show the material and let them comment on the photographs and the stories we had collected to complete the picture further. Recalling places, people, and memories provided a basis for asking about their perceptions of transnational spaces. The photographs helped the interviewees to remember stories and memories they had not told us before. For instance, the beach of Galicia (shown in Fig. 13.4) reminded the interviewee of the fact that he used to go there with his uncle and his cousin to search for crabs. Later, the aunt would cook them for dinner. As this story shows, the pictures and the accounts of the field trip in Spain helped to recall this imagined space that in migration research is called the transnational social space. Asking the interviewees how they perceived this space spared using the word or explaining the notion. Therefore, we drew a first sketch of Switzerland and Spain while talking about people here and there, about places visited, and about connections heard about. The drawing showed in a very simple way what we usually imagine when we talk about transnational social spaces: countries and places within, all connected through social networks. By drawing, we invited them to take a pen and draw their impression of how these connections and social formations could be conceptualized. The drawing (Fig. 13.5) shows the formation created by the transnational networks that link a family on various continents. In contrast to the geographical mapping we had sketched, the person who made this drawing completely changed the order of things. He placed the family in the core circle. Through their linkages, their practices such as calling, communicating through Skype, sending emails, visiting each other, or sending goods across the whole world to each other, they constituted an entity that holds together what is otherwise spatially disrupted. Because of modern communication and transportation technologiesâthey are symbolized by the time warp signs that connect instantly continents and countries as in a science fiction filmâthe distances become irrelevant.

(Uehara 1995: 499) Justification theory does not, however, confine various orders of worth to specific cultures, but sees them rather as universal points of reference whose weight may nevertheless differ depending both on cultural context and situation. In Russian society, for example, reciprocal expectations exist in a context where â due to the Soviet heritage and probably the much longer domestic tradition of the Russian village community â people are bound to each other within a system of mutual dependency and thus accustomed to turning to each other for help in various daily life problems. Though this âdomesticâ idea of helping others out is now being challenged by the introduction of market-based principles in post-Soviet Russia, it has not disappeared. More importantly, it can be referred to even in the context of an interview concerning business-related favors, as the following quote from a Russian owner of a successful IT company shows: T: How and why does this [system of mutual favors] work? P1: Because mother was reading us fairy tales in childhood. In the fairy tale Mashenâka is running on a field, where there stands an oven. âTake the pie out, it is burning,â the oven says. Mashenâka takes the pie out of the oven. Then an apple tree asks: âShake me.â Mashenâka shakes the tree. But the bad girl just runs ahead and does not help anyone. And she will end up badly. This is what we were taught in childhood, to share things with everyone, to cooperate, to help. (general director, p1) The respondent is referring to a Russian fairy tale where the good girl Mashenâka is helpful and gets rewarded at the end while things end up badly for the girl who does not help out other creatures. Many of Ledenevaâs (1998) respondents recognized the same âobligation to helpâ.

You can overcome this risk by backing up the crowdsourcing process with a jury of experts who monitor the process and can intervene and provide a final evaluation, where required. There is always the risk of a participant losing his or her idea without getting paid for it. This might even happen without the initiatorâs appearance: it is possible that other participants or external viewers steal the idea. In this context we have to mention that it is frequently only the winner who gets rewarded for his or her inputâall the other participants miss out although they might have contributed several days of dedicated effort for the purpose of the challenge. For contestants, crowdsourcing and open innovation are a very debatable source of income. The safeguarding of a contestantâs property is left to his or her own resources. Researchers should therefore check the agreement drawn up between them and the platform host to see whether intellectual property is covered properly. This can be ensured by documenting timestamps and with the help of a good community management through the platform host. Of interest to both parties is the delicate question of profit participation: what happens if the participant receives 1,000 Euros for his or her idea but the company makes millions out of this idea? The question remains why a researcher or other collaborator should join in without any certainty that his or her contribution at any stage of the research/creation process is of value, whether it will be appreciated and adequately remunerated. So, the initiator and participant have to take a careful look at legal protection. Actually, this can prove to be quite easy: The initiator can set up the rules and the participant can decide, after having studied the rules, whether he or she agrees and wants to participate or not. A situation under constraint, such as financial dependence, is often rejected a priori. Assigning intermediaries can often serve to adjust a mismatch. The more specialized the task, the more weight rests with the expert or ââsolverââ. Internet communication enables the solver to draw attention to unfair conditions: Both platform host and initiator are interested in retaining a good reputation; any possible future participants might be discouraged. Much depends on the question of how the Internet can be used to connect B2C or B2B companies, scientists or research institutions to target groups and how to receive desired opinions and ideas; but also how to integrate scientists in particular? How to ensure and achieve valid results? What legal, communicative, social factors need to be contemplated? And what further steps are there to mind after a crowdsourcing process? It would be unflattering if customers, scientists and creatives were motivated to participate but, after that, nothing happened or they werenât mentioned in reports on the crowdsourcing process. That would only cause or aggravate frustration and that is something nobody needs."

My reference to peopleâs âwillingnessâ to undertake research is perhaps superfluous, given that I interpret capacity as including this, but I include it explicitly to factor in the importance of motivation and attitudinal preparedness. Researcher development constitutes a speciï¬c form of professional developmentâ it involves peopleâs development of the research-related elements of their professionalism and professional lives. It is therefore a sub-category of professional development, so to understand it we need to understand professional development, or human development, more broadly. The complex ecologies of peopleâs lives are becoming increasingly recognised as the fusion of work and personal life; development that occurs in a professional or work context, and that enhances oneâs capacity to undertake oneâs work, must inevitably impinge upon or influence the attitudes, viewpoints, knowledge, understanding, and skills that may be applied to oneâs life as a whole, and vice versa: a point that is implicitly incorporated into Erautâs (2004) thesis on workplace learning. My conceptualisation of researcher developmentâmy understanding of what it isâincorporates this more holistic interpretation of development. Yet, ironically, in order to reveal its component parts, I illustrate this holism through deconstruction."

Suffering takes many forms, and the question âWhy do I suffer?â is a basic, existential question that has been posed time and again, ever since Job did it in the âBook of Jobâ in the Old Testament. The story of Job is a story of suffering. The innocent Job is hit by one catastrophe after another because God and the Devil have made a bet as to whether Job will stick to his belief in God regardless of massive misfortune. Jobâs friends are not exactly great friends; they insist that Job must have sinned in order to be hit by such suffering. As they see it, all suffering is Godâs punishment for sinning, and since God is justice incarnate, the punishment must be just: ââ¦those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap itâ (Job: 4,8). They therefore believe that Job must necessarily be guilty but might have forgotten it himself, because you reap what you Until modern times, this was religionâs standard response: Have you been hit by the plague? Surely, you must have sinned. An earthquake? Godâs punishment! That will teach you. This is theological theodicy tradition, which defends God as good and almighty in spite of the existence of suffering. The term itself, theodicy, is a compound of teo = God and dikÃ© = justice. It was introduced by the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646â1716), who added the philosophical remark that suffering is a necessary evil in the best of all possible worlds11 to the traditional religious explanation of suffering as punishment. Supposedly, the reason man cannot see this is due to our limited perspective; but God sees it, and the Lord works in mysterious ways. There are examples of more modern responses in classic literature. The French philosopher Voltaireâs book Candide is a satirical debunking of the perception of suffering as deserved or a necessary evil (Voltaire 1991).

In Her the technology is seamless, no hiccups; the devices have beautiful interfaces like books and the larger screens have picture frames around them like art; culture is now technological and online. The computer game that Theodore is playing is a hologram in the middle of the room; he is totally immersed in online communication, and at night he can access cybersex chatrooms just by speaking into the air. Like Disconnect, a major theme in Her is loneliness in a society saturated with opportunities for communication. The ï¬lm is set in a futuristic landscape, and we often see Theodore in his semi-dark apartment with beautiful views over the metropolitan cityscape, very alone. When he travels on the subway, everyone around him wear earplugs, chatting incessantly with their devices, not looking at each other. Although surrounded by marvellous technology, he is not happy, and only comes alive when he falls in love with his operating system. Theodore loves the fact that Samantha is new, fresh and enthusiastic about life, does not have history and baggage, is constantly available and supportive, and has no physical presence. Ironically, the relationship between Theodore and Samantha is the only major relationship in any of the ï¬ve ï¬lms that evolves lovingly and harmoniously, a satirical version of a classic romantic comedy. Theodore and Samantha go on trips, comfort each other, play music together, go on a double date and introduce each other as âgirlfriendâ and âboyfriendâ to friends and family. In these scenes, Theodore is physically alone â with an electronic device in his pocket â but he communicates and behaves as if he has company. In the futuristic world of Her, society has evolved to a point where man-machine relationships are nothing to be shy about, indeed, they are depicted as more rewarding than real-life contact. Almost everybody reacts positively to Theodoreâs romance with Samantha; the only negative reaction comes from Catherine, his estranged wife, who accused him of being âmadly in love with his laptop.â Catherine represents the voice of technological resistance; defending human relationships even if they are complicated and difï¬cult.

If repentance is sincere God may show how some sins lead to positive impact of maturing spiritually. But what if a Muslim continues to sin without repentance until he dies? Muslim scholars differ among themselves, depending on the school of thought they represent. For example, the Kharjites maintain that a sinner will go to Hell and will never get into Paradise, even if the sin is not a major sin The SunniMuâtazilis maintain that if a person has committed a major sin, then his abode will be Hellï¬re for ever. On the other hand, other Sunni thinkers maintain that if the sinner is a believer of Islam and God, then his condition will be judged by God.

In prior work [5], we and others showed that an idealized model of the monitor correctly implements a higher-level abstract machine with built-in memory safetyâa bit more formally, every behavior of the monitor is also a behavior of the abstract machine. Building upon this work, we prove that this abstract machine satisfies a noninterference property similar to Corollary 1. We were also able to prove that a similar result holds for a lower-level machine that runs a so-called âsymbolicâ representation of the monitorâalthough we had to slightly weaken the result to account for memory exhaustion (cf. Sect. 4.5), since the machine that runs the monitor has finite memory, while the abstract machine has infinite memory. If we had a verified machine-code implementation of this monitor, it would be possible to prove a similar result for it as well."

You even saw how those 8-bit adders could be cascaded to add even larger numbers, and you may have wondered, Is this really how computers add numbers? Well, yes and no. One big difference is that computers today are no longer made from relays. But they were at one time. In November 1937, a researcher at Bell Labs named George Stibitz (1904â1995) took home a couple of relays used in telephone switching circuits. On his kitchen table, he combined these relays with batteries, two lightbulbs, and two switches he made from strips of metal cut from tin cans. It was a 1-bit adder, just as you saw in the previous chapter. Stibitz later called it the âModel Kâ because he constructed it on his kitchen table. The Model K adder was what would later be called a âproof of conceptâ that demonstrated that relays could perform arithmetic. Bell Labs authorized a project to continue this work, and by 1940, the Complex Number Computer was in operation. It consisted of somewhat over 400 relays and was dedicated to multiplying complex numbers, which are numbers consisting of both a real and an imaginary part. (Imaginary numbers are square roots of negative numbers and are useful in scientific and engineering applications.) Multiplying two complex numbers requires four separate multiplications and two additions. The Complex Number Computer could handle complex numbers with real and imaginary parts of up to eight decimal digits. It took about a minute to perform this multiplication. This was not the first relay-based computer. Chronologically, the first one was constructed by Conrad Zuse (1910â1995), who as an engineering student in 1935 began building a machine in his parentsâ apartment in Berlin.

They would be so happy to get fresh food straight from the sea on their plates. The air at the nursing home would be filled with the pleasant smell of grilled fish. Then one of us remembered what the law says about food at the nursing home. Everything we serve as food to the residents has to come from a registered supplier, and the fisher was not on the list. This meant that it would be illegal to grill and serve the fresh fish from the sea at the home. Still we felt that it would be the right thing to do, as it would be such a rich and thrilling experience for the residentsâ (Norlin & Borvik, 2016).

In a waterfall environment, there is an explicit stage called the design phase. This phase is led by the architect. He designs and documents the soluâ tions. The design is prescriptive. The assumption is that if the developers follow the design, then the software will be OK. This design phase is the most demanding and solemn of the entire software phase. If you get the design phase wrong, you will end up paying a high price for years to come. On the other hand, in an agile environment, there often is no design phase. In conseâ quence, the reasoning often goes: âIf in an agile environment, there is no design phase, so there is no designer hence no architect.â So we must clarify. No design phase does not mean âno designâ. No design phase means that there is not an explicit phase during which design happens exclusively. Rather, design happens all the time. Likewise, when we say that the architecture is emergent, that should not mean that we do not need architects because architecture just happens. That is not true. It means something much more subtle. When we say that the architecture is emergent, we are saying that as the system evolves, a certain structure emerges. Someone needs to keep an eye on that emerging structure. When it is emerging according to plan, the architect will strengthen it, and when it is starts diverging, the architect will act accordingly. Maybe adjusting"

In his spare time, he engages in high culture, as an erotic art connoisseur for instance, being the owner of seven original erotic drawings by Egon Schiele. We learn that Cantor inherited a fortune from his father-in-law â a wealthy Jewish industrialist from Vienna, whose only daughter Cantor had married when she was thirty-six â and this heritage included a complete art nouveau interior, a fin-de-siÃ¨cle Viennese decor, transplanted to Chicago, whose most remarkable item is a seating machine (Sitzmaschine). But this sample from Viennese existence is now embedded in the American way of life and combined with a splendid view over Lake Michigan. In the course of the novel it becomes clear that Cantorâs actions are much more calculated, strategic and self-centred than is initially apparent. The race for priority (and indirectly for the Nobel Prize) is much more important to him than something like scientific âtruthâ. And Cantor is quite good at playing the publication game. At a certain point he deplores the abolishment of the pli cachetÃ©, the âsealed envelopeâ system (p. 62), a reference which requires some explanatory remarks concerning the history of the scientific journal which, originally, was not invented as a communication device, but as a device for solving priority conflicts (Zwart 2001). By establishing formal outlets in the form of journals, discoveries could now be attributed to the scholar who first published about it, or whose paper first reached the editor of an acknowledged journal. And the âsealed envelopeâ procedure meant that an article could be submitted so that a journal editor, who would date it upon receipt, but would refrain from opening it until the author was sufficiently certain that its content could be validated and replicated, or when a competitor was about to publish something similar. In that case, the original submission data of the pli cachetÃ© would demonstrate priority. If still in place, it would significantly reduce the risk of retraction, and it would certainly have solved Cantorâs dilemma. But it would also turn publishing into a kind of card game, with the sealed envelope functioning as a kind of trump card. âI wonder what made me think of the pli cachetÃ© systemâ, Cantor asks himself, âI hope itâs not some unconscious wish of mineâ (p. 63).

We should âbe much more direct about what it is that [we] mean to sayâ. Neuroscientists and experimentalists would, in fact, warm to âa list of facts or statements separated by periods with the occasional transition term to hold it all togetherâ; at the moment, it was hard to â[extract] the message out of what seemed like an artistically-written piece that made use of many unconventional phrases and secondary definitions of otherwise common wordsâ. The second reviewer came from quite a different angle â arguing that there was âsomething peculiarly paradoxical in [the paperâs] very conceptâ. We, the authors, were trying to set ourselves up as âexperimentally, experientially, and intellectually outside of the âblack boxâ â, but in actual fact, we were held captive by âthe tools of cognitive neuroscience, i.e., on a scientific apparatusâ. No matter the âdepth and authenticity of the joint collaborative exerciseâ for which we were advocating, we were pinioned by the inescapability and irreducibility of the scientific laboratory. For this reviewer, the point of âthis âfourth wayâ of neuro-engagementâ was far from clear. For the scientist, the rhetorical style in which the âartistically-writtenâ paper was written obviated the chance that its arguments would be received by those coming from different, scientific, traditions of research writing. For the second reviewer, whom we assume to be a social scientist or humanities scholar, it conceded far too much to the sciences. This is a fairly consistent refrain. And yet, in general the two of us, as well as many of our collaborators, have been quite successful at publishing significantly interdisciplinary papers in relatively high impact journals â a success that we attribute at least in part to such papers having a certain currency among editorial board members at some journals. We do not want to prejudge whether this enthusiasm is necessarily shared by the editorial board members of many mainstream neuroscience journals. And for the collaborating neuroscientist, being published in a high impact social science journal, which may have both a relatively long time from submission to date of publication, and a relatively low âimpact factorâ compared to even mid-ranking journals in some biological and medical fields, might represent poor return for her labour.

13,400,0.941,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"(2009: 47) argues, masculinity is here constructed outside of shared recognition and bears the stain of the unmarked position. However, the men also want to defend their mothers as âotherâ and take care of her as strong men should. According to Benjamin (1995: 102), such attitudes of paternal protectiveness may also indicate latent maternal identifications. The weak mother in need of male protection is in particular seen in the accounts of the men who grew up in working-class and rural families. The mother is acknowledged more as a separate person in the interview with the one middle-class male informant we have in this generation. In the middle generation the mother is more visible. She is described as someone who had deserved to get more out of life, but she is seen as a kind, capable and caring person. She is not described with the joy and pride that is seen in the older and younger generation when sons talk about their fathers, but rather as âthe mother blanketâ (Holter and Aarseth 1993: 93). However, there is much less disidentification with feminine weakness in this generation of sons: the mother is not only a kind and warm person, she also does important things in the eyes of her sons in terms of her emotional competence and availability. The mother is primarily a love object, but in a limited sense is also a âlike subjectâ (Benjamin 1995). We may in this respect see traces of what Ken Corbett identifies as an internalised motherâson dialogue, which âoffers solace in the face of normative cruelty, and holds out the hope these boys need to imagine themselves otherwiseâ (2009: 114). Yet, the sonsâ sense of being different from her may have protected them from feeling overwhelmed by her services, as is more often the situation for the daughters. The sons of this generation identify as men, but since it is not clear what this implies or whether it is seen as something to strive for, this aspect of their gendered selves becomes less positive. The absent fathers also seem to give the masculine identities of their sons a defensive character: how do you defend yourself as a man if you do not know what it means to be one? For this reason it may be more vital for the men in the middle generation than for the men in the youngest generation to keep a watchful eye on the holding up of gender difference, something that complicates their efforts to incorporate and integrate the feminine qualities they value. The impression we get from some of the ânewâ men in this generation is that they use their"

This is especially useful when patients confound expectations (as in Watsonâs 1970 study), or requires significant intellectual work to make it fit (as in Waldenberg, 1972). However, this is principally a study of specific hospital practices, a certain set of psychiatric ideas about the social setting, and how these might resonate with a wider political context: a shift from a welfare-based, socially interventionist consensus to one of individuated, market-oriented competition. Roy Porter champions ideas of the âpatientâs voiceâ as central to the history of medicine, but this is not my principal area of interest.9 I am far more concerned with how ideas and research practices interact and produce the concepts and shorthand that humans use to understand themselves and others. Basing this book on the experience of the patient would make it a very different project. In addition, Joan Scott writes persuasively: When experience is taken as the origin of knowledge, the vision of the individual subject (the person who had the experience or the historian who recounts it) becomes the bedrock of evidence on which explanation is built. Questions about the constructed nature of experience, about how subjects are constituted as different in the first place, about how oneâs vision is structured â about language (or discourse) and history â are left aside.10 I am most interested in how âvision is structuredâ, in how ideas and practices come to influence what is possible and explicable behaviour, and how these change. This is not to demean patients or their stories, experiences or identities, but to say that this history attempts something different. The patients and their experiences recede in this telling, as do the psychiatrists to an extent. What is left are practices, arrangements, ideas, concepts â all the things that recur in psychiatric journal articles and government documents. This, like all history, must resemble its sources, but remains useful â hopefully to people other than myself â because it enables new connections to be made around self-harm, society, psychology and politics. It might make the various individuals involved in the story less visible (in terms of their experiences), or flatten them out to their research contributions, but it also allows new links: between categories of identity and the rise of professional groups; between broad political contexts and clinical categories; between an intellectual climate in psychology and psychiatry and the ways in which we understand selfdamaging behaviour; between politics and the ways in which people understand themselves and their identities."

As has been noted at several points in this book, many residents have lived in their hostels for 30 years or more. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising to find that â[t]o leave a residence, in which they have spent the better part of their life, is a difficult actâ (Unafo 2002: 45). Indeed, transferring oneâs residence to a care home can be validly described as a ânew immigrationâ (Sonacotra 2005a). Put simply, to leave the hostel is to leave home, even if it is not everyoneâs ideal of home. Care homes tend to operate according to a model of individualised, personalised residential care. For some of my respondents this approach was tantamount to separating and banishing older people from the wider community, which was anathema to their views on appropriate care for older people. For example, some of my respondents in DembancanÃ© expressed outrage at what they called the âWesternâ model of elder care: older returnees in the village were relieved that they had managed to avoid ending up in a care home in France. What is specific to the hostel population vis-Ã -vis other care home clienteles is the transition âfrom a lifestyle where the collective served as the means to withstand the difficult life conditions which they were made to experience, to a lifestyle where everything is very individualised, inside the EHPA or EHPADâ (senior civil servant). According to this same interviewee: it would be necessary that the EHPAs or EHPADs take into account the specific history of these persons. What has enabled them to survive is life in a group, so itâs very likely for someone who is liable to spend a significant period of time in an EHPA for example, that itâs not just one person on their own, it has to be three or four people who understand each other, who know each other a little."

There is always a degree of manipulation in such communication, as we try to influence human purchasing decisions through persuasion. Persuasion is therefore more than the simple act of providing information; it is a professional and measureable expertise in influencing decision-making. In commerce, there is a competitive environment in which a company tries to excel. When, however, we deal with the introduction and deployment of peer 4 regional development, we are not selling anything. We are inviting the population to take active part in the development of local core human and natural values that affect us all. This participation can be measured in the amount of response achieved, changes observed and improvements measured within the pursuit of the core values desired. In AiREAS, we measure air quality, health and regional dynamics. This gives us a great responsibility when dealing with persuasion. We donât lie or twist the truth to get a sale; we positively invite for innovative change with validated information and interpretation of data. And we measure and celebrate our results in terms of health and air quality development, not our bottom line ï¬nancial gain."

Models can help us understand what to measure. By looking at where a model is most sensitiveâthat is, where small changes in the model itself or the initial conditions result in big changes in resultsâwe can ï¬nd the places and conditions where we need observations to be able to evaluate (and constrain) a model. In weather forecasting, for example, there are certain situations where we know that small uncertainties can lead to big errors. A classic example is for tropical cyclones: Small differences in the temperature and pressure ï¬eld around a storm govern how it will intensify or weaken, and in what direction it will move. To improve forecasts, aircraft fly around the storms and take additional observations. These aircraft are guided by forecast models that identify where additional information can make the most difference to the accuracy of a forecast. In a climate context, we often do similar things on a larger scale: What climate phenomena do we not understand? And what observations would better constrain"
125,143,0.941,"Charismatic Christianity in Finland, Norway, and Sweden : Case Studies in Historical and Contemporary Developments","I asked him to elaborate. Responding, he immediately connected the question to Living Wordâs leadership structure: âWith regards to the pastor being fired by the church without the involvement of an elder councilâno such thing existed at the time.â The question, then, was who had the authority to ask the pastor to leave. He stated that the authority to depose a leader ârests with the church.â Along with the transformation of leadership structures came new understandings and practices, particularly involving gifts and manifestations. For example, prophecy is still an important gift of grace. Respondents varied in their perceptions of these changes. While Paulaâs view was largely positive, she was not altogether dismissive of the old ways: âIn the beginning, a lot of people experienced that the pastor or other leaders received prophecies that changed peopleâs lives,â she stated, expressing a sense of nostalgia for the way prophecy had been practiced at Living Word. âThere was a lot of prophecy, which I experienced,â she said reminiscing, âwhere the pastor walks around and receives messages from God. There was a lot that was not from God, but also a lot that was from God.â There is a sense of ambivalence to Paulaâs words: she distinguishes between true and false prophecies, emphasizing the helpfulness of the former, while also expressing reservations. When prophecy at Living Word turned into a means for public rejection of and creating a social stigma for dissenters, what followed can be viewed through the lens of Weberâs description of how a leaderâs charisma is likely to disappear if âhe is for long unsuccessful.â We have learned that prophecy was important to constructing and maintaining charismatic authority at Living Word. However, the particular way in which prophecy was applied seems to have changed over time, as it went from providing reassurance to carrying exclusion and social stigma. It seems that the shift in how prophecy was enacted robbed it of its capacity for generating charisma for the senior pastor; what had previously been a source of trust was tainted through its employment to discourage dissent. From a Weberian perspective, such a reaction to delinquency is to be expected from a charismatic leader (Weber 1947, 359). It is more noteworthy that a gift of"
163,191,0.941,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"Balance ouTsTanding Participating in svart arbete involves keeping imagined accounts with the state and other people in the community. Buying or providing services svart stabilizes a perceived deficit back in favour of the taxpayer. Exchanges of svart arbete can be made in terms of reciprocal relations when the state is perceived not to have supplied its fair shareâwhat it should have provided as a collector of its citizensâ money. Throughout is the underlying notion of reciprocity as maintaining a balance of sorts; purchasing svart, valuing a service and agreeing on compensation. Viewing svart arbete through the spheres of community and state also highlights the tensions between the private and the public, the strong community and what services a responsible state ought to provide for its citizens, which type of exchanges ought to be subject for tax assessment and which should be left out. As purchaser and provider in an exchange can view the transaction differently (Slater 2002: 240), so can their views on the balance of relations differ. This book calls us to take reciprocity seriously, and using ethnographic examples from Sweden I argue that the same type of expectations that exist between exchangers resides within the relationship that citizens as taxpayers have towards the state. Although exchanges between inhabitants and state are vast even from a daily perspective, impossible to quantify or account for, and immensely complicated in a welfare state, there is an abiding sense of a reciprocal relationship. From a residentâs perspective, reciprocal expectations indeed have an impact on the assumptions of what society should provide. I am thus using reciprocity to look at how balancing is aimed forâa perceived equitable standingâin citizensâ everyday exchanges and in how the state can find legitimate ways to tax them. Buying svart can thus be seen as a response to a feeling of having contributed too much to the state. The tax level is used by many as a justification; it is said to be too high or too all-encompassing. There were many justifications such as âI pay more than other Swedes doâ, with the implication that the âothersâ are seen to provide less than they should. From this perspective, buying svart is a means of evening out other citizensâ negligence in contributing fairly to the state. âAnd if they cheat, I am stupid if I do not do the same.â This balancing is a model for how giving and taking, in relation to the state and towards othersâ contributions, ought to work. There are a number of ways in which a balance in dealings with the state can be maintained; contributions are looking at the taxpaying sideâ"

Public outrage can never have positive effect for society to exert its resilience thoroughly, if it is just neglected or poorly cared.

Referral arrangements involving mental welfare officers and psychiatric out-patient clinics exist alongside new memoranda, renewed efforts at referral to psychiatric consultants and mental hospitals that, despite their differences, are all attempting to move towards integration. However, not everything goes so smoothly â Cardiff RHB even interprets the guidance in such a way as to decrease the visibility of communicative attempted suicide.70 Stengel has other problems with it and implies that the return is less than useless. His letter to the Ministry of Health is unfortunately no longer in the file, but there remains a copy of one he sends to the Superintendent of the Royal Infirmary, Sheffield. In it he argues that âI have not been able to comply with your request ... patients who have made suicidal attempts are not usually diagnosed as âattempted suicideâ but under some other heading ... The only way to provide the required information would be for the Ministry to request hospitals to put âattempted suicideâ into the diagnostic indexâ.71 He says that âit would be a pity if the Ministry should accept information which cannot possibly be valid [and] dangerously misleadingâ.72 This is a significant problem for the emergence of a consistent, epidemiological object of attempted suicide. As Stengelâs criticism highlights, without either a customised structure for its record, or the labour-intensive scrutiny of research psychiatry, attempted suicide is exceptionally difficult to pin down. Specialised research projects begin to record it during the early 1960s. W.

75,181,0.941,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","various realms of modern societies. Therefore, one could argue that Facebook has not just reached the critical mass to survive, but a hyper-critical mass, overpowering its competitors. While the concentration of users in principle serves the functionality of a SNS and thereby also its users, the power which is accumulated in this way has to be critically observed. On a general level, this has been already a subject of intensive public as well as academic debates which we cannot discuss here in detail. The main concern seems to be privacy-related: Facebook gathers vast amount of data about personal lives and gives its users only very opaque options to control what can be seen by others, including external companies which may have access to this data. This is also a major obstacle for the academic usage of Facebook. On the one hand, the technical hurdle for the academic usage of Facebook is very low for users who already apply the platform for their private lives on a daily basis. On the other hand, this may be exactly what holds them back if they do not wish to blend their professional and their private lives in this way. At the same time, some researchers are reluctant to disseminate work in progress as they feel it is imperfect or because they fear competitiveness (Harley et al. 2010, p. 13). Although this is a general issue of academic social media usage, it is particularly pressing when a companyâs business model depends on the exploitation of user data as in the case of Facebook or Google. Moreover, once a SNS has reached a hyper-critical mass, it creates new dependencies, as it works like a black hole: The bigger it gets, the more people are drawn to it, the more content is produced, and so on. Therefore, it becomes increasingly difficult to separate from it. A lot of time has been invested in learning to operate the platform, building networks, discussing issues, editing profiles, creating publication lists, tagging items, etc. Most of this data and effort cannot easily be extracted and imported into another platform, so the hurdle to leave it becomes higher and higher, especially if it is still frequently used by other relevant communication partners. Then it may be (perceived as a) significant part of an individualâs or organizationâs social capital, leading to low mobility of users from social network sites with a hyper-critical mass, creating a self-stabilizing force in turn. This partially explains the ââseductive powerââ (Oosthuyzen 2012) of such sites, making users stay even if they do not agree with its policies or are unsatisfied with its services. At the same time, it is very difficult for alternative SNS providers to compete with this accumulated power which also attracts third-party services like apps. So, although the functionality of a SNS is increased when it concentrates a vast number of users, such a monopoly-like market situation comes at a price. In the academic context, this is particularly troubling when the SNS is outside the influence of the academic realm. Commercial providers like Facebook do not only have a questionable privacy policy, they also hardly let users participate in the platform designâespecially when it comes to such specific needs as scientific ones. Science-specific SNS are more likely to take this into account but they are still mostly in the hand of companies who ultimately decide about the platformâs design, policy, and existence. The worst case scenario is, of course, that a service is shut down because it is not profitable or does not fit anymore to a companyâs"

A working vaccine would have been a perfect outcome in this disruptive struggle for power between the researcher and his virus ($ â a). In that case, the phage would have ended his discontent, his anonymity, by making him famous, turning his life into a success story after all. But the idea of medical benefits functions as a faÃ§ade, a pretext for his urge to dominate nature in her most elementary (viral and microbial) dimensions, working himself into a state of neurasthenia â in accordance with Dostoyevskyâs insistence that intellectual activity is, in final instance, a âdiseaseâ (1864/1972, p. 18). In conclusion, we are not confronted with a moral dilemma in the sense of a problem that can be solved by developing or abiding to rules and regulations, such as the codes of conduct and ethical principles of research with human subjects. Although such practices (developed by professional ethicists) may help to subdue the tension, making microbial research more manageable no doubt, they will not abolish the basic divide. The desire to control life may become addictive precisely because it is driven by a disruptive compulsion. As a science novel, Arrowsmith opens up and dramatizes this basic rupture, thus furthering our awareness of the gap between what basic research produces and what clinical medicine basically needs. And this divide not only affects the knowledge dimension, but the normative dimension (the level of morality and of the Self) as well. According to Arrowsmith, what is considered integrity in the realm of basic research is regarded as misconduct in medical practice, and vice versa. But this may not the final word. Arrowsmith is the first real science novel, as we have seen. In the next sections we will explore how these tensions are addressed in other novels, notably in Chap. 7 (Cantorâs dilemma) and Chap. 9 (Intuition)."

Most people seem to feel that way. The likelihood of starting a diet is, for example, higher when the diet program is framed as a one-year plan rather than a 365-day plan [35]. If you find this effect amusing, an even more remarkable and frightening result was reported in a study on judges [36]. Active trial judges were given hypothetical cases and asked to decide what would be the appropriate length of the prison sentences for the offenders. One group of judges was asked to give sentences in months and the other group was asked to give sentences in years. The average length of the sentences, when given in years, was 9.7 years, whereas the average length of the sentences for the same crimes, when given in months, corresponded to 5.5 years (66 months). So, if you happen to commit a crime, you should really hope that the judge gives your sentence in months, or, perhaps even better, in weeks or days, rather than in years. If we feel that 365 days or 12 months is longer than one year, we should also think that it is possible to complete more work in the same time frame when the prediction"
46,11,0.941,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"consider very useful and rich for evaluating child poverty, quite naturally leads to a focus on developed countries with functioning democracies and institutions which, despite all their problems and weaknesses, (still) provide a solid social structure for large parts of their citizenry, especially if they are compared to states where almost no infrastructure and only minimal state support is available. Most philosophers in the field developed their theories in regard to such contexts, and many discussions still relate to nation states and âinternalâ distributions of goods, isolated from relationships between countries. We agree that it is important to extend these theories to the domain of global justice and world poverty, and attempts to do so have substantially enriched the theoretical landscape in the last years. In the last chapter, we will therefore briefly address some of the additional questions arising in relation to evaluating extreme forms of child poverty in the developing world. Our book is located within a certain approach of normative reasoning and thinking about poverty: namely, the capability approach and its most influential representatives, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. The capability approach has many advocates and certainly also many critics, and we neither hope nor aim to defend it against all of them. Our goal in this book is to apply the approach to a specific topic. Therefore, we will not be able to scrutinize it on a general and fundamental level; we leave these intellectual battles to others. Still, we will say much about the capability approach, how it should be applied to children and what additional value it brings for the analysis and critique of child poverty. As a consequence, we will bring forward several arguments that speak in favor of the approach in general and support many of its assumptions. The capability approach seems a good starting point for our examination, not only because it can provide the normative underpinnings for our goals but also because it is widely used in a variety of academic disciplines as well as policymaking. When it comes to academia, it is extensively discussed, developed, applied and criticized not only in philosophy but also in economics, social policy, political science and development studies, which confirms its interdisciplinary usefulness. A no less influential document than the Human Development Report, which is published annually by the United Nations and monitors human development on a global level, explicitly draws on the capability approach, even if some have questioned how accurately the report represents its theoretical and normative background (Pogge 2002). On the national level, too, governments are interested in the approach and apply it for diverse purposes; the reports on poverty and wealth in Germany (Arndt and Volkert 2006) and the reports of the United Kingdomâs National"

It was interesting to hear that for her, not the rural people but the urbanites have spoilt Mostar. Minela finds the way the urban population looks down on rural newcomers unacceptable, especially given the fact that the latter have defended Mostar with their lives and made it possible for the pre-war urban population to return to their hometown. Indeed, she blames those who refer to themselves as pravi Mostarci for the decay of the city as well as of moral values. For her, rural people are much more civilised (kulturniji) than the urbanites. She pointed out that in the villages surrounding Mostar the streets are cleaner, the gardens are better looked after and that generally villagers care to keep their properties tidier. This attitude in Minela is closely connected to a value system that, besides tidiness, includes respect for others, acknowledgement of authority (especially of children towards adults) as well as social responsibility. The decay of this value system she ascribes not only to the urban population but also to a general trend that came with the war or, to be more precise, with the end of the war. In contrast to Aida, who only mourns her lost home and does not attribute any good qualities to the life that came thereafter, Minela does seeâ although on a rather abstract levelâpositive developments that came with the break-up of Yugoslavia, especially in regard to the awakening of Bosniak national identity. When Minela talks about her Bosniak identity she does so with pride. In contrast to Aida, a central part of being Bosniak for Minela is to be a practising Muslim.3 For her and her family, religion became very important during the war and has played a crucial role for them ever since. âThere was only God who could save youâ, Minela told me.

51,179,0.941,How Generations Remember,"In this excerpt, the lecturer reinforces his disapproval of nationally divided universities. He claims that even so-called national subjects do not have to be taught separately so long as they are based on objective science. In the case of history, the lecturer argues that objective history is possible only if one excludes (national) emotions. If history is based on facts and excludes emotions, it can be objective and therefore attractive to all students regardless of their nationality. However, when we examine the last paragraph of the interview cited above, it becomes evident that the decision of what is defined as an objective fact lies solely with the respective historian. It is the authority his words are granted that enables him to claim objective history for himself while denying it to a national counterpart. As will be explored further in the remainder of the chapter, the victimisation of the Bosniak people is at the centre of the Bosniak local history representation. This is also the point from which the lecturer begins his narration, as indicated in his last paragraph cited above, in which he legitimises what happened to the Bosniaks as objective historical fact by using phrases such as âhistorical tragedyâ, a âtrue tragedyâ and âobjectively one true tragedyâ in the same sentence. As I will explore in the next section, the Bosniaks, unlike the Croats, do not draw the same conclusion about their perceived historical role as victims."

378,162,0.941,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"The beauty of this transformation was that there were far fewer limitations on the amount of money that could be created. But how did this impact the functions of money? This is the key question that Marx was looking at and he showed that the useful public good or social illusion was slowly but surely turned into a private commodity serving the accumulation of ever more ï¬nancial wealth in any form. For Marx, this was one of the essential and speciï¬c features of a capitalist market economy in comparison to other forms of market economies. His original use of the term âcapitalâ expresses the objectiï¬cation of value in the form of ï¬nancial âproductsâ that enable people to not only spend money on buying other commodities but also to apply it, with the sole aim of accumulating more money. Marx expressed the difference by turning the normal money function around: C-M-Câ (the purpose of money is to serve a higher input/output goal of creating something with more use value) becomes M-C-Mâ in which the purpose of money is to make more money. It is applied in any economic transaction that promises more exchange value and thus more ï¬nancial return on investment (Marx 1887: 102â108). What is actually done in this process becomes secondary. Prior to Polanyiâs ï¬ctitious commodities, Marx showed how âï¬nancial capitalâ becomes an input factor just like all the goods whose value it should express. The analogy expressing what he called a socioeconomic âcrazinessâ was the general genus of âthe animal.â Imagine a world in which it would suddenly come to life and interact with lions, tigers, rabbits and all the other creatures that this term had been created to subsume (Heinrich 2005, 76). Making money a âvalue objectâ destined to be sold in markets is the incarnation of an abstract idea that turns debt into wealth. This new commodity, however, is the most desirable of all as long as the conversion belief holds strongly. It does not rot, it needs little room for storage and promises to transform itself into any use value at any time. And for those with more money than their own need satisfaction requires, its application creates even more money without much actual work being required. In several languages we have the expression âmake your money work for you,â which refers to money invested purely to generate interest. This became a strong desire in accumulation-seeking individuals and soon we saw the emergence of private banks and lending organizations. This is where the âpublic goodâ concept of the way a ï¬nancial sector should be set up was very beneï¬cial, although it no longer reflects reality. Public goods serve all of society, so a ï¬nancial sector designed from this perspective would have the role of ensuring that credit could flow where it was needed for use value generation. As a consequence, the fewer the costs involved in accomplishing this service, the"

Frequently, memories of a time they have not experienced themselves acquire a touch of unreality when recalled by young Mostarians. Such stories are somewhat absurd to them, exotic and sometimes, even amusing. Therefore it might be more accurate to talk about ârecallingâ than ârememberingâ, with the latter including a heightened emotional component.

It would be highly problematic if that capability would be granted to children at all ages, as it would put them at high risk. The same is true for the capability of practical reason and that children should be able to plan their own lives. This is certainly not possible in the same way as it is and should be for adults. Likewise, political participation, having the right to seek employment and to hold property are highly problematic for children, especially younger ones; these are not proper capabilities for them. If we think in terms of functionings instead of capabilities, which is more adequate for young children, these items on the list become even more problematic. Other capabilities are suitable for children, like health and education, but they should be interpreted in terms of functionings rather than capabilities, and they have to be adapted in regard to the actual development stage of the child. Basic competencies and knowledge in literacy, math and science are a good thing for a child of school age, but for the first months of life, children need to achieve other functionings first and have certainly other needs. The same inadequacies can be found in regard to Robeynâs list, but that is no wonder, since she drafted it not as a universal list but one with a particular topic in mind: namely, gender injustices; more specifically for adults, not young boys and girls. Being able to work in the labor market is for many children more a threat than a unit of justice; being able to raise children is a very problematic issue for teenagers, and there are many good reasons to assume that reproductive health during adolescence also includes family planning and being protected from unwanted pregnancy. What we would like to make clear is simply that a list for children has to look different than a list for adults, even though there are some very important overlaps. We now want to present and discuss six criteria for selecting functionings and capabilities that matter for children for the issue of social justice: (1) A functioning or capability that is used for an analysis of injustice has to reflect a truly important dimension of a childâs well-being or well-becoming; in this sense, it has to be child-specific. Justice for children is concerned with things that really matter for them and not with supplements or âextrasâ. As we have seen, the category of functionings is at first a formal one, and in theory, one could make it a question of justice if a child is able to whistle or stand on her head. This would, however, be a distortion of the concept of justice, which should look at functionings that make a substantial difference to a childâs well-being and well-becoming.

For the men, modern gender equality is fundamentally at odds with their own life project as it makes their own form of masculinityâand the sacrifices that came with itâworthless. It also makes their idealised stay-at-home wives the targets of critique. They are occupied with the crumbling moral order in many areas and trace this decay back to the material greed of modern times, where people expect to get everything in their lap without having to work for it. As we have seen, their critique of modern times is epitomised by their worry about the increasing prevalence of divorces. However, these old men are also aware that things have changed since they established their own families. Some of them help their wives more in the household now after they have they retired, and think this is fair but not easy to learn at such a late age.5 Their investment in the gender complementary model is much stronger than the womenâs and they strive to reconcile this with the new times. Behind their worry for young mothers today we discern compassion with their own hardworking mothers, whereas the discontent of the women of their own generation seems to have gone more or less unnoticed. Martin, who idealised the female homemaker in his own marriage, says: Now itâs more even. Man and wife are more on the same footing. Often they both work. My daughter-in-lawâand then he has to help with various things at home. Before they got married too. Inside as well, when she is at work and comes home at 16.30. And they have two children. So itâs much more even now. It wasnât like that back then. The wife didnât work, outside the home. Thereâs probably more of that today, but it could result in the wife being more overworked when she both has a salaried job and has to keep the home. Q: Yes, because she is still responsible for the home? Yes, you never get away from that, that equality that the husband does the same things, looking after the children or those things. And we are probably not Statistics from 1988 onwards indicate a clear rise in positive attitudes to equal sharing of housework and childcare in all cohorts. For instance, the percentage of the cohort born 1931â1934 who thought housework should be shared equally rose from 38 per cent in 1988 to 52 per cent in 2008 (Hansen and Slagsvold 2012: Table 6.2)."

It can also bring to light that which might otherwise have remained hidden and untouched in the dark, because it is confrontational, painful, and threatening. The power of the gaze can cause calamities. It can objectify others, betray, curse, and cut. As the saying goes, a look can even kill. One involuntary gaze into the eyes of Medusa can turn you to stone, and fear of the evil eye is found in almost all cultures reaching back to the beginning of history. Another momentary gaze is needed for interplay on stage. This is another desire altogether. Perhaps it has its roots in the âpenetrating eyesâ related to Dionysus,29 which inspire and are the source of the bottomless reservoir of creativity. It is a gaze meant to challenge, not harm, others, not even by the distortions of idealizing. It is open to and unafraid of the future, and is therefore not a slave to the prejudices that dazzle and delude us and judge Others without seeing what they can do. Instead, it is fundamentally welcoming to the Other and wants to open all options for him, make all avenues possible. Such a gaze is fundamentally generous and passionate, willing to risk a love-gaze and trusting that it will be able to distinguish strange from stranger, so that it does not expose itself naively to the destructive Other. And if Medusa does stare back â something that has been known to happen even in the most beauteous temples of the muses â the gaze is averted in time or lets itself come to the test. For who, in the kairos of time, has exhibited more potency â Eros the matchmaker or the demon Negativity? When the interplay goes well, Eros has a good chance. In the kairos of the moment, the gazes of homo ludens lock on stage in the shared eros of the creativity of the muses. And what kind of coupling would it be if one cut the other off in the name of his own pleasure and advantage? That would be a poor showing and not a felicitous act, even if one of the two, much acclaimed, believed himself to be the winner. Victorious moments, gazed upon in theater and smiled upon by the muses, have another look to them. They are not self-centered nor do they know self-denial. Rather they are fed by the understanding that 29 Walter Otto, Dionysus Myth and Cult, trans. Walter Palmer (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1965), 90."
378,173,0.941,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"So what could become the major goal instead? Summarizing twenty-ï¬rst century research about human needs and how to align them with natureâs qualities brings us very close to the differentiated framework of sufï¬ciency of Sachs. He suggested it as early as the 1990s, and I did not anticipate this resemblance when I began to write the book. For Sachs, sufï¬ciency goes far beyond simply having less stuff. It tackles several unsustainable trends of the current development paradigm at once. In the framework he differentiates four âEâsâ in German (Entschleunigung, Entflechtung, EntrÃ¼mpelung, and Entkommerzialisierung), which I would translate as four âDâsâ: Deceleration, Deglobalization, Decluttering, and Decommodiï¬cation. In a book on sufï¬ciency policies another translator has called them the âfour Lessensâ because these concepts âexpress the idea that we need to lessen our speed, our distance, the encumbrance of our acquired possessions, and the role of commerce and the market in our livesâ (Schneidewind/Zahrnt 2014: 30). I like the four Dâs and summarize the key stance behind them by drawing on terms that were introduced and discussed in this chapter: â¢ Decelerationâendless efï¬ciency and increasing speed in all areas of production and consumption reduce experienced utility and increase vulnerability of production chains; â¢ Deglobalizationâprice-driven fragmentation of production chains and transnational corporate units across the globe boosts proï¬ts but widely externalizes ecological costs and avoids fair taxation; â¢ Declutteringârunning after ever more stuff in competition with others reduces the ability to really connect and enjoy each one of our items and also overstretches the Earthâs carrying capacity; â¢ Decommercializationâapplying mental models of commodities and ï¬nancial beneï¬ts to all relationships leads to less quality of life, less concern for others or the environment, and keeps governance blind to the physical and psychological realities behind the numbers. We can take more care of what we have, distribute it more sensibly and thoroughly, and innovate our production and consumption systems so they bring us into a safe and just operating space. There clearly is enough to go round. Spending patterns show that there is room for the reorientation of already existing wealth without ruining lives. We do not need ever more output. We need different business models, market patterns, money systems and the courage to let go of the exhausting narrative that we are insatiable egoists trapped in a constant competitive race over accumulation for accumulationâs sake and a fear of falling behind. The good news is that the wider context of what could shape into a Second Enlightenment movement holds this potential: â¢ Emphasis lies on reflexivity that takes circumstances into account when undertaking intellectual and empirical investigations. â¢ Social sciences and the role of spirituality return to the realms of understanding and explaining development patterns of the world."

They were prepared to share the houseworkâbut if the wife were at home, it would be quite natural that she would take care of it, Morten said at 18 as well as at 30. It was also OK to a certain degree that the wife would earn more than themâas long as it did not make her aloof and they themselves were not expected to stay at home.

The formal layout of this book suggests that I perceive of the caregiver discourse as much more evidently gendered than the patient discourse. Still, we are compelled to ask, whether male as compared to female patients generally portray their condition differently; whether such a difference goes beyond the telling of a purportedly seamless narrative, the artistic exploitation of their condition, or the formal underplaying of their concerns. In Chap. 5, I look at narratives offered by patients who published their stories once the Alzheimerâs patient movement had fully taken off. This gives me the opportunity to investigate more deeply whether the patient discourse is as strictly gendered as the caregiver discourse seems to be, and whether there are forms of dementia life-writing that enable patients to remain true to their narrative abilities, bringing poetics and politics in unison."

Crossâs succinct responses supported Barbara and the nurses. Cross reinforced the need to investigate hospitals rather than individuals and that nurses feared reprisals. When Michelmore challenged her about why ex-nurses did not complain, she replied: âHow much credence would you give, say, an ex-television producer, who came and said âterrible things went on in my studio when I was there ï¬ve years agoâ? . . . being an ex-anything immediately reduces your case.â Allsop interviewed Robinson, allowing him the ï¬nal word. Robinson said he would investigate if he received sufï¬cient evidence. However, Robinson defended the NHS, and reiterated his conï¬dence in the system: âI am absolutely sure, that the care of our old people in our geriatric and psychiatric hospitals is as good as anything in the world.â It was ironical to make such a comment, which lacked corroboration,34 in the context of criticising AEGIS for its unsubstantiated evidence. He said he wanted to investigate the allegations, but was concerned that, eighteen months after the events âthe trail is getting coldâ, indicating his concern about identifying individual wrong-doers. Allsop, reiterating Crossâs point, challenged him on this focus on incidents, rather than on investigating a general malaise in the hospitals, but Robinson stuck to his plan. The press picked up on Robinsonâs apparent lack of knowledge, or denial, of poor care in hospitals and his attitude to the allegations. The Sunday Mirror criticised Robinson, who, âto his shame, seemed to pooh-pooh [Sans Everything] on Twenty-Four Hoursâ (Allen 1967). The BBC received a âï¬oodâ of letters. Some people objected to the programme repeating the criticisms made in Sans Everything. Some complained about anonymising hospitals and silhouetting interviewees. However, many more thought the BBC was right to bring the matter into the open. Some letter writers recounted their experiences in hospitals, as patients, staff or visitors. One nurse, who wrote that her ward sister told her to âslingâ a patient in the bath even if she didnât want one, complained to matron, was ostracised by staff and left the hospital. She said: âI was getting tough, hard-hearted, I had lost my individuality...I had lost the kindly world I belonged to.â A son wrote about his elderly motherâs care.

310,53,0.941,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"Here, the reader commenting on the article categorises the LGBT community as engaging in nonsensical activities. In order to understand the defence mechanism at play here, we need to focus on the event described in the article, the gay parade, which the reader seems to be hostile to (despite him/her stating that everyone is free to privately express their sexuality). This hostility manifests itself not only in relation to LGBT community members but also to anyone supporting them (e.g. the mayor and city council). This extension towards anyone related to this social group represents a mechanism of generalisation juxtaposing âI, myselfâ from âthemâ, thus highlighting the fear of an attack to oneâs own identity. On the one hand, the commenter seems to be in favour of sexual freedom as a commonsense principle for all individuals, but then on the other, ironically labels gay parades as âridiculous nonsenseâ. We would like now to go through an example of a xenophobic comment taken from the Italian weekly news magazine Lâespresso, addressed against the Roma community, which is often discriminated against in Italy: (3) Quando vedrÃ² un ROM onesto nevicherÃ  il 15 di Agosto! Eâ lâora di farsi sentire, di far capire a questa feccia che prima vengono i diritti degli onesti cittadini e poi i loro. Non se ne puÃ² piÃ¹ di vivere col terrore che ti vengano a svaligiare casa, causandoti molti danni per pochi euro di refurtiva. Basta!!! Che se ne tornino nei Balcani, devono capire che lâItalia deve essere un paese deromizzato.3 When I see an honest Roma person it will be snowing on the 15th August! Itâs time to raise the voice. The time has come to make this scum understand that the rights of honest citizens come ï¬rst and then theirs follow. Enough with living with the fear of burglars who cause lots of damage for just a few euros of loot. Enough!!! Let them go back to the Balkans, they need to understand that Italy has to be deromanised! More so than the previous examples, this comment shows how the phenomenon of stereotype-forming is deeply rooted in society. With a strong emphasis on the use of (cynical) sarcasm, the reader underlines how being honest and being a Roma person is contradictory and essentially âas odd as snow in mid-Augustâ. The readerâs cognitive process follows the line of advocating a common ï¬ght against a foe (âthemâ) with a clear defence strategy of âus honest peopleâ against âthem, dishonest Romaâ (as in the eternal ï¬ght between good and evil). The xenophobic climax is reached with the use of the term âscumâ to deï¬ne the entire Roma group. This is a case where a stereotype is taken to an extreme, becoming prejudice, and where categorisation becomes a hate instrument. Roma people are pointed at as thieves or brigands from whom Italians have to defend themselves. In this sense, a strong nationalism underlies this particular example of categorisation, which is deeply rooted in the readerâs belief that the country needs to be âderomanisedâ.

Deconstructing the own nation through reflecting on the conflict. As mentioned above, political conflicts based on historical representations are very often based on two dimensions. This is to say they have at the same time a national and a recent character. The first feature is not a surprise at all because history education has been traditionally considered an essential piece of most of educational systems since nineteenth century, and even before, to build and maintain national identities. Therefore, it is precisely its national character in interaction with its recency the center of the conundrum to be solved. This is to say any attempt to discuss new information contradicting prior representations, based, for example, on new data obtained by historians, will be facing an intense defensive reaction because citizens national identities will be challenged. But if history education does not go in this direction trying to change stereotypical historical representations there is no way to contribute to conflict reduction and reconciliation. what to do then? This is precisely what previous pages about the teaching of historical narratives have tried to answer. This is to say I have analyzed a six dimensions view of historical narratives emphasizing how each one of them could be approached in such a way that they could help the citizens to contextualize their representations about the past and particularly their view about a monological and essentialist view of past events. As these dimensions have been analyzed before in detail, it is not necessary to consider again their possible contribution to reduce social and political conflicts but I think it is convenient to insist on the dramatic importance of establishment of the historical subject. Usually citizens establish this subject basically through a historical view based on an endurable and almost eternal continuity between themselves and diverse subjects of the past. This is to say when citizens along the world use a âweâ as subject of something that happened in the past they represent themselves as the only and genuine descendants of an idealized historical subject which does not exist anymore. In other words, this âweâ consists of an incredible mixture of present and past but probably most of the citizens are not really conscious of such a mystification. As stated before, the establishment of this imaginary historical subject is probably the nucleus of the rest of the narratives dimensions"

With a negative outcome, the responsible executives would most likely have received criticism for wasting the investorsâ and the ownersâ money to no avail. The research literature acknowledges three categories of moral luck. The most prominent one is resultant moral luck, where the entrepreneur story from the north of Norway and Merck and the river blindness medicine are examples. Then there is constitutive moral luck, which has to do with the elements affecting a personâs character. Nature and nurture, genetic heritage and culture, can affect the extent to which a person is respectful, honest, kind, and benevolent in his or her interactions with other people. Good or bad luck plays a significant part in the formative processes, yet we tend not to take it into account when praising or blaming people for the character traits they have. The third category goes under the name of situational moral luck, and concerns the moral tests a person faces or avoids, and the extent to which character traits become publicly exposed. A person can be morally fortunate to never face situations where her moral weaknesses are exposed, or morally unfortunate to never get a chance to demonstrate personal courage and honesty, since the situations she faces do not call for the application these moral qualities. There is room for a fourth category of moral luck, not yet identified or discussed in the studies of this phenomenon. We can call it relational moral luck, and it concerns the social environment a person finds himor herself in at the time of decision-making. At crucial points in the process of judging and reasoning about what to do, the decision-maker depends on feedback from others, in the form of support or opposition to the ideas that are on the table. In an organization, he or she needs colleagues who intervene and question the assumptions that are present in the reasoning. I return to the concept of relational moral luck in the final chapter of the book, where I dwell more explicitly on the nature of the thought processes that lead from contemplation of options and alternatives, to action, and the extent to which their quality depends on the social side of decision-making. To what extent does moral luck pose a challenge to the coherence of our moral reasoning? Nagel and Williams thought that they identified a deep tension in the way we think about right and wrong when they introduced the concept.

In that moment, the force of a single cry is enough to turn deathly emptiness into hope, or hope into deathly emptiness. Lucilleâs scream in Georg BÃ¼chnerâs drama about the French Revolution is such an outcry.26 Historically, it is the senseless rebellion of the human being who believes he can perhaps stop death at the last second after all. But no one hears him, neither man nor God, and everything continues as usual. The clocks tick, the bees buzz, time trickles away and takes life with it. Camille dies his bloody death on the scaffold, as do Danton and the others. No scream can prevent it. But there is a word that can turn it around. Paul Celan calls it the âcounterword, it is the word that cuts the âstring,â the word that no longer bows down before âthe bystanders and old war-horses of history.ââ27 Lucille dares to speak this counterword. At the very end of the play, sitting on the steps to the guillotine, she cries out to one of the revolutionary guards, âLong live the King!â Are these the words of one who has been driven mad by her loverâs murder? Celan reads it differently, as an act of liberation, a step with a direction. The counterword the actor is able to speak, that does not bow to the bystanders and old warhorses of contemporary or ancient theater history, is how Lucilleâs cries cry out. How, the manner in which this scream is screamed, can be an act of liberation. In this scream, the actor risks the bareness of existence without calculating the effect, not showing off her virtuosity, not following a particular method. This does not mean she has no knowledge of effect, virtuosity ,and methods, but that is not all.

For an action to be autonomous it needs freedom from constraints and ability to comprehend its situation. âPeopleâs actions are rarely, if ever fully autonomousâ [1], however they should have a fairly good knowledge of the modality of treatment or research, its side effects along with its presumed advantages, in order to give an informed consent. The Role of the Family In Asia, Africa, and the Middle East the family plays a major role in medical decisions. The patient whether he is elderly or a young person, has to listen to the opinion of his close family to the mode of treatment he/she is going to accept. In some places in Africa, the elders of the tribe, will decide in serious matter of life and death. The Western attitude of individualism it is not accepted in many societies. In most countries of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East there is no health insurance for the public at large. Usually the family bears the burden of any cost of medical intervention. Similarly there is no welfare state, and hence the breadwinner takes care of the elderly, the children, and ladies. Though females and children may be working at home, and in the ï¬eld, or looking after the cattle and sheep of the family, they are usually not the breadwinners. The role of the family and close friends should be respected in places where they have different philosophies and cultures that differ greatly from Western liberal, individualistic patterns. Even in the West itself, different minorities, e.g., Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis, etc., the role of the family should be respected, as the patients themselves agree to this role, and health providers have to understand that there are different cultures that do not give priority to autonomy, as it is understood in the West. Advice and Waiver Sometimes that patient will say to his doctor: âWhat is your advice in my condition? What would you do if your parent was in my situation? The physician may feel embarrassed, but he/she should be honest and give the sincere advice [5]. The matter may be more complicated when the patient relegates the decision making to the doctor saying: âLook I have trust in you, and whatever you decide I will accept.â The physician should be tactful and try to explain the situation and give information to the patient and/or his family, and reach with them the course to be taken. As far as he can make it, the physician should explain that the decision should be in the hands of the patient (plus his family). He might help by giving all the required data, and even may give his personal advice. In cases where the patient does not want to know the diagnosis, the physician should discuss the condition fully with the family, and let them try to persuade the patient, at least to take part in the decision-making."
117,376,0.94,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"an adequate way to address ethical issues including the ones that refer to caring practices. But critical considerations are also expressed. Erlen argues that nurses who only discuss issues with other nurses might be limited in their focus. Perspectives given by other healthcare workers could challenge the analysis of the conflict and broaden the enquiry. âAlthough all nurses do not hold the same exact philosophy of nursing, there is a greater likelihood that there will be less divergence of perspectives and fewer alternatives presented when an ethics committee is comprised almost entirely of nursesâ (Erlen 1997, p. 59). NECs might encourage division rather than collaboration with other disciplines (Fleming 1997, p. 8). The clinical ethicist, Mary Faith Marshall points out, that ânurses can be their best enemies, â¦ a democratic process should be learnt â¦ (and a) change in practices of local multi-disciplinary committees need to be supported by everyoneâ (Kohlen 2009, p. 157). A closer look reveals that the question could be raised whether the functions of Nursing Ethics Committees are often the responsibility of other committees within the healthcare organizations. Moreover, while some nursing concerns are unique to nursing, most raise broader questions about human well-being that might be better addressed by the institution and the healthcare system at large (Taylor 1997, p. 69). A restricted discussion of these concerns to NECs may end up in their becoming trivialized or even marginalized. And, a separate nursing committee might communicate the image to the institution that these concerns are of lesser importance than those addressed by an interdisciplinary committee. What happens if the committee actually serves to make nurses grow stronger in articulating their thoughts and put their issues of concern on the agenda? Haddad tells her piece of the story in an interview: It created problems over the years because they stood up, collectively, you know, so you got now five people on the unit, and they are not only five people, they are five experienced people because usually people that volunteer for this had been there a while. And now we are going through years of running the committee, and learning a language and all that. Then you got five people who were saying, we are not going to put up with this. They started to present problems (and there came a new director). She was"

In this case a woodpecker has been trained to whisk eggs using its powerful head movements. Qualitative analysis of the results of this ï¬rst pilot study showed some very interesting principles were involved in combining concepts. First, there was evidence for instantiation of superordinate categories to basic level categoriesâbirds became woodpeckers, fruit bananas, and furniture couches. Second, people would align properties and functions between the two concepts. The example given here shows how the need to ï¬nd a function for a kitchen utensil is met by ï¬nding a behavior of a particular bird that can serve the function of a particular utensil. Third, there was evidence for simulation processes, in line with Barsalouâs suggestions about the role of concepts in achieving goals (Barsalou 1991). Commentary provided by the creator of the woodpecker whisk pointed out that it would not need electrical power (good for camping trips) but would on the other hand be unhygienic. The use of simulation takes the speciï¬cation of the combined concept and develops it in totally non-compositional directions, as the new concept is adapted to real world knowledge. Finally, many solutions identiï¬ed conflicting properties in the newly combined concept, and offered new emergent features to resolve them. For example, when a participant solved âA fruit that is also a kind of furnitureâ by proposing a banana couch, they went on to specify that the banana had been modiï¬ed to grow very large and to ripen very slowly. Extensional accounts of meaning focus on the sets of exemplars in the world. As such they can have nothing to say about concepts which have no members. (The problem of empty and ï¬ctional names is well known, Braun 2005). Thus when we think about counter-factual or hypothetical objects, the extension has to be taken to refer not to the actual world but to a virtual or âpossibleâ world. Computer teacups do not currently exist, but it is possible to imagine an alternative world in which they do, and we can speculate about their properties. In fact this process of conceptual combination may be a key factor in innovation and creativity. In a recent paper (Gibbert et al. 2012) my colleagues and I investigated creativity in the forming of concepts of hybrid productsâartifacts that serve more than one traditional function. In direct agreement with the processes postulated by the Composite Prototype Model we showed how ï¬rst attempts to imagine (say) a pillow that was also a telephone would simply aggregate the features of the two concepts into a composite. However when the two concepts being combined were sufï¬ciently dissimilar, then a second attempt at combining the concepts would generate integrative solutions in which features of one concept would be aligned with those of the other to provide emergent functionality. The telephone could be programmed to provide gentle sounds to help people get to sleep, or the pillow could gently move to alert the user that a phone call was arriving. A less kind proposal was that the pillow would allow one to nap while listening to oneâs mother on the phone. When people were able to generate integrative solutions, these were consistently judged to be more likely to succeed as marketable products."
271,542,0.94,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"this is too much for me. I donât have time for that. And then I realizeâand this was an aspect you also mentioned at the beginning: digital world. I believe everything we accelerate: transcribing, typing with the computer and so on. All this always returns as a problem in the form of this flood of possibilities. (P3: 1712â1721) Possibly, the interviewee would have mentioned this irritation in her conduct of life irrespective of the impulse to reflect upon a changing media environment and her own media repertoire. However, there are indicators that the implicitly stated research interest stimulated the consideration of this. The reference to the impulse given in the introduction to the interview implies that this inspired the respondent to make the connection between her reflections and the changing media environment. At the same time, the implicitly set stimulus did not overshadow her own relevance structure, which is supported by the fact that the topic came up in the course of her statement and was not triggered by a direct enquiry. Consequently, the implicit naming of the media-related research interest can produce an adequate balance. With this third interviewing strategy, we further observed that the enquiry about media-related topics only at the end of the interview came as a surprise for the interviewees, who were attuned to the announced five sets of questions, and tended to be tired by the end of the interview. Thus, it is likely that they answered the respective questions in a less elaborate and committed way than previous ones. Moreover, it can be assumed that at the end, the respondents were no longer aware of, or were not able to recollect, all aspects of the previously discussed life spheres and, hence, responded in a way that does not allow for separate conclusions for the different life spheres under study. Consequently, the interviewees might neglect crucial aspects, meaning that the retrospective questions yield less detail. Interviewing strategy 4 implicitly stating the media-related research interest plus enquiries after each set of questions dealing with one of the life spheres Applying the fourth interviewing strategy, we stated our interest in the role of changing media environments and repertoires for the respondentsâ conduct of life only implicitly using the same formulation as in strategy 3 (see above)."

As researchers integrated in a research community, we want to build and maintain a social network of partners that we collaborate with. As our interests and ideas change and evolve, our social network should follow and sometimes even lead, as meeting new people may trigger new directions in our research. In any case, we need a flow of exchange with our social network of partners. Exchange of ideas and knowledge, exchange via publications, sharing of program code, sharing via presentations and teaching, sharing via people visiting. In order to ensure conditions for performing research, we need stable funding possibly spread over different kind of sources. This requires good skills in developing research ideas in a way that is suitable for funding agencies, often approaching it in a collaborative way to apply for joint projects. As the priorities in funding agencies regularly shift, we also need flexibility to recognize opportunities for our research potential under different funding umbrellas."

In a letter116 G. expressed gratitude to the Director and one of the psychiatrists, Anselmo Sacerdote, for their help in convincing his brother to give him a sum of money that presumably would allow him to buy cigarettes, newspapers and other small items while interned. He managed to meet the Director on several occasions and he always addressed him with kindness and respect in his letters. There is no mention in his files that he was forced to work and there is no indication of any treatment. In fact, it is plausible to say that he was not given any. In this, he would not be totally exceptional: the institution in itself, the asylumâs discipline and forced labour, called ergotherapy,117 were considered therapeutic, internment was the medicine apart from cases where sedation or restraints were thought to be necessary. Like in a prison, time was thought to be the cure, the institutionâs discipline would straighten behaviour and shape character, work would teach self-esteem: needless to add that, within this mentality, punishment and intimidation could find a therapeutic justification. At the beginning of the twentieth century, prior to electro-shock, introduced in the late 1930s, the main clinical therapies consisted of clinotherapy (keeping the patient in bed), hydrotherapy (prolonged baths in hot, warm or cold water) or shock-based cures such as insulin-induced coma or convulsions caused by Cardiazol. Schizophrenia was treated with inoculation of parasites responsible for malaria, that gave very high temperatures and subsequent fits. The assumption behind it was that, as epileptics were observed to never be schizophrenic, if schizophrenics experienced artificially provoked fits similar to epileptic ones, they would be cured.118 Otherwise, the patient was simply observed and commented upon, his progress, or lack thereof, was remarked, but very little else happened. Doctors seem to have left G. in peace. Maybe, while on the surface they could not be seen to side with him, some of them thought he had been unjustly interned. In a letter, G. indicated that he would have liked to be invited to a conversation that had taken place between his brother and the Director.119 Since we know from G.âs words that the brother never paid him a visit, the conversation with Rivano is likely to have been an exchange of opinions between colleagues and perhaps it was interpreted as an overstepping the line, an intrusion into another professionalâs sphere. Besides, it is not totally unlikely that, among the Collegno medical staff, there was some discontent with the custody role allocated to psychiatry: Rivano was in touch with the world and was certainly aware of the debate that was taking place in Italy on the issue. As observed earlier, many professionals were resenting"
162,77,0.94,The Cost of Insanity in Nineteenth-Century Ireland,"Sligo also received paying patients for as little as Â£10 per annum. Based on his experiences, McMunn prescribed a superior mode of care for paying patients, recommending that the ârate-payers must pay the additional expenseâ incurred. He asserted that patients should be treated in a manner âas near as possible to what they were accustomed toâ. Thus, he stated, while pauper patients would receive their âordinary breakfastâ of porridge, âif a patient was accustomed to tea at home for breakfast, I would give him teaâ. When one commissioner mockingly enquired whether McMunn might extend this âto allow a man a carriage to drive in because he had been accustomed to oneâ, McMunn disagreed. He did not share the concerns of several of his fellow resident physicians about the potential for jealousy between patients.120 other asylum physicians and managers took pains to justify their preferential treatment of paying patients. Like McMunn, they framed their actions in terms of their moral obligation to accommodate patients in accordance with their previous living standards. For example, while the Ballinasloe asylumâs manager, John B. MâKiernan, placed non-violent paying patients in a âbetter classâ in the house, âamongst the quiet and orderlyâ, he attributed this to: a moral point of view, as regards their moral treatment, thinking they have been accustomed to more comforts than they would have in this asylum"

386,58,0.94,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"funds for such re-education had to be closed because only a handful of farmers had subscribed in all the years of its existence. The typical person abandoning his farm is 60â70 years old and enters retirement rather than a new job. And the farm will usually not be abandoned if there is a son (or perhaps a daughter) who is willing to take it over. This completes our mental journey from inter-generational relations towards economistsâ concern about structural change in agriculture. In essence, structural change in agriculture is a story about successful or failed farm successions. And these successions usually occur between the different generations on a farm. In order to illustrate this system, it may be useful to enter the world of theoretical modelling. While this requires a degree of abstraction, it may clarify the very relationship between farm succession and structural change. Let us first focus on determinants of the personal decision to take over a farm. In line with Rosenâs model (1986), we assume two kinds of jobs to choose between: uia = Wia + ni"
310,89,0.94,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"To begin with, the commenter here does draw the line at parents forcibly sending their children to NARTH (National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality), an organisation that offers gay conversion therapy, thus, recognising the danger that such therapy can bring on LGBTIQ youth. However, the language used in the rest of the comment indicates a strong negative stance toward homosexuality and a profound ignorance of LGBTIQ issues. Firstly, the user refers to non-straight sexual desires as âunwantedâ¦urgesâ. Both these words have negative connotations and imply something unfavourable. Moreover, by way of the modal verb âshouldâ, the user offers a suggestion for people with such âurgesâ to âget helpâ. In doing so, the user implies that heteronormative values are hegemonic and any deviation from them creates an urgent need for the individual to seek help. Finally, the use of the inclusive âorâ in the sentence âWhether those urges are for men or young boys, it shouldnât matter.â strongly implicates that, in the mind of the commenter, homosexuality is on a par with paedophilia and thus warrants âtreatment.â In view of all this, then, the ï¬nal, positive, statement that parents should not force their children to undergo gay conversion therapy is overshadowed by the overall negative stance the user has towards the LGBTIQ community. Similarly, the comment in (32), which was made in response to a newspaper article about the civil union of a gay couple, might not seem at ï¬rst to be overly discriminatory. Yet, if we break it down into its component parts and discern the meaning beneath the allusions being used therein, we might form a different opinion. (32) people marry because they fall in love, and although itâs a choice, it was meant to be like that even in the animal kingdom, for example swans mate for life, male and female, not male and male.38 The user that posted this comment may posit the idea that marriage is a choice, but frames the relevant clause with the conjunction âalthoughâ (a conventional implicature Ã  la Grice), which is generally used to present two contrastive arguments, thus indicating that even though marriage is a choice for people who fall in love, it is also a choice that comes with restrictions. By bringing in a comparison with mating in the animal kingdom, whereby all swan relationships are described as being heterosexual, the commenter subscribes to heteronormative ideals, implying in this way that any deviation from the heterosexual norm is unnatural. So, even though this comment concedes that marriage is a choice, somewhat echoing the main argument of most gay rights movements on the matter, it still exhibits a negative attitude towards the members of the LGBTIQ community. Clearly, this short section cannot do justice to the far-reaching implications that that the study of indirectness can have for our understanding of discrimination in language use. What we hope to have achieved through this discussion of some online reactions to news items in the Maltese press is to have justiï¬ed the need for going beyond the explicitly expressed and overtly communicated meaning when it"
163,137,0.94,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"concLusion Following Mary Douglasâs initial concerns about human solidarity being created by exchanging, it is valid to ask whether such solidarity is possible in Sweden with the current tax law in place. If BÃ¶rje is right about that people have always exchanged, to change peopleâs behaviour is not that easy for the state, especially if they have to pay more dearly for it. But as we have seen, the Agency has actually succeeded in implementing a simplified tax system while also concealing issues that are difficult to legitimize. Most importantly they aim to treat people equitably. This increases reciprocity. Like most other people in the world Swedes continuously exchange. Yet direct exchanges between people keep the state outside the deal. Such exchanges are justifiable among the Limningers as long as they are not too organized or happen too often, do not have too much value, are not performed by professionals in their working time or by a complete stranger. When Limningers talk about cash payments for informal purchases, it is the small and almost negligible amounts that are acceptable; aspects of unacceptability appear in the size of the deal, the type of recompense and the organizational form. The Limningers know about the law, but donât pay too much attention to it if certain conditions are in place. The acceptable purchase of svart arbete is private and hidden, but set against a public reference to what constitutes economic activities. For example, bartering, in the sense of keeping money out of the deal, makes the direct exchanges more acceptable. Yet even if money is sometimes used, there are many ways to justify this, for example by invoking a closer relationship. Settling the exchange with money makes the links to market and state more pertinent, and the svart deal becomes more explicitly an act of cheating. Therefore, even cash-settled deals are often referred to as barters in order to create a reverse disentanglement, away from the formal market and closer to the realm of social exchange. The Agency seems to go along with thisâunless provoked, as it was with Svenâs, the employee expert, test of limits before an exchange was recognized as taxable. What he tested was how close the relationship between exchangers can be and how small a value the exchange can amount to. In this case the Agency read the law to the letter, but it mostly let such exchanges pass. As seen above, it knows that there is a myriad of exchanges that ought to be subject to tax assessment according to a strict interpretation of the law. For various reasons these exchanges should not be subject to tax: they are not publicly spoken about, as it would be seen as an intrusion into peopleâs everyday lives; these exchanges create and"
114,290,0.94,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"The foundational ideas which have informed our thinking are essentially quite simple but hard won in the sense that they are not for the most part embedded in current thinking. We have argued that we need to view safety through the patientâs eyes and that safety needs to be approached very differently in the varying settings along the patient journey. This implies in turn that we need to think more explicitly about what kind of safety strategies are most useful in different contexts. We can now draw these themes together and consider the new directions that emerge. In this chapter we first review the ideas and arguments of the book and summarise the transitions in patient safety that we believe are needed (Box 11.1). We then set out a compendium of safety and risk management strategies which can be selected, combined and customised to any healthcare setting. Box 11.1. Five Transitions for Patient Safety"
117,109,0.94,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Enabling Autonomy From this perspective, making up oneâs mind and acting autonomously does not consist in determining and following contingently given preferences and being equipped with relevant factual knowledge. Rather, forming an autonomous will means taking part in an ongoing dialogue. This dialogue need not be restricted to verbal communication and it need not always take place between co-present interlocutors. Convictions may be expressed nonverbally and affectively, and one may find convincing attitudes and perspectives in books, films or other media. In any case, when forming a will, one is positioning oneself in this dialogue and finding oneâs own standpoint and voice. Respecting autonomy thus initially requires safeguarding the ability to develop and enact autonomy, that is to say granting the other person a place in the debate, listening, revealing oneâs own perspective and taking the time to let the exchange evolve. At some later point, then, respecting autonomy will also entail refraining from intervening if a person has decided themselves that these actions do not harm others. In the medical context, these presuppositions of autonomy can be translated into calls for caution and attention. For example, before following a patientâs request to end life-prolonging or life-saving treatment, one ought to make sure that the patient has had time to think for themselves, the opportunity to talk to others, and, not least, that they are assured that their future existence and well-being matters. The latter entails that once a patient has reached a final decision, this decision must be regarded as authoritative. However, it also entails that the patient be assured that they will not be left alone or be perceived as a burden, should they decide to accept treatment. Respecting autonomy thus incorporates an orientation towards wellbeing. It is directed at physical, psychological, and social presuppositions"
13,364,0.94,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Many of the young men mention this too. Women should have access to the same jobs, salaries, rights and careers as men, but then women should also have the same duties or take their share of the unattractive and hard traditional male jobs. Vegard says at 18: âif weâre to have gender equality, then there should be equality all the wayâ. The young men point to the danger of reversed discrimination, because then nothing has been attained. Egil was the only man in the middle generation who explicitly mentioned fathersâ rights at divorce. This argument has become ubiquitous among the men in the youngest generation and may tell us that the power balance between men and women is no longer experienced as unambiguous. At 30 many of those interviewed, especially the women, but also some of the men, have experienced gender discrimination against women in education and work, something they were surprised about and find unacceptable. Morten says that he at any time would prefer a female boss compared to all those messy men he has met during his career until now. He thinks, however, that women have the same possibilities so he is not particularly engaged in gender-equality politics. Anders had experienced mean male bonding against women in one of his work places, âa very conservative place, a shipping firm, incredibly unsympatheticâ. Still, like almost all of the other men, he is against quotas, because he thinks they ought to be totally unnecessary and he fears that they will not be an effective remedy against discriminatory attitudes. Conversely, Kim experienced that gender-equality politics gave him career advantages as a preschool teacher, which he found legitimate because he thinks it is a good thing to have more men in this profession. At 30 many of the women acknowledge that gender quotas are unfortunately necessary. Like many others, Kine has seen how much more easily men get promotions and salary rises. It is so âbloody unjust!â she exclaims and echoes her grandmother Karenâs anger at the injustice of her brotherâs privileges. Tonje has experienced female doctors getting much less attendance from the nurses on the hospital wards than male doctors do. But she still wants to believe that âif a women wants gender equality, sheâll make it happenâ.

46,45,0.94,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"1.2 Selecting functionings and capabilities for children The next task to further develop our concept of justice for children is to select functionings â for older children, capabilities â that are relevant for assessments of justice. Sen has never identified a comprehensive list of functionings and capabilities, either for adults or for children, that could be used as the basis for a theory of justice. On the contrary, he has brought forward some reasons why he is skeptical about such an endeavor (Sen 1993; Sen 2004b). He argues that a predefined list of what is valuable to human life ignores what people actually value and might be overly paternalistic. Furthermore, it goes against the ideal of public deliberation processes that Sen sees as the best and the legitimate way to answer value questions. Finally, he suggests that moral questions are notoriously difficult to answer and that this insight, too, speaks against the definition of a full list. Throughout his works, he frequently refers to some examples of capabilities he believes to be supported by a wide range of moral and political positions, which he terms âbasic capabilitiesâ. However, his remarks on this subject remain only exemplary, and all in all, he refrains from substantial claims when it comes to value questions on an abstract and universal level detached from concrete contexts and socioeconomic circumstances. His version of the capability approach is therefore best understood as an âanalytical deviceâ that can be used for different ends. In particular, Sen reminds us that evaluative"

But, and this is whatâs fantastic about theater, on the next night, the next performance date, it can be repeated and new life can be breathed into it at each repetition. It can be repotentialized. What does that mean? Each individual performance is saved in the actorâs memory as a result of the rehearsal process â all directions, all the right and wrong turns, thoughts, feelings, texts, contexts, appearances, entrances, exits â the entire fabric of scenes and dialogues. They have been inscribed within him and memorized. He can draw from them and play them again and again, and each performance lays down another memory pathway, so that his archive continually becomes fuller and richer. But only if the actor risks what has been before and frees it can he again electrify it. Only if he time and again and once more risks opening his acting to the uncertainty of his movements does a performance take off. This act of creative repetition is what makes acting so electrifying. It is its aesthetic desire, for the actors and for the audience. It opens all involved to a temporal piece of art that defies common sense, the reason of the everyday. Or perhaps it opens them to the gift of the muses that allows the dawning of an era in which the law of chronology no longer holds. The actor looks to the remembered past. He brings it into the present word for word, situation for situation and at the same time sends it into the future word for word, situation for situation by taking all that has happened and again exposing it to the openness of the present. In this way, he secures the future of his acting. There is no closure, because it is reopened in every performance. The actor may be chained to the chronology of the plot and to a certain setting, but in the kairos of time â in the present, past, and future â he can again find, recognize, develop, and remember new and ever more complex meanings in the play and its performative form. He can make good on something he maybe owes the play. He can go back to what has been in time and make up for lapses after the fact. For this reason the difference in each repeated performance is always also an act of freedom and of liberation, an act of regeneration.51 He overturns the past and present because the future acts within him â always unique, always singular. For this reason it is not the same performance that is given each evening in each show with the same name, but each 51 Arno BÃ¶hler, âNietzsche â Vom regenerativen Charakter des GemÃ¼ts,â psycho-logik 2, Existenz und GefÃ¼hl (2007)."

Second, the initial innovations in Silicon Valley focused on âsiliconâ based ideas. It was used in the production of electronic components and microcircuits. Some of the companies involved were Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory and Fairchild Semiconductor, from whom Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, among others, were spawned. These innovations were taking place in the Santa Clara Valley in San Francisco. It is these innovators who âdeveloped a culture of openly denying the hierarchical culture of traditional corporations. People remained faithful to each other, but not to the employer or the industry.â5 This is Silicon Valley. We need to recognize this, because nowhere in Africa is silicon itself being used to innovate through production. Africans are joining this innovation space during the digitalâand, more correctly, the mobileâ era. So âdigitalâ is a better description of African innovation at this time. Also, though âsavannahâ is used to depict an African landscape, it is not an African word. It comes from a Native American community for the grassland prairies they inhabited.6 Should we not be using the name that Africans themselves gave their grasslands?âNyika! This renamingââDigital Nyikaââeven though a seemingly small change, is an exercise that forces us to look at the African innovation space without biases. We can then learn from other innovative spaces around the world, copy what is necessary, build what infrastructure we need, and innovate for Africa first. Only then can uniquely African knowledge and financial investment grow in an environment that is in itself unique. Third, it should be noted that most of the tech solutions that have come out of Africa and ventured onto the international stage had a local problem at their core. That is all well and good. But the current Silicon"

In the first weeks and months after March 11, I could hardly bear to think about or look at trees, leaves, and dirt, wondering how much cesium had been absorbed into all the plants living and breathing between Tohoku and Tokyo and beyond. And although this acute sense of dread gradually faded, it was not because the cesium disappeared, but simply the lessening of a sense of crisis with the passing of time. The cesium (to mention just one contaminant) is still there, just centimeters below the surface of everyday life, its toxic half-life far from over."
329,185,0.94,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"Western companies tend to work in this fashion as well. They identify a need they want to address and then find the SDO partner that has the capability and experience to deliver that good. For the SDO, corporate support can be a tremendous boon. Oftentimes, however, the relationship between the two entities encounters difficulties. Companies and SDOs might have different approaches and necessarily have different aims. In a 1999 book Corporate-NGO Partnership in Asia-Pacific, editor Tadashi Yamamoto writes of the numerous challenges that face ongoing corporate-NGO partnerships. During our work, we have found two innovative programs that seek to address these challenges and improve the relationships between companies and SDOs. CCPHI is an Indonesian nonprofit that promotes partnerships among companies, NGOs, and local governments to encourage sustainable communities. CCPHI acts as a sort of marriage counselor to the corporate-SDO partners. Every relationship needs a third party from time to time. CCPHI acts as that third party, offering training, counseling, and tools for effective and sustainable corporateâSDO partnerships. Singapore Management University (SMU) has also developed a program to address the disconnect that often occurs between companies, SDOs, and the government. In the new Master of Tri-Sector Collaboration degree program now offered, students learn skills to traverse the barriers between these three parts of society. Center Director Martin Tan says, âAs societal issues in the world become more complex, we need to recognize that there isnât a one-size-fits-all approach to solving these issues nor will there be one single entity that will have all the answers. Not the government, businesses, or civil society on its own. However, we could if we collaborate across all sectors and leverage on each otherâs strengths and expertise to address some of society's greatest challenges collectively.â This course, now in its second year, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both SMUâs program and CCPHI offer innovative means to bring about more effective partnerships. Both recognize that the need to work together to solve complex problems, while still relatively untested in Asia, will be critical going forward. 2.

Bernlefâs Out of Mind appeared in 1988 as the ï¬rst book-length ï¬ctional account consistently told from the patientâs point of view.8 Robert Davisâs My Journey into Alzheimerâs Disease was its ï¬rst book-length Alzheimerâs patient autobiographical counterpart.9 Subsequently, in 1993, Diana Friel McGowinâs Living in the Labyrinth attracted international attention to dementia patient accounts.10 Other publications have followed, though the number of dementia patients voicing their experiences in book-length narratives still barely rises above a dozen. Similarly, the surge of Alzheimerâs disease caregiver narratives commenced only eighteen years ago, when John Bayleyâs Iris Trilogy provoked international resonance â certainly enhanced by Richard Eyreâs 2001 movie adaptation.11 That the Wellcome Trust Book Prize has been awarded to an Alzheimerâs caregiver narrative in 2009, and only two years later to a ï¬ctional story featuring the condition, signals continued sociocultural concern with the condition.12 But the encounter with the elderly lady confronted me with questions whose consideration appeared to be absent from this mainstream narrative, namely, how do patients and caregivers cope with dementia in daily life; how do they experience memory loss; and, above all, how do they negotiate with this very narrative. For this reason I began reading Alzheimerâs diseaserelated accounts, both ï¬ction and life-writing. These narratives put into perspective my research, for example, with sterile cell culture models. With each narrative I felt the tension between fact and ï¬ction increase. The questions I increasingly asked could less and less be answered by the research I was pursuing; and the ways in which patients in particular told about their"
140,26,0.94,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"One of his Ph.D. students nonetheless studied this topic in his dissertation, with the use of factor analysis! (Bond, 1988). The work on democide is probably the aspect of Rummelâs work that captures most attention now. It was also to be his last major research effort even though he continued to publish shorter articles, blog postsâand six novels, to which I return briefly later. In this brief attempt at a periodization of Rummelâs work, I have omitted a book that does not fall clearly into any of the major periods. This is his book on the nuclear arms race, discussed in this volume by Matthew Kroenig & Bardia Rahmani (Chap. 6). In Peace Endangered: Reality of DÃ©tente (1976a), Rummel critiqued dÃ©tente, expressed skepticism about arms control, and called for a policy that would give the West a clear nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union. Published at a time when liberals were hopeful about dÃ©tente and arms control, it created a signiï¬cant distance between himself and scholars who might have been receptive to his message about freedom and peace. Instead, it probably reinforced the prejudice, still common in peace research, that talking about a democratic peace just meant rehashing old enemy images of âusâ and âthemâ and familiar propaganda for âthe free worldâ. Richard Chadwick notes in an aside (Chap. 5, note 2) an estrangement between Rummel and himself. It dates to this period, though not exclusively to this issue. Intriguingly, Rummel relates (1989: 317f) that his hawkish message was not well received in the national security establishment either, which led to a cut-off of his long-term funding from DARPA."
229,48,0.94,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"Read added that âwhatsoever it claspeth with the clawes, it holdeth it firmly ... [so] that it seemeth to be nailed to the partâ.32 The grip of the crab was understood not only as painful but as immensely strong and tenacious, matching precisely the intractability and resistance to cure which was one of cancerâs most distinctive features. A renowned French practitioner Pierre Dionis made the connection explicit in 1701 when he explained that ââTis no more possible to extirpate [cancer], than force a Crab to quit what he has grasped betwixt his griping Clawsâ, while in the sixteenth century, ParÃ© deemed the link between the âtenacityâ of cancer and the âtoothed clawsâ of the crab so instructive that he inserted a picture of the creature into his writing on the subject, to drive home the âperspicuousâ nature of the comparison.33 In the figure of the crab, early modern medical practitioners effectively united the diverse visible and invisible symptoms of cancer. Moreover, this practice appears not to have problematized, or been problematized by, understandings of cancer as humoral in origin. This phenomenon is seen amplified in Chapter 3 of this book, where I discuss the casting of cancer as a type of worm or wolf. Although medical practitioners had a good sense of cancerâs symptomatology, however, there remained an element of doubt in any diagnosis. As Witherâs verse suggested, in order to really be sure that a patient was suffering from cancer, one had to see whether the suspect tumour followed the most distinctive cancerous âbehaviourâ, that of expanding and spreading throughout the body. Malignancy was, as I shall discuss, fundamental to the very meaning of this disease, setting âtrueâ cancers apart from the myriad of less dangerous ulcers and neoplasms. Furthermore, it presented a counterpoint to all medical writersâ diagnostic criteria. The way to âknowâ a cancer was to see it growing; however, that hardly required medical expertise, and once a cancer had grown large, it was much more difficult to treat. Diagnosis therefore presented the first of this diseaseâs many challenges to medical wisdom. Encounters with suspect tumours were not only matters of clinical determination, but of defining human relationships to cancer."

315,359,0.94,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"The structure of this discourse shows that this young person has a strong sense of self; he tries to judge objectively the disadvantages that certain national identities could entail but does not adopt a conflictive attitude or present himself as a victim. Indeed, quite the opposite is true; he expects to be valued for his qualities and success. The identity problem this points to does not entail integration difficulties for wanting to hold on to his origins, but centers on the demands which the Moroccan student places on himself to prove his worth as a Spanish citizen, despite any discrimination he might suffer from natives. The second type of discourse is totally different. It is manifested in youth in early adulthood who say that they like to mix with others of their own national origin outside work. Outside work is very important here. In other words, they think about their national identity and identify with it when relaxing or going out socially. However, in less exclusive areas, such as the workplace or standard circulation in public spaces, self-awareness of their foreignness is not a driving force. This is illustrated by the case of an Ecuadorian who had started working at a young age with his father in the familyâs butchery business and says he only mixes socially with Ecuadorians. However, at the same time, this youth is trying to attain his secondary-school certificate (ESO) and is aiming to enlist in the Spanish armed forces. As his goal shows, he is far from being against a Spanish identity. In general, we can observe that the nationalistic self-projection of the second generation in leisure contexts but not in other aspects of their lives occurs particularly among youths who set themselves nationalistically neutral goals in the labor market concerning their future as adults, while enjoying an easy circle of friends of similar national origin. This certainly presents a way of holding on to a sense of national identity that does not hinder progress in terms of social integration."

125,156,0.94,"Charismatic Christianity in Finland, Norway, and Sweden : Case Studies in Historical and Contemporary Developments","Paulaâs impression was that of an increased openness for people to share Words of Knowledge, which she reports as especially frequent with one congregant. Previously, the senior pastor was in charge of the service, and acted as mediator of the messages given. Today, Words of Knowledge are enacted by ordinary congregants, who are allowed to proclaim them at the discretion of the pastors. We may appreciate that Paula does not refer to current pastors as being involved in giving Words of Knowledge, although they maintain control of their enactment. This was also congruent with my observations at Sunday services, where one congregant came forward during a post-service intercession meeting and shared a Word of Knowledge through the microphone. I asked Paula whether practicing gifts of grace is now more evenly spread throughout the congregation. âYes,â she responded, â[but] during the services, not a lot of people are given the chance [to practice] gifts of grace at the moment.â Paula also expressed regret that gifts of grace were not used more frequently at the church, but also added that they are practiced in small groups, which constitute âplaces for training and trying out the gifts of grace in safe environments. Itâs not easy,â she said, explaining that the gifts are related to each individualâs walk with God and the processes of maturing oneâs personal faith. Walking up to stand in front of several hundred people, proclaiming to have a message from God, can be a terrifying affair. âIt is something that requires trust. You need to have the nerve for it and have a yearning for it,â Paula elaborated. From her description, we understand that enacting gifts of grace puts a person in a vulnerable position. The need for training becomes clearer if we understand the element of self-doubt involved, an example for which we will find in one of Matthewâs experiences. Matthew was reminded of Words of Knowledge when discussing prophecy. The former is a gift thought to bring mental and bodily challenges to light, âthat somebody is struggling with [certain] thoughts,â and physical ills, such as âsomebody having a painful shoulder.â Matthew stated that God can provide comfort through Words of Knowledge which, he said, âhappens sometimesâ at the Credo Church.

Also Kostaâs notation can be written in a line; this is an advantage in text, but possibly a hindrance for writing out pictures of complex derivations. On the other hand my notation has the advantage that it allows one to write several hypotheses, whereas Kostaâs arrow notation allows just one source for the arrow; for my application in (7) above, that would have been a fatal flaw. As all this illustrates, there are some quite subtle relationships between notation and concept, and they are very sensitive to the purpose that the notation will be put to, and the mathematical context in which it will be used. But elsewhere Kosta forgets the variables. For example he asks [4, Â§5]: Can inferences be reduced to consequence relations? So that having an inference from A to B means just that B is a consequence of A. where should the variables go? I suggest that the concept of an inference needs three variables, essentially as in Kostaâs notation (9) for derivations: x is an inference from y to z."

No matter how long an actor practices his art, no matter how much ability he acquires over time, no matter how well he masters the craft, he will never lose his own shadow. Whether or not his acting is felicitous will always be up in the air. The eventfulness of playing in the theater necessarily leads the actor to oscillate between power and impotence,10 between activity and passivity, between being perpetrator and victim. In-between. These contradictions are inadequately, paradoxically bound to one another. Promising and ominous."

Battersea, the court heard, was one of the poorest suburbs of London, and in Henley Street, where the Joneses lived, slum-dwellers were âhuddled together like sheepâ.1 The Coroner tried to clarify the objects of the hospital that was treating so many poor South Londoners: âI see in your hospitalâs annual report the words, âNo experiments on patientsâ. What do they mean?â he asked da Costa, who replied: âI donât know. I donât suppose any hospital has experiments on patients. We perform every kind of operationâ. The hospitalâs secretary (chief administrator), G.W.F. Robbins, explained that it meant no interventions for the sake of knowledge rather than the benefit of patients. To the Coronerâs suggestion that this implied other hospitals did experiment, Robbins answered âNot in the leastâ.2 It seemed, however, that local people thought otherwise: one of the medical men present had heard that some people were afraid to go into hospital in case they were experimented on. The accounts of âhuman vivisectionâ that sometimes appeared in British newspapers referred to therapeutic experiments in European hospitals rather than patients being dissected alive in Britain, but they probably stoked fears that Londonâs medical men did not willingly confine their researches to animals.3 The Anti-Vivisection Hospital, by requiring its staff to sign a personal pledge not to experiment on animals or humans, was deliberately presenting itself as a safer alternative to Bartâs and other London teaching hospitals where vivisectionists worked. Thanks to the indefatigable Stephen Coleridge, everybody thought they knew where Londonâs vivisectionists were. In 1901, he had published a list, The Metropolitan Hospitals and Vivisection, with a âbloodred bandâ of âfearsome appearanceâ against the names of the offending hospitals and schools. This caused serious concern to Londonâs teaching hospitals, which feared that the âstream of charityâ might be diverted away from them if donors thought they were paying for vivisection, and there ensued a convoluted public argument over how much, if any, charitable giving actually found its way into the laboratories of vivisectionists. To add insult to financial injury, Coleridge used the familiar anti-vivisection argument from the nineteenth centuryâthat vivisectionists were, or became, callous and were thus unfit to attend"

An easy way to help them resist this temptation is to have shoppers ask for receipts. But how do you get shoppers to do that? By giving them a reward, or at least the prospect of a reward. To take advantage of this disciplinary effect, we introduced a lottery on receipts for cash transactions. Every week, dozens of winners of cash prizes would be drawn, and the results would be widely publicized. The effect was signiï¬cant. Reported revenue went up every month. After nine months, the increase started to level off, but reported revenue remained high. Originally, the plan was to introduce a similar kind of lottery for credit card payments to cover an even bigger part of the economy and stimulate wider usage of credit cards, which would have helped decrease the size of the cash-based shadow economy. This second stage, however, was never implemented, although preliminary research showed that it would probably have been successful. 5.4.3"

As obvious as it may seem at first glance, this disadvantage accumulation is a key point of the framework: ICTâs effect is non-assured; it could be null, positive or even some combinations of assets, i.e. of low access and poor usage; and it may have negative effects on several aspects of wellbeing.

But due to this discovery, Cantor (apparently an impassive researcher) suddenly becomes a craving subject, driven by the desire to establish priority and secure the prize (p. 61). In terms of university discourse: the confrontation with arginineâs role in tumorigenesis (a in the upper-right position), destabilises the expert (S2 in the upper-left position) and produces various symptoms of desire ($ in the lower-right position) in a seemingly impassive university professor. For Stafford, Cantor is a lab creature (S2), but it soon turns out that he is not a single-minded researcher who lives solely for his work. He has a second, secret life (and an affluent one at that, because of a calculated marriage). Outside the lab, he lives the life of a gentleman-connoisseur, interested in erotic art, classical music and Jugendstil furniture, playing Boccherini in a string quartet and obsessed with SchÃ¶nberg, Hindemith and Egon Schiele. In this role, he encounters Paula Curry, a tall, athletic, cello-playing Valkyrie who happens to be Celestineâs aunt. Clouds begin to appear in the clear blue sky when Cantor receives a call from his competitor Kurt Krauss (professor at Harvard) informing him that, although he had put his best post-doc (Yuzo Ohashi, âmy Staffordâ) to work on it, the latter had been unable to replicate Jerryâs experiment. Cantor decides that Jerry and he should replicate the experiment together, and apparently this time they are successful, until Cantor receives an anonymous note, an unsigned message, one sentence long, suggesting that Jerry secretly doctored the results: Why was Dr. Stafford in your private laboratory Sunday evening? (p. 93). This of course raises Cantorâs suspicion. Why had Jerry secretly visited the lab? Cantor faces a dilemma. Should he retract the paper, exposing himself to academic humiliation, so that from now on every colleague will associate his name with fraud, or at least with sloppiness and irreproducibility? Cantor had never withdrawn a published paper before, had never reported unduplicatable experiments. An error of this magnitude would never be forgotten. Cantor decides to perform a second experiment, using a somewhat different design, an alternative route to the top. With the Prize before him and the spectre of withdrawal peering over his shoulder, he disappears into his private lab for weeks, unavailable to the outside world. In the end, all seems to end well. Both versions of the experiment are eventually confirmed, and both Cantor and Stafford fly to Stockholm to collect the Nobel Prize, but this does not put an end to the questionability of their results and the situation remains uncomfortable. The dialectical structure of the narrative can be summarised as follows. The first moment (M1) is an unexpected idea which allows Cantor to link abstract biochemistry with something relevant and concrete, namely cancer research. But this idea has to be realised in an experimental fashion (M2), and this proves a frustrating experience, because the researchers are confronted with a hurdle, with the replication complex as it were. The goal is to overcome this hurdle, to discover the decisive experimental move, so that the abstract idea can be sublated into textbook knowledge (M3), but on the final page of the novel it is still unclear whether this has really been achieved.

Some GPs were aware of the need to support families, but others thought it best to advise them that providing care âcan only have an adverse effect on their own lives, without beneï¬ting the patientâs in the slightestâ, and because âno additional help can be sufï¬cient to make it bearableâ, admission to long-stay care was preferable (Gibson 1957, p. 111). Conveniently for GPs, this ï¬tted with psychiatristsâ views that their hospitals had an obligation to fulï¬l GPsâ requests âto admit the elderly dementing type of patients from the catchment areaâ.19 Psychiatrists genuinely tried to help older people by admitting them when they had nowhere else to go and no one to help them with the essentials of daily life,20 but neither GPs nor psychiatrists were keen to actively work with them (Watts and Watts 1952, p. 140). Tensions existed between GPs and the psychiatric hospitals, as David Enoch, a consultant psychiatrist at Shelton Hospital, Shrewsbury, described in the early 1960s: GPs used to ring us up and say: âAn old bird is on the way to you.â Sometimes we were lucky if we even had a message at all! When we went round in the week we were told that there were three people over 80 that had been âpushed in.â The matron and the chief male nurse just had to ï¬nd a bed. These patients merely appeared. I have great respect for the local authority and those trying to deal with the chronic sick â but Shelton was the âdumping groundâ for this county. I think the hospital deserves a medal.21"
252,50,0.94,The Ethics of Vaccination,"tured, loose collections of individuals, rather than the responsibilities of organized, structured groups that can be assimilated to individual agents (List and Pettit 2011). Also, in principle and in an ideal world, the collective in question would have to include the entire global population, because local failures to realize herd immunity could endanger the life or health of the vulnerable people living in a certain area. Therefore, ideally, the type of collective obligation we are looking for would have to be what Bill Wringe called a âglobal obligationâ (Wringe 2014). However, in many areas of the world, and in developing countries especially, access to vaccines can be both very difficult and very expensive. It seems unreasonable to expect that people in poor countries who do not have access to vaccines have a collective moral obligation to contribute to the realization of herd immunity. I will proceed under the assumption that the collective obligation to realize herd immunity, although in principle a âglobal obligationâ, given the situation of our world, currently only applies to the group of people with easy access to vaccines. Now, if it is true that the obligation to realize herd immunity cannot be individual, it also seems problematic to argue that there exists a collective to which such responsibilities can be attributed. Some authors, for example Peter French (1984), have argued that only collectives with a formal decision structure can be the subjects of collective obligations. These types of groups constitute collective entities that, because of their internal structure and decision procedures, count as particular types of agents and therefore might bear a form of responsibility (as some have argued, including Pettit 2007, and List and Pettit 2011). However, people who together have the causal power to realize herd immunity constitute simply a random collection of individuals. There is no structured and formal connection or coordination among individuals that render them a collective agent. And to the extent that we think that only agents, that is, individuals that can intentionally act, can have the responsibility to act in certain ways, the collective that could realize herd immunity cannot have the moral responsibility to realize herd immunity, at least not in the same sense as agents like a state or a corporation have the responsibility to bring about or prevent certain outcomes. Attribution of collective responsibility to unstructured groups might reflect some form of metaphorical talking, but it is difficult to see how collective responsibility can literally be attributed to such groups. However, according to some, it is not necessary that a group has a structure and an internal organization in order to be considered an agent and therefore a subject of collective obligations. As Sean Aas has suggested,"
308,105,0.94,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"The Objectives of the Religious Law (The Shariâah) The Value of Man Islam differs from many other religions in providing a complete code of life. It encompasses the secular with the spiritual, the mundane with the celestial. Man is the vicegerent of God on earth âBehold thy Lord said to the Angels: I will create a vicegerent (khalifa) on earthâ (Q. 2:30). He endowed Adam with knowledge of all things, as the Qurâan relates: âAnd He taught Adam the names-all of themâ (Q. 2:31). The Angels had no knowledge of those things. Accordingly, Adam was on a higher level than the angels. It was for this reason that God commanded the angels to bow in obeisance for Adam: We said to the Angels prostrate before Adam; so they prostrated except for Iblies (Satan, the Devil) who is from the Jinn. âHe refused and was arrogant and became a disbelieverâ (2:34). Allah said: What prevented you from prostrating (to Adam) when I commanded you? (Iblies) said: âI am better than him. You created me from ï¬re and created him from clayâ (Q. 17:12). The satanic claim to superiority is the source of arrogance. Islam considers it the worst sin since through arrogance all other sins are committed. Adam and his progeny were honored by God, as the Qurâan says: âWe honored the progeny of Adam â¦ and preferred them over many of what We have created with (deï¬nite) preferenceâ (Q. 12:70). According to the Qurâan there is no original sin. Adam repented from his mistake of eating from the fruit of the forbidden tree, by the deceit and trick of Satan. (Q. 7:19â23). Adam and Eve both repented and God accepted their repentance, and were forgiven. The Qurâan has recorded what Adam and Eve said to God: Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves; and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will be surely among the losers (Q. 7:23)."

300,198,0.94,"White-Collar Crime in The Shadow Economy : Lack of Detection, investigation and Conviction Compared To Social Security Fraud","Not many news media outside of the larger ones will be able to allocate journalists to work on an investigative white-collar crime for months. In the cases where they have done this, editors seems to be uncertain as to whether this allocation of resources was worthwhile relative to the size and the complexity of the case. For a common, non-specialist news media, there will always be a balance between resources and the newsworthiness of the matter at hand. If a major white-collar crime story had emerged in Norway in the weeks after the July 22 terrorist attacks in 2011, it is unlikely that the story would have attracted much attention in the general public press. The general news media have a constant incoming flow of news on hand, and there is an ongoing daily prioritization of what is important and what should be published. For all news items there are some general rules of journalism that come into play: Is the item important to many people? Is it really news? Is it possible to get reliable information on this? Is it possible to approach the right people with the right questions? Can both parties in a conflict be approached? And in addition to these questions, there will be a question as to whether the news organization at this point in time has the resources to deal with the item. If the journalist knowledgeable about economic matters is on holiday, it is doubtful whether the news media organization will come back to the item at a later date. That will depend on the development and the newsworthiness of the item at the second point in time. If the news organization is the first to report on a crime and it is regarded as âhotâ, it will probably do whatever possible to handle the matter at hand, knowing that other media, and especially online media, can report on the same matter and as such âstealâ the story. There is always internal pride in a news organization when it can report on a matter of significant interest, and be cited by other news organizations. The organizational culture also has an influence on white-collar crime detection among journalists. If you have journalists that are driven to win investigative journalism prizes (e.g., SKUP in Norway), there is a higher possibility that such stories will be published. But this will differ greatly among news organizations. ÃvrebÃ¸ (2004) showed in a study of the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen that after a change of editor-in-chief in 2001, the news profile and priorities of the newspaper changed according to the principles laid down by the new editor when she took up her position. It can be argued that an editorâs personal preferences can influence the news priorities of a newspaper, and this relates to all types of editorial material, whether it is general, sports, culture, or financial news."
223,325,0.94,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"What Is Semantic Knowledge? What is it that you know when you know a language? Certainly, you know many words of the language (its lexicon), and you know how to put the words together in an appropriate way (the syntax). More important, you know the meaning of the words (the semantics of the language). If you do not master the meaning of the words you are using, there is no point in knowing the syntax (unless you are a parrot). You can communicate in a foreign language with some success just by knowing some words and without using any grammar. In this sense semantic knowledge precedes syntactic knowledge. This chapter focuses on an aspect of semantic knowledge that has not been well studied, its organization into domains. Children learn a language without effort and completely voluntarily. They learn new words miraculously fast. Teenagers master about 60,000 words of their mother tongue by the time they finish high school. In their speech and writing they may not actively use more than a subset of the words, but they understand all of them. A simple calculation reveals that they have learned an average of 9â10 words per day during childhood. A single example of how a word is used is often sufficient for learning its meaning. No other form of learning is so obvious or so efficient. Nevertheless, the semantic learning mechanisms show some strong asymmetries. For instance, why is it easier to explain to a 4-year-old the meaning of the color terms chartreuse and mauve than to explain monetary terms like inflation or mortgage? The difference is not a matter of word frequency: The monetary terms are more frequent, but the 4-year-old masters the semantic domain of colors and thereby knows the meaning of many color words. Adding new color terms is just a matter of learning the mapping between the new words and the color space."

Here is important to notice that even a content presented to the user is personalized it is still suitable only for a human. One has to make sometimes not a small effort to make this information useful. This is significant especially when the user is looking for information. After constructing a query what can be sometimes time consuming and for not computer-literate people very complicated action, the user gets a list, which is assembled only after a text processing (a fulltext comparison between query and data stored in databases). For instance, if user's keywords are job and programmer because we want to find a job position for a programmer, the result is all documents containing these words. These documents do not even have to be job offers. It might be documents describing programmer's job in generally. Here is no guarantee that this list contains links to documents the user has been looking for and the user has to browse them to extract information. This result also does not take into account relations among information that are for a human obvious at a first sight. A solution to this problem is to represent the Web content not only in a form understandable for a human but also in a form that is easily machine-understandable. In (Antoniou & van Haremelen, 2004) is the term machine-understandable consider as not very appropriate even it is used quite often. This term makes people think that computers can really understand. Authors incline rather to use the term machineprocessable instead. Here comes Tim Berners-Lee's vision called Semantic Web initiative. This initiative tries to add semantics to knowledge to make it processable by automated tools as well as by people. Probably the easiest way how to capture the meaning of the presented content provides metadata (data about data), which can be added to the presented content.

David Wei of Shanghai built hospitals for Tibetan medicine in Tibet and Shanghai after witnessing the poor health-care infrastructure in Tibet. Laurel and George Tahija established a foundation focused on cultivating all childrenâs learning potential in Indonesia, after finding these resources lacking when raising their own children. There is also a strong paternalistic urge among Asians who have amassed wealth. It is not uncommon to hear those with wealth âhelping the peopleâ or âproviding for the poor.â There is a cultural affinity with taking care of those less fortunate in very much a paternalistic manner. Those receiving this assistance also buy into the notion of being taken care of. In his book Blood and Silk, writer Michael Vatikiotis quotes Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathirâs daughter Marina Mahathir: âWe are accustomed to tolerating the extraordinary wealth of our leaders. That is because we consider they deserve riches in return for looking out for us.â5 While this quote is referring to political leaders, it is also very much the case when it comes to business leaders. Communities expect those with wealth to provide for them. Those with wealth historically and still much in practice today feel it is their role to be the patriarch and take care of their extended family, relatives or not. The cultivation and strengthening of relationships is another reason to give. People give when a friend or business associate asks for support of a cause or an organization that they have also been supporting. We will discuss this motivation in detail in the next section. For many in business, a business imperative is reason to give. Many seek training and increased educational opportunities to raise the quality of employees. Others augment existing educational systems with their own training programs and courses. And lastly, there is face, always a motivation in Asia. A philanthropist chooses to give so as to receive recognition for largesse. Of course, discerning cause and effect is a chicken-and-egg phenomenon. Does one give in order to get recognition or is recognition the reasonable and justifiable response to a generous act? In any case, the social imperative for giving is growing in Asia. While some wealthy people resist the trend, most acknowledge the trend itself, one that affects not only the wealthy but also the middle class. Later on in this book, we will talk about the rise of crowdfunding throughout the region and its support among those with average incomes. Here we will address several key strategies employed by well-off philanthropists."

261,78,0.939,The Poetics and Politics of Alzheimerâs Disease Life-Writing,"Konek carries the titleâs antithetic message on a narrative level, when portraying the disruptive power of Alzheimerâs disease by connecting different storylines, whose alternations do not follow a systematic pattern. The story of her growing up and being shaped by the confrontation with her father is interwoven with the story of her parentâs progressing condition, as well as Konekâs present-day dreams, her childhood thoughts and sections on the fear of losing her own self-awareness. Nevertheless, these storylines follow their individual timelines, suggesting that the narrator surrenders to her urgent need to maintain a sense of continuity that counterbalances her sense of biographical disruption.21 This disruption is carried forward, as the patientâs active presence decreases throughout the text, its second half reporting about him only from the distance of the third person, which mirrors involution and anticipates his death. As Konek strings together snippets of past and present, her narrative resembles a series of photographs, each no longer than half a page told in the present tense. The fatherâs âgift to his family is historyâ (13), as he recorded memories through photography, a form which creates continuity, since Konek takes on the fatherâs memory-making role. Just as the camera shoots one-moment-in-time images, she perceives of Alzheimerâs disease itself as a condition that leaves room for no more than the current moment, when describing her fatherâs attention, for example, as a âï¬icker of knowingâ (137). In this context, it is worth noting that Linda Grantâs Remind Me Who I Am, Again similarly has the purpose of maintaining the motherâs memory, as it describes her dementia which is caused by transient ischemic attacks, while recording the familyâs past, also in assembling photographs.22 In comparison to Ernaux, Konek continues to perceive of her ill parent as teacher, claiming that â[w]hen he had given all he could give consciously, he still gave us an example of endurance, of suffering, of awful mortalityâ (161). The very notion of continuity and closure reaches full circle, when, in her concluding lines, the daughter completely identiï¬es herself with the father: âI adored him. I worshiped him. I respected him. I judged him. I hated him."
118,670,0.939,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"due to this, most information shown to nuclear engineers from social-aspects experts was not deep enough to motivate nuclear engineers to think about it. Of course, the problems did not exist only among social-aspects experts but also among nuclear engineers. They did not have an attitude of sincerely listening to and collaborating with social-aspects experts. As seen in the previous sections, nuclear engineers became aware of the importance of social aspects. However, it was mostly done in a passive and reluctant manner, and they did not really understand how social aspects are related to nuclear technology. Then, engineers left most things about society up to social-aspects experts so that they can be free from mutual communication with society. In summary, I observe two types of miscommunication between nuclear-technology experts and social-aspects experts, rather than between social-aspects experts and citizens: (1) a quantitative one, which is due to insufficient communication between nuclear-technology experts and social-aspects experts, and (2) a qualitative one, which is due to the fact that most information provided from social-aspects experts to nuclear engineers was not deep enough to stimulate nuclear engineers. Consequently, it may even be said that the mutual communication between citizens and nuclear engineers was further reduced and the distance between society and nuclear technology could not be decreased in the last decade, although frameworks to conduct mutual communication was nominally established and deployed (Fig. 20.2)."

An individual, the entrepreneur, learns programming in college and then decides to use his new skills by writing an app for his iPhoneâwriting it both for the pleasure and interest of doing so, and also because he has a particular way he likes to plan and record his vacations. His app, âMyTravel,â allows him to record an itinerary, include photos and commentary, and export to his personal blog. Naturally by doing good development work, his friends are impressed, want their own copy, and later ask him to add additional features. By word of mouth the popularity of the app increases until the group of friends decides to form a small company to further enhance and market the product. Sometime later as success grows, the need for venture capital appears and the âno stinkinâ architectureâ dialog ensues. But why would the inventor be so resistant to talking about architecture? Simply because of how his company evolved. At the outset of his efforts, he was just âmessing aroundâ and the project just accreted features in a haphazard fashion after that. He was just working for himself, with no intention of ever forming a company. He never took the time to focus on âarchitecture.â There is a deep falsehood in this narrative, however. Unless the developer was truly ignorant, he will have used Appleâs app developer tools, such as Cocoa, the XCode software development kit, the Quartz framework, and user interface guidelines.

Their English was very poor and they had no advocacy interpreters. She noted that âyou wouldnât really know at all what was going on with themâ.111 Mental and physical diseases were often exacerbated by addiction to alcohol and drugs. Heroin addiction became a âdevastatingâ problem in the East End of London during the 1980s.112 Compliance with medication regimes also differed between groups. Bangladeshis were in general very compliant with prescriptions and medication, whereas Afro-Caribbean patients were less keen on taking medicines or relying on traditional western medicine.113 Psychosomatic presentations were common in both men and women from different ethnic backgrounds; however, Sarah Hall maintained that for women there would âbe a much more rapid shift into a psychiatric domainâ.114 Both GPs with experience treating immigrant communities were of the opinion that patients who somatised were not able to express distress beyond bodily pain. Robertson maintained that if one were to ask any east London GP, they would tell you how difficult it was to manage psychological symptoms in immigrant groups because of what he described as the âI hurt all overâ syndrome.115 As Hashmi had noted in his paper in 1970, presentations were often culturally specific. Hall suggested, for example, that a psychological diagnosis would be seen as threatening in Bengali culture because it would suggest weakness: If the psychological domain meant you were weak, that you might have a family weakness . . . that might be very troublesome when your daughters or sons came to get married, an alliance, you know. So any hint of weakness was really quite difficult.116 Hall explained that, while wishing to avoid generalisations about all Bengalis, most often, as patients, their favoured discourse was in the physical domain, articulated through some kind of pain â usually gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal. Often a patient would present with a long list of different pains and would be reluctant to accept a psychological diagnosis due to the stigma attached to it. According to Hall, for example, the Bengalis did not have a word for âdepressionâ in their culture.117 Often, patients would be uncomfortable with the language and the concepts of western medicine. Eventually, Hall realised that it was mostly counter-productive to apply western concepts and illustrated"

Realising that his crimes have been rumbled, Bernie hires a mobster to kill the two young men at a party he will host at his exclusive Long Island beach-house. However, instead the mobster has Bernie killed for having an affair with his wife. Excited about their weekend of partying at Bernieâs house, Larry and Richard arrive to find Bernie dead in his chair. Thus begins a black comedic narrative in which Bernieâs corpse retains its liveliness in many biological and social ways. Fearing that they will be suspected of Bernieâs murder, Larry and Richard delay informing the police. As Bernieâs house starts to fill up with partygoers they see that nobody realises that their quiet host, sitting on the couch in a pair of sunglasses, is actually dead. Rather, Bernieâs friends greet and kiss him, massage him, haggle with him, and treat him as a living person. Larry and Richard therefore decide to âpostponeâ Bernieâs death so that they might have a fun weekend. They respond to Bernieâs social liveliness by acting as his guardian, explaining to the others that he is drunk. Without ever being noticed, they carry him, move his limbs about, and speak for him when the need arises. It is quite remarkable how many social interactions the corpse has in the movie. Over the course of the weekend Bernie smokes, waves, and goes waterskiing; he is âmurderedâ a further two times by the mobster assassin (who comes to question his own sanity when Bernie wonât die); and even has sex with his mistress who visits the beach-house to find out why he had not been in touch. This prompts the immortal line: âThis guy gets laid more dead than I do alive!â. Even more remarkable is the fact that, despite the sweltering weather on Long Island, Bernieâs body does not decompose nor show any signs of rigor mortis. Weekend at Bernieâs demonstrates how forms of life and liveliness can continue beyond biological death if the person is still a part of social life. In this fantasy of death denial, the âwhenâ of Bernieâs death is not recognised by his friends and is pushed into a distant temporal horizon by the two young men so that they can enjoy themselves in his company. In an even more macabre turn of events, Bernieâs corpse is reanimatedâreally this timeâthrough voodoo magic in the sequel, Weekend at Bernieâs II (1993). In other words, corpses have power and social lives through their own actions/reactions and the actions/reactions or assumptions of living people."

Until now, society has treated AI by and large as one field that encompasses many programs, ranging from IBMâs Deep Blue to airplane autopilots and surgical robots. From here on, AI should be divided into two categories. The first category would consist of operational AI programsâthe computerized âbrainsâ that guide smart instruments. The second category would be composed of oversight AI programs that verify the first categoryâs claims and keep them in line with the law. These oversight programs, which we call âAI Guardians,â would include AI programs to interrogate, discover, supervise, audit, and guarantee the compliance of operational AI programs. Thoughtful people have asked for centuries, âWho will guard the guardians?â5 We have no new answer to this question, which has never been answered well. For now, the best we can hope for is that all smart instruments will be outfitted with a readily locatable off-switch to grant ultimate control to human agents over both operational and oversight AI programs."

Pitcher accepts the annihilation thesis and asks: âthe dead, if they exist at all, are so much dust. How is it possible for so much dust to be wronged?â(Pitcher 1984, p. 183). In answering his own question he distinguishes between two kinds of subject. The post-mortem subject, call him Harry, perhaps mouldering away in some grave, and the ante-mortem Harry, as he was at some stage of his life before he died. According to Pitcher, while death cannot be bad for Harryâs corpse it can be bad for the ante-mortem Harry. Feinberg agrees with the Pitcher thesis and elaborates on the idea of ante-mortem harm. What follows is philosophical convergence, which brings together Feinberg and Pitcher, and that might for the sake of convenience be referred to as the FeinbergâPitcher account. According to FeinbergâPitcher it is not intelligible to talk of a subjectâs survival after physical death, nor does it make sense to talk of"

Before introducing the remaining resources, letâs look at the typing rules for assignments and control flow primitives, to illustrate how we use these variable and scheduler resources. The type-and-effect system features two assignment rules, one for non-racy assignments and one for potentially racy assignments (T-Asgn-Excl and T-Asgn-Racy, respectively, in Fig. 6). If we own a variable resource exclusively, then we can use the typing rule for non-racy assignments and we do not have to worry about leaking information through scheduling. However, if we only own a partial variable resource for a given variable, then any access to the variable could potentially introduce a race and we have to ensure information learned from scheduling is allowed to flow into the given variable. The typing rule for potentially racy assignments (T-Asgn-Racy) thus requires that we own a scheduler resource, schdÏ (âs ), that bounds the information that can be learned through scheduling, and requires that âs may flow"
139,30,0.939,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"1.2.4 Why You Must Use a Text Editor to Write Programs When Matlab interprets some code in a file, it is concerned with every character in the file, exactly as it was typed in. This makes it troublesome to write the code into a file with word processors like, e.g., Microsoft Word, since such a program will insert extra characters, invisible to us, with information on how to format the text (e.g., the font size and type). Such extra information is necessary for the text to be nicely formatted for the human eye. Matlab, however, will be much annoyed by the extra characters in the file inserted by a word processor. Therefore, it is fundamental that you write your program in a text editor where what you type on the keyboard is exactly the characters that appear in the file and that Matlab will later read. There are many text editors around. Some are stand-alone programs like Emacs, Vim, Gedit, Notepad++, and TextWrangler. Many prefer to use the text editor that comes with the graphical Matlab environment."
113,345,0.939,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"As the sermon continued, I found myself remembering what I had learned of traditional Fore and Gimi cosmology from reading ethnographies of the region: how human life force (auma or auna) had to be recycled into the forest to regenerate plants, animals, and people through song, weeping, and proper disposal of the corpse (Gillison 1993; West 2005; Whitfield 2008). The anthropologists who had documented these beliefs emphasized that the period immediately after a death was a dangerous time, when the personâs homeless, wandering souls could lash out in anger and harm the living. If a person was not properly mourned, its life force would âcling to the body or hamlet foreverâ (West 2005: 636), causing sickness and death in the living. The Bible verses attested to a different view of death: the body was now an âevil thing of the earth,â its loss a cause for rejoicing, not weeping. But if anything of traditional cosmology had survived Christian conversion, it was the danger associated with the liminal time before burial, and the atmosphere of blame and anger surrounding death. Teachersâ fears about exposing students to village conflicts meant that they would only work with particular types of rural peopleâthose who were pastors, who lived in nuclear family households, and who lived inside the mission compound. It seemed ironic to me: the people who benefited from the labor and teachings of the nursing students were those who already lived in relatively safe circumstances and who had the advantages that came with being inside the mission fence. The hamlet was âtoo dangerous,â its people too overwhelmed by anger and grief, too bound to pasin; the families inside the mission fence would be better equipped to daunim bel (suppress their anger) and cooperate with us. While the leaderâs death created a particularly tense atmosphere, the idea that the hauslain was an intrinsically risky place because âthe pasin is strongâ was not unique to this occasion. I had accompanied the first year class a few weeks previously on their rural experience in a different district, and students had been vigilant about not transgressing local customs. Female students had kept a particularly close eye on their clothing, food scraps, and sugarcane skins, emphasizing that all of these could be"

Not now Iâve acquired a future. But thatâs how it is. In the worst way. All the things we â we grew up not believing in. Total obsession, night and day. When I see you, you look alive and everything else â fades. All thatâ (506). His avowal of love acknowledges that all such declarations must always be citations but also that in his quotation he has, as Umberto Eco puts it, âsucceeded, once again, in speaking of loveâ (Eco, 1984: 32â3). In the dialogue of mutual possession so integral to the novelâs representation of reading and loving it is the imagination that holds in tension theoretical knowingness and the desire that subverts it. The ways in which love can be spoken becomes more interesting than the ways in which it cannot. Ventriloquising Ash and LaMotte enables Roland and Maud to relinquish some of their self-possession in order to take possession of the other, and be possessed in turn. This is represented by the scene in which they make love. It is figured as both possession and dispossession, and the language Byatt uses signifies death as well as life. Or, more specifically, a life that inheres in death: in the morning, the whole world had a strange new smell. It was the smell of the aftermath, a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples. It was the smell of death and destruction and it smelled fresh and lively and hopeful. (507) Byattâs use of sex as a vehicle for characterising Roland and Maudâs mutual possession captures the paradox of life coexisting with death, of self-possession cohabiting with dispossession. In this novel, love destroys autonomy and self-possession, and yet it is also somehow necessary to the individual, and much desired. Or, as Belsey writes, âdesire is inevitable (ânecessityâ) Christabel calls it, twice â¦ and at the same time dangerous â beyond the pleasure principle, destructive, angry, âa wrecker,â as Maud puts itâ (Belsey, 1994b: 696). Love, in this romance, embodies the paradox of âpossessionâ itself; it involves possessing the beloved, but at the same time, being possessed, possession and dispossession. Bronfen, too, observes that in the novel âto take possession in love need not always mean that the beloved is reduced to an object of possessionâ (Bronfen, 1996: 132). This is the lesson that Roland and Maud must learn. They must rethink, or, more precisely, re-feel the theoretical position they have"

We know this is not possible, even though there are many instances of representations of the Natural Numbers in perishable material media. Part of the reason for the more enduring nature of symbolic entities like the Natural Numbers is the very fact that they do not refer directly to speciï¬c objects in the physical or cultural world.

299,52,0.939,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Social science suffers from a surfeit of technical terms; I hence am reluctant to add one more. However, the current use of language is deceptive. By referring to both kinds of motivations and senses as âsatisfaction,â the difference between the two disappears, and the wording, in effect, affirms the hedonistic reductionist assumption that all acts that seem moral are actually self-serving and motivated by the pursuit of pleasure. Even if one wishes to argue that there is no profound difference between the two kinds of actsâdenoting the two kinds of motivations and acts under comparison is necessary before collapsing them. Referring to acts that are motivated by a sense that one should live up to oneâs moral commitments as âaffirmationâ rather than as âsatisfactionâ enables this discussion. (A similar attempt is made when people discuss pure or authentic altruism [see May 2011] in contrast to inauthentic âaltruisticâ behavior motivated by self-interest [see Feigin et al. 2014]). The term âobligationâ should be avoided in this context, because obligations are externally-imposed commitments, while those that drive moral behavior are internally-derived; they are what the person holds he ought to do. Finally, one might be inclined to refer to this behavior as virtuous (see Schwartz 2010); however, to reiterate, the fact that someone is driven by what he considers his moral commitment does not mean that these acts are moral. A jihadist who labors to kill as many infidels one afternoon as he can may feel that he is engaging in moral behavior. The term âvirtuousâ should be reserved for those acts that serve incontestable values, those whose moral standing is self-evident (see Etzioni 1998, 2006). For this chapter, I do not draw a distinction between the quest for affirmation as a source of motivation (âpushâ), and the sense of accomplishment (âpullâ)."
139,19,0.939,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"Note that, quite often, the terms script and scripting are used as synonyms for program and programming, respectively. The inventor of the Perl programming language, Larry Wall, tried to explain the difference between script and program in a humorous way (from perl.com1 ): Suppose you went back to Ada Lovelace2 and asked her the difference between a script and a program. Sheâd probably look at you funny, then say something like: Well, a script is what you give the actors, but a program is what you give the audience. That Ada was one sharp lady . . . Since her time, we seem to have gotten a bit more confused about what we mean when we say scripting. It confuses even me, and Iâm supposed to be one of the experts. There are many other widely used computer science terms to pick up. Writing a program (or script or code) is often expressed as implementing the program. Executing a program means running the program. An algorithm is a recipe for how to construct a program. A bug is an error in a program, and the art of tracking down and removing bugs is called debugging (see, e.g., Wikipedia3 ). Simulating or simulation refers to using a program to mimic processes in the real world, often through solving differential equations that govern the physics of the processes."
201,159,0.939,The Pathologisation of Homosexuality in Fascist Italy,"G.âs piece of writing is a photograph, precious because unique, of a non-conforming manâs life during the fascist regime. His rancorous underlying tones are probably representative of the way many homosexuals must have felt at the time: forced to be silent, closeted, invisible, angry because of the discrimination they had to suffer every day, resentful, painfully aware of the consequences of declaring their sexuality, bombarded and surrounded by hostile messages. However, several aspects of the protagonistâs life-style remain very vaguely defined: although G. admitted he had had same-sex relationships when he was young and in a men-only environment, which he could not have avoided admitting since it was on his records, he was very skilled at leaving most things unsaid. The woman he lived with turned out to be his landlady and then, to dissipate further doubts, he said he was going to marry her, which seems highly improbable as there is no mention of her in any of his letters, his Collegno and Racconigi files do not contain any correspondence from or to her. One is induced to think that she was, willingly or not, used as a cover-up. There is no statement that suggests that G. had other same-sex relationships or that he frequented other homosexuals. There is also no mention of friends, acquaintances, former colleagues and the hospital files do not hold any correspondence to and from them. If G. had any, he was very careful to keep them a secret. He reconstructed his biography, but deliberately gave no hints about his present circumstances. It is impossible to assess how internment affected G.âs professional and personal life. It seems very unlikely that he could have worked as a lawyer afterwards, particularly because internment remained on record. The Lawyersâ Associations of Milan and Turin have not replied to requests to know if he was in their list of professionals after 1931. The stigma of being a homosexual is likely to have continued to be an obstacle to his career and achievements. While nothing is known about how internment impacted on his future, G.âs memoriale is an important testimony on the social and economic consequences of homosexuality that he had already experienced: rejection from the family, professional and social marginalisation, consequent lack of income. It is possible to note that there is no mention of any visits, correspondence or benevolent gesture on the part of G.âs other siblings, two sisters and a brother: with their absence and silence, they seem to have sided with his older brother."

For Bulgarian men their sense of self is located in their Bulgarian past, while for Albanian men migration often stems from a desire to wipe out the past and to rebuild their lives from scratch. In this sense, proving their worth on the construction site is a crucial component of their embodied and masculine sense of self. The most interesting aspect of the Bulgarian menâs life stories, however, concerns the crucial role of gender relations in their personal lives. These narratives confirm the deep changes brought about in the Bulgarian family during the socialist period. The oldest man, Gencho, who was brought up in a large patriarchal family near Plovdiv, explained that when his wife worked shifts at a factory, he assumed all the household chores and took care of the children, [I did] everything.

That depends on where you live, your job, your house, if you have a family. It also depends on how you will use energy. For example, next year you might put some more efï¬cient lights in your house. But in 10 years you might have an electric car, or you might telecommute, or you might have solar panels, and it might be the same house or a different house. So the uncertainties on your energy use increase. And the uncertainties on your carbon emissions get larger. For instance, you will probably still have a refrigerator. We can probably guess it will use a similar amount of energy as today (maybe you will have the same refrigerator), but maybe you (or your utility) will get the energy for that appliance from solar or wind or gas rather than coal. Those changes mean more variability in the future. Figure 10.4 shows the same data as Fig. 10.3, but now from 1850 to 2011. Now the use is harder to project into the future. If the plot stopped in 1900 or 1950, the âprojectionâ might be very different from what you would assume today. The mix of fuels would be different: a projection of petroleum use in 1970 would be very different from one made today. And you can guess in the future that it might also be very different, for any number of reasons. Figure 10.5 shows an example of a plot that does not continue to increase.

386,14,0.939,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"Institutional economists have devoted a lot of energy towards the question of why persons would choose either hierarchies or markets as coordinating mechanism of their interactions. Three important factorsâasset specificity, frequency and uncertaintiesâhave been identified in the wake of this research which had a strong predictive power on the level of transaction costs in this context and therefore would also influence organizational choices: â If the specificity of assets is high, this creates a strong mutual dependency which suggests a long-term hierarchical organization rather than short-term trade on markets. Courses in milking technology will rather be organized in an intra-firm setting than courses in presentations. â The more often a transaction takes place, the more transaction costs can be distributed. Frequent transactions may rather be organized within one unit and in a hierarchical framework, so that repeated negotiations may be avoided. â Uncertainty increases transaction costs, so that long-term hierarchies may be chosen to avoid such uncertainties. The advantages of hierarchies are that human resources can rather flexibly be reallocated, mental work can be distributed and shared more flexibly than in a pure market setting and a well-established communication system is also more easily established within a hierarchy. More than half a century later than Ronald Coase, Ostrom (1990) introduced coordination as another important mode of interaction, showing that often people chose to jointly work for a common goal by neither trading nor submitting to each other. Everyday examples for cooperation are traffic, sports or associations. If we think about the most beautiful incident of our life, it is likely that we find it in the realm of cooperation, be it a romantic encounter, an occasion with our friends or joint work. While economists love to talk about utility maximization, they tend to neglect the fact that it is unlikely that individual utility maximizations, added up, will lead to a societal optimum by itself. It is true that, as economists often emphasize, cooperation suffers from possible opportunistic behavior like the freerider phenomenon. It is often possible to exploit a team to which I become a member by contributing less than benefitting, sometimes to the point of the collapse of the system. The spirit that joint and mutual actions produce, however, is nevertheless driving many people to, again and again, enter attempts of successful cooperation Fig. 1.1. Having mentioned cooperation and hierarchies as important occasions of interaction, they have never made it into the core domain of economic analysis. It is no"
275,130,0.939,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In a first-order theory of mind, the reasoner considers that other people have beliefs, desires, etc. that influence their behaviour; e.g. they believe we are attacking from the opposite direction. In a second-order theory of mind, the reasoner allows that others are doing the same about us and other people; e.g. my co-pilot believes that the enemy believe that we are attacking from the opposite direction. In higher-order theories of mind, this nesting continues; I believe that my co-pilot believes the enemy believe that we are attacking from the opposite direction, and I believe my co-pilot believes I believe this. Such reasoning has received much attention in empirical studies of childrenâs and adultsâ reasoning, e.g. [6, 23â25] and there is considerable evidence that many adults have ToM abilities of levels 3 and 4, with some subjects succeeding in tasks requiring level 5 reasoning, yet even level 2 reasoning is beyond the reach of almost all state-of-the-art planning tools. Multi-agent systems research has contributed a deep understanding of concepts such as group knowledge, group belief, and collective intention, often informed by philosophical and psychological perspectives, e.g. [26â30]. Studies have also examined computational models of ToM, e.g. [8, 31, 32], and also the impact of different levels of awareness that an agent has about the others acting in a team task context, e.g. [33]. Although the tools used in such investigations are highly expressive â typically description logics and rich multi-modal logics, and some bespoke algebraic belief update mechanisms â they are not accompanied by efficient reasoning engines, so fall short of providing practical means for systematically operationalising complex analyses. Existing multi-agent planning tools that do take into account the beliefs, goals, intentions and capabilities of others, e.g. [34], consider a third-person view, in which a plan is constructed for a team, and each member is given their part to execute. When planning must be distributed amongst a team (including, when humans are to be in the loop), a semi-autonomous system must plan for its own actions while considering others explicitly - i.e. such reasoning demands a first-person view."

However, patient safety in hospitals hinges on a deep, shared an understanding of this principle, and in meetings with inexperienced professionals, it seems reasonable to err on the side of over-communication rather than risk that they do not grasp the importance of seeking help when in doubt. Also, in the aftermath of critical event, it is possible to look at present routines and practices in order to consider improvements. A person that refrains from seeking help from colleagues or others, even when he or she clearly needs it, is likely to perceive that the act of asking for assistance has some kind of social cost that they are unwilling to pay. Lee (1999, 2002) has proposed that there are three specific categories of social cost associates with seeking help. First, by asking for help one acknowledges incompetence and oneâs own inability to solve problems and find solutions by oneself. Second, a person seeking help acknowledges inferiority to other people in terms of knowledge, skills, and resources. Third, help seekers acknowledge their dependence on other people, and admit that they cannot complete a particular task along, but only through the efforts and contributions of others (Lee, 2002, p. 18). All of these categories of social cost have links to self-esteem. Admitting more or less publicly that you are not sufficiently competent, inferior, and dependent upon other peopleâs contributions can disrupt a personâs feeling of self-efficacy and being able to take care of him or herself. What will other people think of me, now that they have seem how dependent I am of help? These social costs can serve to explain the tendency to refrain from seeking help. The doctor studentâs reluctance to seek help can be understood in the light of these theoretical propositions. He most likely wanted to avoid social costs in all three dimensions. First, he did not want to acknowledge incompetence, but instead had the ambition to make a good impression on colleagues and leaders at the mental hospital. Second, being a student he was already in some sense inferior to the other people in the workplace, and would not want to have the perceived gap in knowledge, skills, and resources widened even further by asking for help. Third, he acknowledges that he came into the organization with a plan to be perceived as an independent and autonomous person, someone who would deserve excellent references and offers of further"

The net impact of this stigma was that any physicist who openly criticized or even seriously questioned these foundations (or predictions) was immediately branded as a âquack.â â Clauser continues by noticing, âTo be sure, there remained alive a minority of the theoryâs founders (notably Einstein, SchrÃ¶dinger, and de Broglie) who were still critical of the theoryâs foundations. These men were obviously not quacks. Indeed, they all had Nobel Prizes! Instead, gossip among physicists branded these men âsenile.â â As time passed by, another, more optimistic phase of the perception of quantum foundations followed, which, however, might not have sufficiently and critically reflected the previous evangelical theoreticiansâ orthodoxy. On the contrary, quantum mechanics has been marketed to the public and to policy makers alike as a hocuspocus type capacity [522]. This author believes [504] that interpretation is to the formalism what a scaffolding in architecture and building construction is to the completed building. Very often the scaffolding has to be erected because it is an indispensable part of the building process. Once the completed building is in place, the scaffolding is torn down and the opus stands in its own full glory. No need for auxiliary scaffold any more. But beware of those technicians who claim to be able to erect skyscrapers without any of those poles and planks! In addition, when it comes to claims of applicability of the formalism, and its ontological commitments, the suppression of semantic content in favour of mere syntax makes us vulnerable: in many ways the formalism could be extended to domains in which it cannot be applied safely and properly. Thereby, the resulting certifications, alleged capacities and predictions could be wrong. Hence, if it comes to utilize the formalism, interpretation serves not only as scaffolding, but also provides guiding principles and precautionary methods of evaluation and application."

8,278,0.939,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","15.1 Many Years Ago In 1964, as a CERN Fellow I started doing research on hadron physics, using at first bubble chambers and then electronic detectors. Like many other Fellows I was able to benefit from the vigorous CERN academic training program and from its teachers, all of whom were excellent physicists. There I met Rolf Hagedorn for the first time and enjoyed his lectures as well as his âYellow Reportsâ. His lectures were deep and clear. His reasoning was precise and very rigorous, yet he was patient with us and had a sense of humor. For example, once at the beginning of a lecture, he told us about a competition between ethologists of various nationalities for the best essay about âthe elephantâ. While all the others described some facet of the elephantâs personality, such as its character, its mental and physical capabilities as well as its elegance or its love-life, the German competitorâs essay was entitled: âOn the definition of the elephantâ. Hagedorn then continued: âat the end of this lecture, you will not have the slightest doubt about my nationality!â . Fifteen years later, during a discussion on a possible heavy ion experiment, I reminded him of the elephantâs joke; he smiled and forgave a somewhat imprecise definition of mine. In the 1960s, Hagedorn developed a statistical approach to describe particle production which led to the concept of a finite limiting temperature for hadronic matterâthe Hagedorn temperatureâand to the formulation of the statistical bootstrap model [1] in which the exponentially rising hadron mass spectrum occurred naturally. This major discovery, however, had to wait a few years before being fully appreciated, since at the time there was no fundamental theory of the strong interactionâand no consensus on how to construct one."

It was speculated that maybe quarks are so heavy that they would be practically unobservable. Bootstrap thermodynamics was presumably the best way to calculate qq production rates as a function of their mass (applying perturbation theory to this problem was a then fashionable nonsense). The model was used to predict [17] KK, pp, dd, and qq pair production with the result that the production rates of the first three agreed with experiment and that for quarks a mass of 4â5 nucleon masses would make them practically unobservable (with the techniques known at that time), even if they could, in principle, exist as free particles. If anyone had suggested to me then a qq plasma, I would have declared it impossible (alas, again). One often-heard objection to the model was that resonances (inside a fireball) would not live long enough to justify treating them as âparticlesâ. Matthiae [18] proved, using the principle of detailed balance, that they might just live long enough. It was tempting to apply the model to astrophysics: the Big Bang and neutron stars [19]. This triggered a number of papers, notably the one by Huang and Weinberg [20] and by Wheeler [21]. The then proposed âlimited temperature (T0 ) Big Bangâ depended entirely on the (at that time reasonable) interpretation of the model as yielding an infinite energy density at T0 . For an easily readable summary of the situation up to 1972, see [14], where no prior knowledge about statistical bootstrap is required."

Indeed, as will become clear, the Veracruz context was probably the most brutally repressive one we investigated in this project. In our broader project, we also investigated the effect authoritarian rule continues to have on its citizens beyond borders (Glasius 2018; Dalmasso 2018; Del Sordi 2018; Michaelsen 2016), and we occasionally refer to this field of research in Europe too. We also draw on our collective fieldwork experience from previous projects, in the countries mentioned above as well as in the authoritarian or transition contexts of Cameroon, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Tunisia, and the short-lived âTamil Eelamâ controlled by the Tamil Tigers. Hence, we bring together a tremendous amount of fresh, cross-regional experience in the authoritarian field, as well as rich knowledge of the relevant political science and area studies literature. We have devoted frequent group sessions both to preparing for our fieldwork, and to reflecting on our experiences afterwards. We were helped tremendously with this by the three ethical advisors we sought out to think through our dilemmas: Marcel van der Heijden, program manager at HIVOS and an expert on Central Asia and the Middle East; Dirk Kruijt, professor emeritus at the University of Utrecht and an expert on Latin America and the Caribbean; and Malcolm Smart, a human rights professional who has managed various regional and other programs for Amnesty International, Article 19, and Human Rights Watch. We take this opportunity to thank them for their advice and support. These discussions between ourselves and with our advisors, and the realization that in previous projects we had not had the benefit either of written guidance, or of an exchange of experiences and practices, gave rise to this book. Our reflections and recommendations in this book are based on our individual experiences. Where many of us have very similar experiences, not only during the fieldwork for this project but also in previous fieldwork episodes, we have taken the liberty of abstracting from these incidents or practices and formulated more general findings. Wherever possible, we have engaged with the existing literature so as to be on firmer ground in our quest for generalization. In many other instances in this book, where our experiences are more varied, contradictory, or even unique, we just describe what our practice is or what has happened to us as an individual experience. Importantly, we want to emphasize that one should not read the experiences of, for instance, our China or Iran researcher, as âthis is what it is like to do field research in Chinaâ, or âthis has been the experience of political scientists going into Iranâ.

192,240,0.939,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"previous verdict. Two professional legal experts are brought in to argue in favour and against a reversal of the earlier decision, and two fractions line up, so that a drama of college politics unleashes. Quickly, dissensus among the college fellows increases, tensions build up, suspicion proliferates and the political force field splits in two. The reconsideration procedure is formally opened on April 22, 1954, with a leather-bound Victorian ledger, holding a collection of Palairetâs notebooks, exhibited on the table. The case is a delicate one from the very outset. A piece of deliberate scientific fraud is in itself already considered a rare and highly unlikely event. All Fellows agree that the photograph in Howardâs thesis had been deliberately faked, but the question is: by whom, Howard or Palairet? Before Palairetâs notebooks reached Skeffington, they went through the hands of Nightingale, a Palairet supporter. Was it credible that Nightingale had seen the photograph and pulled it out? If the photograph now missing from the notebook had been present, and if that photograph had been a fraud, then that fraud (a case of self-deception, perhaps) must have been committed by Palairet. But again: why would a distinguished scientist, a member of the Royal Society, at the age of seventy-two suddenly revert to faking his results, thereby jeopardize his lifeâs work? There seemed to be no motive, nothing much to gain from such an act, for Howardâs mediocre work hardly added anything to Palairetâs reputation. On the other hand, âthe psychology of scientific fraud is often a mysteryâ (p. 230). Howard himself is unable to explain how the tainted photograph had gotten into the experimental data. Palairet must have provided it, but Howard cannot remember how or when. There were many photographs, he tells the jury, and he was just trying to finish his thesis in time. He never saw the original negative and only used the evidence as it was provided. Without it, his thesis would not have been approved. On a previous occasion he had even declared that he was not interested in discoveries at all, that he just wanted to publish some papers and âplay the gameâ. On the other hand, everything fitted into place once the premise was accepted that Palairet had done it. But this would mean that the photograph now missing from Palairetâs notebook had been consciously removed, in order to preserve Palairetâs reputation and justify Howardâs dismissal. Someone who was pro-Palairet and anti-Howard apparently desired to have that photograph out of the way. In other words, a fraud, a suppressio veri (286), had occurred twice, involving the same picture; and this shifted the focus of suspicion to Nightingale. The latter however claims that, when he looked into the notebook, the picture had still been there and that nothing seemed wrong with it at all. How then could the photograph have disappeared when the notebook was next opened? Was it Skeffington himself perhaps? Interestingly, as the narrative unfolds, everyone who is confronted with this toxic photograph, this toxic piece of evidence (Palairet â Howard â Nightingale - Skeffington) becomes tainted or infected by it, finding his integrity questioned, his reputation damaged. Eventually, after much intrigue and bargaining, the âcurves of justiceâ lead to the reinstatement of Howard. With the smallest possible minority it is concluded that the testimony is not sufficient to support the order which had been given for the âdeprivationâ of Howard. But this is not the end of the dispute, for the next issue on"

If companiesâor the state for that matterâknow us better than we know ourselves, an âemotional dictatorshipâ governing us without our knowledge or consent is right down the road.

78,322,0.939,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In his Die AufklÃ¤rung in the Age of Philosophical Engineering Stiegler (2013) accepts the challenge introduced by Tim Berners-Lee, who argued that âwe are not analysing a world, we are building it. We are not experimental philosophers; we are philosophical engineersâ (Halpin 2008). Berners-Lee was not merely describing the activities of the architects of the World Wide Web he invented. He was calling them to account for the impact of their engineering on the constitution of mind and society. He was inviting them to build a new res publica. Stiegler is more careful. He suggests that digital technology is a pharmakon: âit can lead either to the destruction of the mind, or to its rebirth (ib.).â Referring to Wolf (2008) he notes that the transition from the reading mind to the digitally extended mind entails substantive changes to the composition and behaviour of our brains. Though these changes may be cause for celebration, they also threaten the constitution of the self. In the course of his text Stiegler reiterates the crucial question of what we need to preserve as a valuable heritage of the era of the âreading brainâ (Wolf 2008). I want to connect this with the need to reconstruct the social contract, recognizing its modern roots and its contingency on the ICT infrastructure of the printing press. A new social contract would have to align with the novel technological landscape, co-opting current ICTs to incorporate checks & balances. In that sense we will need a hybrid social contract that testifies to the agency-characteristics of smart environments.3 Though we might wish to declare âGame over for modernityâ, this may require us to give up on the social contract that protects against immoderate government. Let us remind ourselves that the end of modernity would not necessarily be the end of totalitarian governance. The hidden complexity of computational layers in fact affords refined and invisible manipulations that may be closer to the totalitarian nightmares of Kafkaâs Trial (Solove 2004) and Forster Machine (Forster 2009) then to the dictatorial schemes of Big Brother watching you. Stiegler (2013) notes that the spread of traceability seems to be used primarily to increase the heteronomy of individuals through behaviour-profiling rather than their autonomy."

A more recent study on the political risks of field research in Central Asia found that â(s)everal respondents reported that they no longer work in Uzbekistanâ and a âfew respondents singled out Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan as sites where they have experienced significant censorship/restrictions, chosen not to go, or experienced difficulty goingâ(CESS 2016, 7). Goode (2010) initially discerned a relation between Russia becoming more autocratic and a decline in fieldwork, but qualified his conclusions in a later study of the broader region (Goode 2016). Nonetheless, we would logically expect the most repressive regimes within the authoritarian universe to be less likely settings for field research: either because it would be too dangerous, or simply because it is impossible to gain access. Similarly, assessments of feasibility and risk are likely to constrain the choice of research topics and research questions. We do not expand on this point, since it has been dealt with extensively by the contributions to Observing Autocracies from the Ground Floor (Goode and Ahram 2016). At the level of our own considerations and observations of colleagues, the notion of constrained country choices, and associated knowledge gaps, seems to have validity. Our Kazakhstan researcher for instance made a clear choice, within Central Asia, not to do research in Uzbekistan for safety reasons. We know no one who has done fieldwork in Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, or North Korea. We know colleagues who have started doing research in Myanmar only after it democratized from 2011. And more dramatically, we know many colleagues who have abruptly stopped doing research in Egypt when it became much more repressive in recent years."

Indeed, I believe that one of my external reviewers learned of my book through the review process and then invited me to speak in a grad course via Skype on the topic.â Ben Doyle described how Palgrave Pivot has changed the way he commissions: âIn terms of the kind of material that weâve seen submitted for the format, the variety really has been surprising. Iâve published slightly more focused studies that require more room than a journal article affords but that couldnât be usefully padded out to monograph length. That said, Iâve also found the Pivot model to be a good length for particular types of work â work written in a more essayistic style, for instance, or work that adopts a more polemical tone. Many of the academics that Iâve discussed the format with have viewed it as an excellent length at which to make an initial intervention into an emergent area upon which other academics can then build.â9 Attitudes often change slowly in academia, and Palgrave Macmillan was prepared for adoption of the mid-length format to take some time.

116,86,0.939,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"by promoting ideals of authentic leadership (Gardner et al. 2011). One basic assumption in this research field is that great leadership requires great character (Kiel, 2015). On this view, the leaders need consistently to embody virtuous character traits in their everyday dealings with employees and other stakeholders. By doing so they can serve as good role models in their organizations and contribute to making responsible conduct the normal way to behave in the workplace. Kiel (2015) also suggests that leaders of morally strong character generate more income to their companies. However, the causal relation may also go the other way. The study in question documents that companies with leaders who are perceived to be morally strong outperform those with leaders who are perceived to be morally weak, but it may be easier to embody virtuous character traits when you are in charge of a successful company rather than a struggling one where you can have economic incentives to cut corners. The concept of authenticity has ancient roots, and is integral to the Socratic notion of knowing yourself. An authentic person is someone with a high degree of self-awareness, who acts in accordance with his true self by expressing what he genuinely thinks and believes. Aristotle defined self-realization and well-being â eudaimonia â as a state of happiness where the person acts and lives in accordance with who he really is. Crucially constitutive of eudaimonia is the exercise of virtues. Only people who possess virtues like courage, honesty, and loyalty will truly flourish and be happy in the eudaimonian sense. To be a virtuous person is to have a certain kind of mindset, a deeply entrenched set of dispositions to act in a particular manner. A truly honest person does not tell the truth out of blind habit, because it is the best way to make a good impression on others, or out of fear of the consequences of being caught in a lie. Rather, the honest person thinks that âit is the truthâ is a particularly strong â if not always overriding â reason for speaking the truth. Similarly, a virtuous doctor considers âthis is the right treatment for my patientâ to be a particularly strong reason for providing that particular treatment to the patient, overriding self-interest and other considerations. Virtue can come in degrees. Aristotle distinguished between full virtue, where an honest person tells the truth without experiencing any trace of a contrary temptation to lie, and less than full virtue where the person telling the truth has to overcome a desire to do otherwise. The latter is also an honest person, as long as his reasons for telling the truth are not opportunistic, but based on a conviction that telling the truth is DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0012"

Note that a structurally identical puzzle arises if âWordâ is replaced by âConceptâ and âMy assertionâ is replaced by âMy judgmentâ. Both Objectivists and Subjectivists are subject to this puzzle, and they both should give some sort of answer. However, Subjectivists seem not to have thought of a difference between the noun-phrase conceptual combination {SANDY; SWIM } and the sentential conceptual combination {SANDY IS SWIMMING}. Nor has it seemed to occur to them that in order to give a concept-analysis of some noun phrase like a man who is tall, there needs to be a sentential analysis of the embedded relative clause (as well as an analysis of the contribution of âaâ, as mentioned above in Sect. 8.1.2). This puzzle is at least as old as Plato, and has provoked considerable discussion over the centuries. One type of answer might be to postulate a copula-like intermediary, call it âexemplificationâ, with the idea that it is this intermediary that causes the other items to merge into a full sentence. But as one can pretty easily see, this just leads to some sort of infinite regress: for, now there needs to be a further explanation of how it is that âKimâ (or the person corresponding to that name) can combine with this newly postulated object to then be able to combine with ârunsâ (or the object corresponding to that predicate). This is known as Bradleyâs Regress, or The Unity of the Proposition/Sentence problem. Objectivists have proposed various answers to the Unity problem, one of the most popular being some variant on the metaphor of saturated/unsaturated from Frege (1892a). The idea is that singular terms are such that they are designed to designate âindependentâ or âsaturatedâ objects, whereas predicate terms are designed to designate âunfilledâ or âunsaturatedâ items, namely âconceptsâ. (Recall that for Frege and the Objectivists, a concept is a non-mental, abstract entity.) When these two different kinds of entities âmeetâ, the saturated object âfills inâ the unsaturated object, producing a new, saturated objectâa complete sentence (which expresses a âthoughtâ, in Fregean terminology. . . where âthoughtâ is also understood as a non-mental, abstract item). Well, whatever one thinks of such metaphorical accounts (and something akin to this is adopted in Formal Semanticsâ model-theoretic theories), it is at least some sort of explanation, showing that there might be some wiggle room in Objectivist theories that would provide an appropriate description of what is going on. However, it seems that Subjectivist accounts are not in such a good place, at least not if they hold that lexical concepts designate mental items like concepts. For it seems that this would presume there to be a concept of INSTANTIATIONâsort of a mental version of the linguistic exemplification, and now it appears that the Bradley regress can start. Subjectivists of the sort we have been considering will respond by claiming that conceptual combination is how they handle this topic. But it should be noted that conceptual combination in these works is defined for noun-noun and adjective-noun combinations (perhaps also for adverb-verb combinations?). But this wonât work for sentence generation: perhaps the conceptual combination of DOG and"

46,142,0.939,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"fourth issue concerns rights and institutions: there exist no social policy institutions on the global level and no functioning legal framework that would guarantee social protection from poverty. This is a major obstacle, and while most cosmopolitans argue that such global institutions are needed, most particularists contend that they will not succeed for various reasons. In the case of child poverty in welfare states, the situation looks different. Here we have states which all have at least some kind of social policy in place; social protection and poverty alleviation is embedded in certain social rights directly granted to families in poverty or children in poverty. It is therefore much less necessary to debate whether global institutions are feasible and if so, in which form. Although we support the view that child poverty in welfare states is best tackled by changing the international and global institutions, most of the work needs to be done in welfare states themselves in terms of designing and implementing more inclusive social policies and allotting enough funds to support poor children and their caregivers. It seems likely that cosmopolitans and particularists will come to very similar conclusions in regard to child poverty in welfare states, both probably agreeing to some extent that its alleviation is first an issue of social justice within a rich state (or a community of them, like the EU) and that global justice is not primarily concerned with it. The reduction of child poverty in richer countries is part of an ideal of global justice but not its primary problem. Our own account will analyze the relation different agents have to children in poverty, and we will then try to attribute responsibilities based on a set of morally relevant criteria; in this sense, we will defend what the literature calls an agent-centered approach (Deveaux 2013; OâNeill 2001). Instead of focusing on one or two important agents, like the state and the family, we wish to distinguish more of them, including those with limited responsibilities. Furthermore, we wish to emphasize that there are some very important agents who often get neglected in theories of responsibilities; in this context, we point to peers and enterprises, for instance, which raise particularly challenging questions for the concept of responsibilities towards children affected by poverty. All this leads to the conclusion that child poverty is not only a social policy issue but touches many policy areas: the labor market, public infrastructure, health care, education. Before we outline our own theory, let us briefly comment on one of the few philosophical debates that has emerged on the topic of responsibilities towards children and why we connect our argument only loosely to it and build it mainly on other approaches to responsibilities which have not so far addressed the specific case of children. The debate we have in mind"

As shown in the book, individuals are not only exposed to changing political contexts but are also confronted by their personal past and present experiences, which serve as the backdrop against which they rethink the past in the present. By now we have become so sensitive to the idea of the flexibility of the past that we tend to forget that it restsâat least to a certain degreeâon an experiential base (Irwin-Zarecka 1994: 17). Appadurai (1981) argues that the past does not offer an infinite source for interpretation but is always told within certain cultural norms and rules. In this book I have demonstrated that the past is not an unlimited resource by showing how it is genuinely influenced, not only by a predefined discursive space but also by peopleâs personal experiences.

117,148,0.939,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"contract does not concern goods, but instead a person who is vulnerable and non-exchangeable in their uniqueness. The relationship between the surrogate and the parents-to-be is the third relationship of special importance in surrogacy arrangements. Little attention is paid to this topic in scientific discourse, but for this analysis it is crucial to show that the surrogate and the commissioning parents are not just contract partners, but also interrelated in an ethical manner. Levinasâ concept of âthe thirdâ offers an interesting insight for the analysis of this special relationship, as it shatters the private relationship between the self and the Other and introduces a different, although still ethical, quality. As StÃ©phane MosÃ¨s points out, the third is different from the Other in the sense of proximity, quantity and its selection: The third is further afar than the Other, it is numerous instead of unique, and it is the only one in an ethical relationship that is freely chosen (MosÃ¨s 1993). The surrogates meet the criteria: they are usually miles away from the commissioning parents, it does not matter to them exactly which surrogate carries their child to term, and it is they who choose to enter a surrogacy arrangement and involve a third party in their family planning. However, for Levinas, the third does not need to be conceived as a visible empirical human being. Instead, it is best interpreted as reminder that other people who are not part of a personal relationship and differ from the self in terms of ethnicity, sex, status or religion must be considered as well. The third interferes with the relationship of the self and the Other and thereby challenges the privileged position of the Other. Thus, it opens up the frontiers of thinking. The relationship to the third is not personal anymore, but refers to the sphere of justice and equality.9 Therefore, the third is also allied with institutions and universal laws instead of the particularity and context-sensitivity that is part of personal relationships. Levinas comments on the difference between the Other and the third as being a difference in thinking: [â¦] what seems to me very important, is that there are not only two of us in the world. But I think that everything begins as if we were only two. It is important to recognize that the idea of justice always supposes that there is a third. But, initially, in principle, I am concerned about justice because the other has a face. (Levinas et al. 2005, p. 170)"

These swirls and slashes of light are just not precise enough. Perhaps you once saw a movie in which a couple of sailors signaled to each other across the sea with blinking lights. In another movie, a spy wiggled a mirror to reflect the sunlight into a room where another spy lay captive. Maybe thatâs the solution. So you first devise a simple technique: Each letter of the alphabet corresponds to a series of flashlight blinks. An A is 1 blink, a B is 2 blinks, a C is 3 blinks, and so on to 26 blinks for Z. The word BAD is 2 blinks, 1 blink, and 4 blinks with little pauses between the letters so you wonât mistake the 7 blinks for a G. Youâll pause a bit longer between words. This seems promising. The good news is that you no longer have to wave the flashlight in the air; all you need do is point and click. The bad news is that one of the first messages you try to send (âHow are you?â) turns out to require a grand total of 131 blinks of light! Moreover, you forgot about punctuation, so you donât know how many blinks correspond to a question mark. But youâre close. Surely, you think, somebody must have faced this problem before, and youâre absolutely right. With a trip to the library or an internet search, you discover a marvelous invention known as Morse code. Itâs exactly what youâve been looking for, even though you must now relearn how to âwriteâ all the letters of the alphabet. Hereâs the difference: In the system you invented, every letter of the alphabet is a certain number of blinks, from 1 blink for A to 26 blinks for Z. In Morse code, you have two kinds of blinksâshort blinks and long blinks. This makes Morse code more complicated, of course, but in actual use it turns out to be much more efficient. The sentence âHow are you?â now requires only 32 blinks (some short, some long) rather than 131, and thatâs including a code for the question mark. When discussing how Morse code works, people donât talk about âshort blinksâ and âlong blinks.â Instead, they refer to âdotsâ and âdashesâ because thatâs a convenient way of showing the codes on the printed page. In Morse code, every letter of the alphabet corresponds to a short series of dots and dashes, as you can see in the following table."

We understand it was left to volunteers to work through the problems as best they could.

Given his role in deï¬ning dignity as an inviolable characteristic of human beings, it is worth looking at his philosophy in a little more detail. Kant was not a preacher who developed his own moral code, but a thinker who believed that most human beings had the ability to distinguish good from bad actions intuitively.

Not only the structure of these relations deserves further inquiry, but also its implications for social relations and human existence. What do all of these new information and communication technologies do to us, from the new and unanticipated relations we develop with them? I will limit myself again to the relations of âimmersionâ and âaugmentationâ that I described above. In the relation of immersion, the material environment changes from a relatively stable background of our existence into an interactive context that interferes in novel ways with the ways we live our lives. Smart environments with âambient intelligenceâ are changing the character of the spaces in which our lives take shape. When public spaces are equipped with smart cameras that can detect suspicious behavior, new norms will be installed. When the doors in geriatric hospitals will have RFID chip readers, they can automatically determine who should be allowed to go out and who does not. When toilets will have sensors that can detect specific substances in our urine and feces, new norms regarding health and illness, and new regimes for healthcare will emerge. Moreover, these âintelligentâ technologies can also interact with our decisionmaking processes. Under the name of âpersuasive technologiesâ, products and systems are being developed to persuade people to behave in specific ways. School toilets can detect if children have washed their hands when they leave, and urge them to do so when they forget. Smart mirrors in the waiting room of medical doctors can recognize oneâs face, and morph it into an image of what you will look like in 10 years if you donât give up smoking, or eating too much, or working too hard. Smart windows in shops can determine the direction of oneâs gaze and give extra lighting to articles that seem to interest specific people. In the configuration of augmentation, technologies like Google Glass have the potential to radically change the character of social interactions. The mere look at somebody else can be enough for a face recognition system to look this person up on the Internet. This would result in a drastic reconfiguration of the boundaries between the public and the private. All oneâs private activities that are on the Internet will be much more easily accessible. And all resulting information will be available in social interaction in a asymmetrical way, because people cannot see if the person they meet is simultaneously checking them on the Internet.

390,711,0.938,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SW,"Chapter Twenty-Eight seriously flawed. This fundamental problem often makes it maddeningly difficult to find something specific in Google Books. Almost in complete contrast to Google Books is JSTOR (www.jstor.org), short for Journal Storage, a collection of academic journals whose articles have been organized and catalogued in a gloriously meticulous manner. JSTOR started out as a restricted site, but after a shameful incident involving the prosecution and tragic suicide of a programmer determined to make the contents of JSTOR freely available, it has been made much more accessible to the general public. For those who can read traditional Western music notation, the International Music Score Library Project (imslp.org) is to music scores what Google Books is to books. IMSLP is an enormous repository of digitized scores that are no longer in copyright, and they are fortunately catalogued and indexed in a highly usable manner. If you think about the ideas of Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson in regard to the ability to create our own web of documents, something seems to be missing. Websites such as Google Books, JSTOR, and IMSLP are resistant to the type of arbitrary linking that they envisioned. Modern word processing and spreadsheet applications accept storing links to sources of information, but not in a very flexible manner. The website that comes closest to Wellsâs concept of a World Encyclopedia is obviously Wikipedia (wikipedia.org). The basic concept of Wikipediaâan encyclopedia that can be edited by its usersâcould easily have resulted in something that degenerated into chaos and consequent uselessness. But under the studious and conscientious direction of Jimmy Wales (born 1966), it has instead become the single most essential website on the internet. In World Brain, H. G. Wells wrote An Encyclopedia appealing to all mankind can admit no narrowing dogmas without at the same time admitting corrective criticism. It will have to be guarded editorially and with the utmost jealousy against the incessant invasion of narrowing propaganda. It will have a general flavour of what many people will call scepticism. Myth, however venerated, it must treat as myth and not as a symbolical rendering of some higher truth or any such evasion. Visions and projects and theories it must distinguish from bed-rock fact. It will necessarily press strongly against national delusions of grandeur, and against all sectarian assumptions. It will necessarily be for and not indifferent to that world community of which it must become at last an essential part. If that is what you call bias, bias the World Encyclopedia will certainly have. It will have, and it cannot help but have, a bias for organization, comparison, construction and creation. It is an essentially creative project. It has to be the dominant factor in directing the growth of a new world."
375,43,0.938,Musical Haptics,"2.5 Implications of a Coupled Dynamics Perspective on Learning to Play an Instrument At the outset of this chapter, we proposed that successful acoustic instruments are those which are well matched, in terms of their mechanical impedance, to the capabilities of our bodies. In other words, for an experienced musician, the amount of work they need to do to produce a desired sound is within a range that will not exhaust their muscles on the one hand but which will provide sufficient push-back to support control on the other. But what about the case for someone learning an instrument? What role does the dynamic behavior of the instrument play in the process of learning? Even if we do not play an instrument ourselves, we are probably all familiar with the torturous sound of someone learning to bow a violin, or with our own exhausting attempts to get a note out of a garden hose. This is what it sounds and feels like to struggle with the coupled dynamics of our bodies and an instrument whose dynamical behavior we have not yet mastered. And yet violins can be played, and hoses can produce notes, so the question is how does someone learn to master these behaviors? Musical instruments represent a very special class of objects. They are designed to be manipulated and to respond, through sound, to the finest nuances of movement. As examples of tools that require fine motor control, they are hard to beat. And, as with any tool requiring fine motor control, a musician must be sensitive to how the instrument responds to an alteration in applied action with the tiniest changes in sound and the tiniest changes in haptic feedback. Indeed, a large part of acquiring skill as a musician is being able to predict, for a given set of movements and responses, the sound that the instrument will make and to adjust movements, in anticipation or in real time, when these expectations are not met. The issue, as Bernstein points out, is that there are often many ways of achieving the same movement goal [20]. In terms of biomechanics, joints and muscles can be organized to achieve an infinite number of angles, velocities, and movement trajectories, while at the neurophysiological level, many motorneurons can synapse onto a single muscle and, conversely, many muscle fibers can be controlled by one motor unit (see Sect. 3.2 for more details concerning the hand).

As modelers or researchers, we must discipline ourselves to work more closely with our clientsâ the planners, managers, and other specialists who are responsible for the development and operation of our water resource systems. We must study their systems and their problems, and we must identify their information needs. We must develop better tools that they themselves can use to model their water resource systems and obtain an improved understandingâa shared visionâof how their system functions and of their available management options and associated impacts or consequences. We must be willing to be multidisciplinary and capable of including all relevant data in our analyses. We must appreciate and see the perspectives of the agronomists, ecologists, economists, engineers, hydrologists, lawyers, or political and regional scientistsâyou name itâas appropriate. Viewing a water resource system from a single-discipline perspective is rarely sufï¬cient to meet todayâs water resource systems planning challenges. Even if we have successfully incorporated all relevant disciplines and data in our analyses, we should have a healthy skepticism about our resulting information. We must admit that this information, especially concerning what might happen in the future, is uncertain. If we are looking into the future (whether using crystal balls or mathematical models), we must admit that many of our assumptions, e.g., parameter values, cannot even be calibrated let alone veriï¬ed. Our conclusions or estimates can be very sensitive to our assumptions. One of our major challenges is to communicate this uncertainty in understandable ways to those who ask for our predictions."
340,191,0.938,Complications and Quandaries in The Ict Sector : Standard Essential Patents and Competition Issues,"From a patent law perspective, the SEP-holder is required to prove the merits of the patents it asserts against a licensee, just like in any patent infringement dispute. It cannot therefore force a potential licensee to take a âblack-boxâ license to its entire portfolio, and seek royalties based on the number of patents in the portfolio, because this would imply that all those patents are essential, valid, and infringed, without the need to prove it. This is conï¬rmed by the fact that generally courts only adjudicate FRAND royalties for the speciï¬c patents asserted in litigation, supposedly the strongest, not for the entire portfolio. For example, in Vringo v ZTE, ZTE did not agree to pay a global FRAND rate for Vringoâs portfolio without proof that its products actually practiced Vringoâs patents, and that those patents were valid.15 The English High Court rejected the notion that ZTE should pay royalties for patents it did not use and/or were invalid, and added that this did not make ZTE an âunwilling licenseeâ.16 Notably, the court warned that SEP disputes resulting in a global portfolio license do not give Vringo the right to impose such a license on ZTE: [i]n some ways I believe the position adopted by Vringo in this dispute confuses the true nature of its legal rights. Its rights are and are nothing more than patent rights. Although it is a truism that disputes of this kind often end up with a global licence, one needs to be careful turning that truism into something like a right to compel a defendant to enter into such a licence. The truism does not alter the character of Vringoâs underlying rights.17"

Because of the Russian gender system, this age and gender difference probably helped in obtaining interviews from the busy IT directors and managers. Moreover, in the interview situation some of the interviewees took a âteaching positionâ, which was often helpful in terms of creating an overall picture of the field. Most important, however, is to acknowledge that the gender difference most likely emphasized some aspects of the phenomenon studied and concealed others. Substantially, both Russian business and the IT field are maledominated areas of life. This provoked a lively discussion between one of our female respondents (team leader, p37) and the female interviewer about the role of women in the IT business. The respondent noted that women are treated differently, and those starting from the bottom in the IT business have a harder time than men. This difference is, however, of complex character and contains several contradictory elements. According to her, being a woman has negative consequences until one has gathered enough experience, when the gender factor âstarts to function strongly in your favor.â Moreover, there are both places âwhere they donât take you because you are a womanâ and places âwhere they will take you exactly because you are a woman.â The respondent also related the gender aspect to the nature of the male Russian âwork collectiveâ in IT business: Firstly, many [Russian IT professionals] think that women cannot work as programmers. Secondly, many think that it is a crazy idea to take a woman into a company consisting of 20 men, because this spoils the collective and the mood of the men. And then one has to remember that women have a tendency of taking maternity leave. In the firm I worked at earlier, practically all of the women took maternity leave.

The results are however is in line with the ï¬ndings in [22], which underlines this paradox when hiring in the software industry. To answer our ï¬rst research question: What is the trend for soft skills requirements for testers? we compared the result of our analysis with a similar study from 2012 [19]. In the set of ï¬ndings [19], by analysing the trends in requirements for soft skills, we observe that there is a stronger need for team-playing skills, fast-learning skills, independent-work skills and openness and adaptability skills. Agile software development puts an emphasis on teamwork having a central role in software development, therefore, being a team-player is essential. There is little literature on fast-learning skills. However, we can assume that, given the rapidly changing tasks and requirements, testers have to learn fast concepts, tools or even whole new domains, such as accounting or statistics to perform their work. We know that independent-working skills are directly related to how much activity is required of the learner. If one can work independently, then the burden of supervision, control, and feedback for the individual learner or the team is decreased [23]. Therefore, independent-learning is a desirable skill, in order to decrease the burden on the team. Both openness and adaptability are traits that need to be fostered within development teams, and the explanation is it makes it easier for team members to admit their own mistakes, to negotiate, listen and facilitate [6]. Therefore, it is explainable that the request for these skills has increased, as a consequence of the desire of software companies to go overpass mistakes sooner and with fewer consequences. It is unclear why the demand for communication skills has such a signiï¬cant fall. Even the agile manifesto makes communication a central part of software development. Therefore, an explanation for a down-trend in the demand for communication is that has become such a common trait that the job advertisers do not speciï¬cally mention it. Concerning new categories of skills required of testers, the most important is work ethics. Job advertisers speciï¬cally ask for integrity and trustworthiness, in both relations with customers and team members. They ask for a work done with professionalism ï¬rst and foremost. Customer focus is a close second. There are speciï¬c requirements for testers to test through the customersâ perspective and to keep into account customersâ needs. An interpretation of the agile manifesto [24] sets the customer as an integral part of the development team; therefore more customer-focus is not surprising. Testers are speciï¬cally asked to be proactive, in the sense of picking-up and fulï¬lling job tasks, rather than wait and be told what to do. It can be a sign that there is a tendency in the software development to move away from micro-management to autonomous teams [25]. Job advertisers seem to exhibit a trend now in asking for responsibility-related skills; they emphasize the candidate to be able to deliver deï¬nitive work and well-grounded work results. We can translate this requirement by that work half-done is not accepted. One has to ï¬nish their job, and one has to prove that their work results are correct. Other notable new demands are the ability to work under pressure, the ability of critical-thinking, be motivated, committed, detail-oriented and quality-oriented. We consider it to be a positive signal the small number of requests for multitasking (4%), as this practice, especially inter-projects, is often associated with a loss of effectiveness [26]."
46,176,0.938,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"to take away their children, because the harm of being taken away would be less severe than the harm of staying in the family. Poverty would then fall into the same category as abuse and severe neglect, which also count as legitimate reasons for state intervention today. In fact, empirical research shows that children from poor families are more often taken away, and it has also been suggested that social workers are more likely to intervene in poor families than in richer ones, even if the level of neglect or abuse is similar. We now want to discuss why parents are not fully responsible for being poor and why this leads to the conclusion that even if poverty should constitute falling under the threshold necessary to uphold parental rights, parents should be supported instead of having their children taken away. Most people in poverty are not poor by choice, in the sense that they wish to be poor. The question is whether poor parents can be seen as being poor because they made bad and wrong choices, which lead them to become poor against their will and desire. This would be evaluated as a kind of deserving poverty. The first argument that speaks against such a conclusion is that poverty is very often grounded in childhood, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty suggests that people move through the life course on a trajectory that is very hard to change. It is certainly not impossible to escape poverty, but it is hard to because of the many disadvantages we discussed, like deprivations in health and education. The second argument in favor of our conclusion is the structural nature of poverty. The economic crisis of the last years pushed millions of people into poverty and made it much harder to escape it, showing impressively that the individual is dependent on the economic and social chances she finds. If there are simply not enough jobs available, someone will be unemployed, and if the economy changes in a way that transfers jobs from one country to another, the individual worker with a family and a mortgage to repay simply cannot move along (in fact, in most cases this would not help much, since it would still be too expensive). The counterargument, that uneducated persons are much more vulnerable to poverty, captures only one dimension and so must be rejected at least partly. Educational choices are in many countries made very early and depend on such things as available schools in the neighborhood or the support from parents. Children cannot control them, and when they reach an age at which they can be held partially responsible for their educational achievements and choices, it is often too late. We do not wish to dismiss adolescents completely, but they are at least partially the victims of their circumstances and the environments in which they grew up, which makes it more likely that they will leave school early,"
262,127,0.938,"Reality Lost : Markets of Attention, Misinformation and Manipulation","Being informed about something requires having correct, factual information about the subject (Kuklinski et al. 2000). The opposite is not to be uninformed but to be misinformed. If you are uninformed about something, you do not necessarily have a belief about what the facts are. You may, like Socrates, at least know that you know nothing. If on the other hand you are misinformed, you have factually false convictions that you believe to be true. Misinformation misleads citizens, politicians, and journalists. One may misinform others unintentionally by passing on information that is believed to be true but which turns out to be false. If, on the other hand, the misinformation is intended (as hard as that may be to assess or prove), it is disinformation (SÃ¸e 2014). Had the Bush administration itself believed in 2003 that Saddam Hussein commanded functioning weapons of mass destruction ready to be fired, the argument for going to war was a case of misinformation to the public.

Rosa, whom we got to know in Chap. 3, recounted that she had been asked by a neighbor: âWhy do you continue to work when you have two children working for the government?â Rosa told me this to exemplify la mentalidad (the mentality) that circulates among many people. If you have children working for the government they are able to pull strings in order to provide the things you need. And as government workers they are well positioned for getting their hands in the honey jar one way or the other. However, I suggest that it is a highly fictitious intellectual exercise to separate corruption at state level from corruption in other spheres of society (be it the business community or any other public or private institution or enterprise). Corruption is part of multi-vocal bundles of social practices that are thriving upon ambivalent norms and values, socially codified strategies for regulating supply and demand and historical formations of power and privileges. Thus, in essence, we need to understand how templates of corruption are historically dense and intimately intertwined with broader processes of state formation and social relations, forming part of a broader set of discourses and practices embodying and articulating social and political moralities. As this chapter has demonstrated, the Bolivarian discourse harbored on the one hand, a profound tension between everyday realities of social and political life, and on the other, ideals and visions of a different moral order that could engender a more just and harmonious society."

Those concerned with microaggression frown on statements such as, âThere is only one race, the human race;â âAmerica is a melting pot;â and âWhen I look at you, I donât see colorââfor âdenying the significance of a person of colorâs racial/ ethnic experienceâ and sending the message that they should âassimilate/acculturate to the dominant cultureâ (Examples of Racial Microaggressions n.d.). âI believe the most qualified person should get the jobâ is interpreted to promoting a myth of meritocracy and suggest that people of color and women are lazy (Tool: Recognizing Microaggressions n.d.).

Other I/O devices are less obvious, such as circuits to play sound and music, circuits to connect to the internet via an ethernet connector or Wi-Fi, circuits that pick up Global Positioning System (GPS) signals to tell you where you are and where youâre going, and even devices that detect gravity and motion to determine how your phone is oriented and moving relative to the earth. But the subject of this chapter (and the next three chapters) is the CPU, which is sometimes called the âheartâ or the âsoulâ or the âbrainâ of the computer, depending on your metaphorical preference. Chapter 20 described a Triple-Byte Accumulator that consisted of a counter to access memory, an adder, and latches. Everything was controlled by circuitry that used codes stored in memory to add and subtract numbers and later to write a running total into memory. A CPU is very much like that Triple-Byte Accumulator, except that it is generalized to respond to many different codes. Consequently, a CPU is much more versatile than that previous machine. The CPU that Iâll begin building in the pages of this book will work with bytes. That means it can be categorized as an 8-bit CPU or an 8-bit processor. But it will be capable of addressing 64K of random-access memory, which requires a 16-bit memory address, or 2 bytes. Although an 8-bit CPU primarily works with bytes, it must also be capable of working with 16-bit values to a limited extent in connection with this memory address. Although this CPU wonât exist in the material world, it will (in theory, at least) be capable of reading code and data from memory to perform many different types of arithmetic and logical tasks. In terms of arithmetic and logic processing capabilities, it will be equivalent to any other digital computer, no matter how sophisticated. Over the years as 8-bit CPUs gave way to 16-bit CPUs and then 32-bit CPUs and 64-bit CPUs, these more advanced CPUs did not become capable of different types of processing tasks. They instead perform the same tasks faster. In some cases that speed makes all the differenceâfor example, when the CPU is decoding a stream of data that encodes a movie. An 8-bit CPU can do this same processing, but it would probably be too slow to display the movie at the speed at which it was meant to be seen."

The main character Mr Chance is a simple-minded gardener, who lives with a wealthy benefactor in Washington DC. When his employer dies, he is evicted, and after landing himself in a car accident, he ends up in another well-off household, this time with solid political connections. Chance is portrayed as someone who is illiterate, has never been outside, and has learnt almost all he knows from television, yet, he is hailed as an inspirational ï¬gure in Washingtonâs political milieu. His simple phrases â repeating what he has seen on television and banal observations about plants and gardening â are interpreted as deep and profoundly insightful, and all good qualities are attributed to him: he is seen to be extremely cultured, highly educated, socially sophisticated and sexually attractive. Chance becomes an advisor to the president and a media darling, and in the ï¬nal scene, we hear high-level ofï¬cials whispering that he should become the next president; he is universally popular, has no history and âhasnât said a thing that could be held against him.â According to Dawson (2009, 210), Hal Ashby felt that television could be both âthe greatest tool in the worldâ and âthe greatest detriment in the world.â Being there portrays a world where the minds and souls of individuals and the core values of civilization are both hollowed out by television. Mr Chanceâs character embodies the immaturity and stunted growth that sceptics warned about in works such as The Plug-in-Drug (Winn 1980), and the social destruction proclaimed by Postmanâs (2005a) and others in the 1970s and 1980s. Many comical moments in Being there derive from Chanceâs inability to distinguish between television and reality, as well as his copycat behaviour, when in doubt he takes his clues from television. From the very beginning of the ï¬lm we see Chanceâs life completely intertwined with television, a set wakes him up in the morning, and when he is not tending to plants, television is his only focus. Other events are portrayed as mere interruptions to his television-induced ï¬ow; for example, when he is told that his benefactor is dead, he shows no emotions, but only says âIt looks like itâs going to snow,â repeating what was just said on the weather report. He generally views the worlds as if it was a TV-show.

387,9,0.938,CHAPTER 5 âRapt Up with Joyâ:,"Once illness struck, the preparation for death intensified considerably: the sick were entreated to perform various acts of piety, such as prayer, Bible-reading, and repentance.32 Through carrying out these devotions, the dying demonstrated their inward faith, which in turn was evidence of Godâs grace and salvation after death. Although the preparation was, in theory, the responsibility of the sick themselves, in the case of children, great dependence was placed upon relatives to initiate and guide this behaviour. They did this chiefly by asking their children if they thought they were dying or whether they were willing to die. In 1680, Lady Elizabeth Andrews from Buckinghamshire enquired of her thirteen-yearold daughter Margaret, âMy Dear, Are you so ill that you think you should die?â33 Three hours later the girl died. While it might seem cruel to question a child on such a foreboding subject, in the early modern period the practice was considered quite the opposite: ultimately, parents wished to help their children to reach a state of happiness about dying. By asking simple and direct questions about death, the child was given the opportunity to voice any anxieties and receive reassurance.34 The young would have been accustomed to this question-and-answer format, since catechism was the standard method of religious education in this period; this familiarity may have been comforting for children.35 It must be noted that in Calvinist theology, the idea that deathbed behaviour could influence the destiny of the soul was flawed: the doctrine of predestination taught that God had already decided who would be damned or saved, and nothing could be done to change His mind.36 However, in practice, families hoped that they held some sway over their salvation, perhaps considering that God had foreseen their godly conduct and built it into His plan.37 This was even the case for puritans, individuals traditionally regarded as the strictest proponents of predestination.38"

Zivkovic both relays information from other sources, commenting on it and explaining it to readers, and provides longer commentaries, for example on issues of science policy. He assumes that his readers are interested in science, but does not generally presume in-depth knowledge of scientific topics. This approach is in line with Zivkovicâs own background: while he is a trained scientist and writes from a first-hand perspective, his agenda is not that of someone paid for full-time research. While RRResearch presents both the results of research (rarely) and frames scientific issues for a scientific audience, ABATC translates scientific topics for a more general, non-specialist audience. The issues are much broader there than they are in RRResearch, where they align much more strongly with the bloggerâs own research interests. The latter blog is a window into the mind and daily work of the researcher, not a friendly conversation with a lay audience. This is not to say that RRResearch doesnât engageâits success illustrates how well it achieves this goalâbut whom it targets as its readership and what function it wants to realize remains at least partially unclear. Redfield uses her blog to frame issues for herself and her peers, while Zivkovic blogs for a readership with their needs squarely in mind. Much of the research that he relays is not his own, while much of what is discussed in RRResearch is Redfieldâs own work, or closely related to it. Whereas Redfield regards her blog as an instrument for communicating what she is currently working on or issues she is more generally interested in, Zivkovic provides a service and measures its success, at least in part, by its popularity and the amount of feedback he receives, a form of impact that may well be less relevant to a blogger like Redfield, who might be primarily concerned with her blogâs reception among her students and peers (Fig. 4)."

As the epigraph to Chap. 3 eloquently evoked, having oneâs âpapersâ in order is fundamental to upholding these rights. Papers also need to be in order when contemplating international migration itself: for many of my respondents, the realisation that they needed proofs of identity in order to travel was the prompting factor in registering (i.e., registering their identity, their personhood) with the authorities. Many of my respondents did not procure birth certificates, let alone passports, until the time when, as young men, they thought about emigrating. This underlines the initial transition the men had to make from a society of origin where such modern proofs of identity were unnecessary for day-to-day living, to a new society where such documents of personhood are essential and everyday tools of inclusion. In Luhmannian terms, this individual act of migrating to Western Europe represents the transition to a functionally-differentiated society in microcosm. The men had spent the first twenty-five years of their lives quite happily without a piece of paper stating who they were. This changed abruptly when they began to be confronted by state officials demanding certain documents in exchange for certain rights being recognised. These demands have only grown stronger as the men make the transition to retirement, a testament of their life-long struggle to achieve social inclusion and uphold their rights. In summary, home can be about belonging to a territory, a localisable space, just as it can be about belonging to a social collective (household, community, nation). But I have argued that to be âat homeâ can also mean upholding oneâs claims to domicile and personhood in order to achieve inclusion in different social systems. To repeat, this is not to deny the importance of place-belonging and group-belonging as constitutive of home. Instead, it is to recognise the growing complexity of social relations. If Luhmannâs claim that society has become more complex and differentiated is accepted, then it becomes interesting to explore the implications of his theory for our thinking about home. Luhmannâs insights about societal inclusion are particularly relevant in light of a recent piece of legislation which uniquely targets older hostel residents and their relationship to home. The final section of the book considers the prospects for this legislation and the people it is addressed to."
92,168,0.938,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"In 2014, I led a team to organize the inaugural network for global health at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) to which several institutions were invited.

Commitment alone on my part was not enough, however. There needed to be institutional support from key leaders at the university. The credit for the primary institutional champions goes to Dr. Michael Adewumi. As the vice provost for global engagement at PSU, it was Michaelâs vision that created a PSU global engagement network (GEN) with strategic partner institutions in different regions. The initial invitations to the inaugural network for global health were sent to the GEN institutional partners to participate in a 2-day meeting during which the global health network was launched. Well-deserved credit also goes to Dr. Nan Crouter who as the Dean of the College of Health and Human Development supported my plan to not only host this event but also for the college to be the academic unit host for the new network. With the support of an incredible team of staff (Jodi Heaton as my assistant and Nathan Jones and the web master) we launched the network with 13 universities represented, including 3 from the US â NYU, Minnesota and Michigan. Following the inaugural meeting, Professor Neil Sharkey, as vice president for research, provided 50% of the initial funds that was matched by both Crouter and Adewumi which allowed the network to fund pilot projects over 2 years. I would like to reiterate that it took committed leaders at PSU to launch the network; institutional commitment is critical to initiating and sustaining a network such as this one. As a network, my vision was to challenge us to draw on lessons from commerce and trade in reframing spaces for engagement in partnership. For example, how do we ensure that the"

The Council also suggests that it will re-evaluate costs of nuclear power considering the impact of the accident. Given public opinion polls (more than 60 % of the public are now in favor of âphasing outâ nuclear power), âreducing dependency on nuclear powerâ is probably the likely outcome of the new energy policy. But it is not yet certain how soon, how much, and what other energy sources will fill the gap. Fourth, we must address implications for international society. This accident is not just a Japanese accident, and has already had significant impacts on the global nuclear energy picture. There are more than 400 nuclear power plants worldwide and it is critically important to assure the safety of those plants. In this context, it is Japanâs responsibility to share our information and experiences as much as possible. One concern is that the world is now clearly divided into two groups, âpro-nuclearâ and âanti-(including phasing out) nuclear.â This trend, which existed before but was much more subtle, is now clearly changing the global politics of nuclear power. It is getting more difficult to reach a consensus on nuclear energy policy, although there is a growing consensus on enhancing nuclear safety in general. At the recent UN Conference on Nuclear Disarmament held in Matsumoto City, Japan, July 27â29, 2011, there was an interesting discussion on civilian nuclear power. Under the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), Article IV guarantees the âinalienable rightâ of the peaceful use of nuclear power by member countries. But Ms. Yoriko Kawaguchi, former co-chairperson of International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament (ICNND), suggested that there should be âresponsibilityâ concerning use of nuclear power. However, there was a strong statement by Dr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that âglobal use of nuclear power will continue to grow in the coming decades and it will remain an important option for many countries.â There was still another important issue emerging from the Fukushima accident. That is the common characteristic of ânuclear safetyâ and ânuclear security,â especially the safety and security issue associated with spent fuel storage which has become a major policy issue for the international community. I would like to conclude my talks with the following remarks. First, we should be able to overcome this tragic accident with our wisdom. Never give up. Yes, this is an unprecedented crisis, but crisis can be an opportunity. We will draw lessons and come up with innovative ideas to improve the safety of nuclear power plants and to clean up the site. If we cannot control nuclear energy, how can we control nuclear weapons? We should overcome this man-made disaster with a humble attitude towards nature and science/technologies. I truly believe that the international community can work together with Japan to overcome this crisis. Second, letâs make Fukushima a symbol of ârecovery.â Hiroshima and Nagasaki were victims of nuclear destruction, but became symbols of âpeace.â"
13,323,0.938,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"There is much less desire involved in the descriptions of sexual encounters among the women, and their characterisations are actually not so different from the ones given by the women in the middle generation. Many of them depict their first time as a painful affair, involving blood and horror, while others laconically state that it was no great experience. In addition to Eva, who proclaimed that âsex is funâ, only Stine, who also had a painful first time, actually describes sexual excitement where âthe bodies live togetherâ. When feelings enter the picture, women still tend to talk about sexual experiences in relational terms, as the ultimate intimacy, sometimes as a testimony to their erotic power over the boyfriend, in addition to being a way to feel grown-up. The sexual experience itself is not highlighted, and we recognise some of the instrumentality from the women of the previous generation, although not as explicitly. The question is whether explicit sexual desire is still defined as a masculine affair even though both norms and practices are more degendered and individualised. Does this imply a gendered inertia when it comes to questions of the body and sexuality that seem to go slower or even resist other degendering processes?"

Despite its merits, the account has two limitations. On the one hand, what one ought to achieve is often not what she can do in a single choice or action, but in a series of choices or actions. On the other hand, we may take a current choice to dominate another not because the immediate outcomes ensured by the former have higher value than those ensured by the latter. It may be because, when we look further into the future possibilities, the former opens a series of actions leading to future outcomes that have higher values than those to which the latter may lead us. This is what brought Horty to his theory in Horty (2001) of strategic ought with a single agent. There are nevertheless some problems when Horty approaches his notions of strategic acts and strategic oughts, one of which is related to the notion of independence concerning choices for different agents at different moments. The problems are not really in the theories of strategies developed by Belnap and Horty, but in their applications or relations to other theories. We may then proceed safely to expand their theories of strategies, and discuss the problems in some other place. This section and the following two expand Belnapâs theory of strategies to the extent that we can talk about what different groups may do in the same strategy field. In doing so, we restrict ourselves to âprimary strategiesâ, as Belnap calls them, or âirredundant strategiesâ, as Horty calls them. Notions and most terms are inherited"

We are not adding skills to context (as the COM-B model implies): context lies at the heart of complex ï¬uid and, oftentimes confounding knowledge combinations. Or, as McCormack puts it: ânothing exists and can be understood in isolation from its contextâ (2015: 3009). On the basis of our research and learning, we would argue that far from a skills deï¬cit we are in a situation of knowledge saturation; clinical skills/ information are not the primary problem and using clinical âexpertsâ as conduits for yet more skills-forcing interventions is neither efï¬cient nor effective. To the contrary, it is both arrogant and wasteful. This arrogance does not derive solely (although this certainly does contribute) to the imposition of âexpert informationâ from the global North: from wellmeaning but narrow thinking foreign clinical experts and âdonorsâ. It is the consequence of a failure to see the bigger picture â of narrowing disciplinary knowledge paradigms. Although the lack of patient management is recognised as an issue by all UK clinicians working in Uganda: it was a visiting Ugandan obstetrician who proposed the initiative to introduce the African Maternal Early Warning Score (AMEWS) into Mulago Hospital. Enthralled by its apparent success in the UK (visiting foreigners are often not exposed to or fail to see the fundamental weaknesses of UK systems) she quite understandably attempted a âpolicy transferâ approach: she âsawâ a clinical solution to a clinical problem and tried to transfer it. And as a project we sought to support her in this without comprehending the localised knowledge that would ultimately render it unsuccessful. Knowledge can be both enabling and disabling; it is not only a deï¬cit of skills/knowledge that hampers progress; narrow siloed knowledge (focused on harvesting facts) can limit our ability to see the social world and the truth that lies behind interventions. Resistance to change may be fuelled by knowledge and often quite entrepreneurial tacit localised knowledge. From an individual perspective â how to make ends meet and sustain your family â or, from a systems perspective â how to organise and funnel the rewards from systemic forms of corruption â requires a level of localised tacit knowledge and rational/entrepreneurial decision making that foreign volunteers may fail to âseeâ.

308,155,0.938,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Integrity Some healthcare professionals refuse to comply with the requests of their patients or with the decisions of their colleagues on grounds that to do so would compromise their core belief. The physician may refuse to do abortion, on grounds of religious beliefs, or he/she may refuse to change the gender of his patient (transsex), which he/she insists to do. The current system of medical rules allows the physician to abstain from such managements, but he is required to transfer the patient to another physician who will comply with the patientâs requests of such operations. The value of moral integrity is beyond dispute. It means soundness, reliability, wholeness, and integrations of moral character and being faithful to moral values and standing up in their defense if necessary. The medical profession and its constant demands may deprive us of the liberty to structure and integrate our lives as we see ï¬t, and that will affect our integrity. Persons may lose their integrity if they lack sincerity and steadfastness in keeping their fundamental moral convictions, especially if the exigencies of their ever-demanding job enforce them to practice things which they do not believe. Such exigencies may be rare in Western countries, but they are not so rare in third world countries. A gynecologist in a third world private hospital may be sacked from his job if he adamantly refuses to perform any abortion, not indicated medically. Such a person usually believes in the sanctity of life and, hence, he may also stand against do not resuscitate (DNR) policy agreed upon in certain codes where any further management becomes futile.

249,262,0.938,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"2.4 Unknown Statements I have said that the assertibility of Â¬(Â¬ K Î± â§Â¬ K Â¬Î±) does not exclude the existence of the fact that neither Î± nor Â¬Î± are known. Can the intuitionist assert the existence of such a fact? I think not, and in this section I shall try to motivate this opinion. Let me observe first that âK Î±â, in all its possible readings, clearly is an empirical statement, not a mathematical one. I have argued elsewhere that the negation of many empirical statements, and in particular of K-statements, cannot be plausibly equated to intuitionistic negation Â¬, and I have proposed that it be equated to Nelsonâs strong negation â¼.26 So, if we add â¼ to the language LIPLK of Intuitionistic Propositional Logic plus the operator K, and we assume for simplicity that all the empirical sentences of LIPLâ¼,K have proofs,27 we must add, to the Definition 2 of the notion of proof of K Î±, a definition of the notion of proof of â¼ K Î±. Here is my proposal: Definition 5 Whenever one is presented with something that is not a proof of Î±, a proof of â¼ K Î± is the observation that what one is presented with is not a proof of Î±. It should be noticed that Dummettâs remarkâthat intuitionistic truth, when it is equated with the actual possession of a proof, does not commute with negationâis certainly correct when it is understood as referring to strong negation. For example, the observation that what one is presented with is not a proof that it is raining is not the same thing as the observation that what one is presented with is a proof that it is not raining. As a consequence, Dummettâs objection to the validity of the (T) schema as a criterion for being a truth operator seems to cause trouble in this case. However, in this case the argument (9) is no longer valid: the second step is an application of contraposition, but contraposition is not valid for strong negation. As a consequence, the fact that strong negation does not commute with truth does not entail the invalidity of the (T) schema. We can therefore conclude that, even when we add to intuitionism strong negation, the knowledge operator K is a truth operator. 25 A discussion of this assumption is beyond the limits of this paper. 26 Reference [24]. 27 In general empirical sentences have (non-conclusive) justifications. A definition of the notion of justification for the sentences of LIPLâ¼,K presupposes a solution of Gettier problems. I have suggested such a definition in [23]."

In this sense taxation can be said to be a âtotal social phenomen[on]â which, according to Marcel Mauss, has three obligations: to give, to receive and to give again. Taxes have been givenâtaken is perhaps more appropriate as most taxpayers do not have a choiceâbut there is clearly an expectation of receiving something in return. Taxation also create expectations on other members in society; that they also give and receive something backâon approximately the same level as I do.

Why? With Python version 2, the first alternative gives what is called integer division, i.e., all decimals in the answer are disregarded, so the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. To avoid it, we may introduce an explicit decimal point in either the numerator, the denominator, or in both. If you are new to programming, this is certainly strange behavior. However, you will find the same feature in many programming languages, not only Python, but actually all languages with significant inheritance from C. If your numerator or denominator is a variable, say you have 1/x, you may write 1/float(x) to be on safe grounds.

185,116,0.938,The Essence of Software Engineering,"a map that supports the crucial practices, patterns and methods of software engineering teamsâ. We also identified the following general principles deemed as essential to finding a kernel (also in [4]): Quality, simplicity, theory, realism and scalability, justification, falsifiability, forward-looking perspective, modularity and self-improvement. Theory meant âthe kernel shall rest on a solid, rigorous theoretical basisâ, realism and scalability âthe kernel shall be applicable by practical projects, including large projects, and based where possible on proven techniquesâ, self-improvement âthe kernel shall be accompanied by mechanisms enabling its own evolutionâ. Moreover, the vision statement [4] also formulated what features the kernel should have: Practice independence, lifecycle independence, language independence, concise, scalable, extensible and formally specified. Scalable was explained as the kernel must support the very smallest of projects â one person developing one system for one customer â it must also support the largest of projects, in which there may be systems-of-systems, teams-of-teams and projects-of-projects. Extensible meant the kernel needs to possess the ability to add practices, details and coverage, and to add lifecycle management and to tailor the kernel itself to be domain-specific or to integrate the software development work into a larger endeavor. With these criteria, principles and features the SEMAT team set out to find the kernel. Followed by the language To explain the universals in the kernel and also practices and methods we need a language. Using just English is not precise enough so we need to have a formal language with syntax and semantics. The language must be designed for its principal users who are professional software developers participating in a software development endeavor. The language must also allow competent practitioners to create and improve practices without having to learn an advanced language. The language should support four principal applications: Describing, simulating, applying and assessing. From [4]: âThe concept of state is likely to play an important role in the kernel language, to represent work progress.â The same vision statement gave rather specific requirements on the language. For example âThe language should be designed for the developer community (not just process engineers and academics)â, which is an important requirement asking for a more intuitive and more engaging user experience in working with methods than what has been available today. Another example of a requirement is that the language must provide âvalidation mechanisms, so that it is possible to assess whether a project that claims to apply a given method element : : : actually does, and is not just paying lip service to it.â We need more than a kernel â we need practices and methods The role of the kernel and the kernel language is to be used to describe practices and methods with a common ground. To get there, a useful common ground had to be applied in describing a large number of methods. We needed to agree on what a practice and a pattern is [4]. We said for example: âA practice is a separate concern of a method. Examples are : : : iterative development, component-based"

252,139,0.938,The Ethics of Vaccination,"This is not to say that we should not try to address peopleâs concerns about vaccines through other policies, such as appropriate information campaigns or strategies aimed at promoting trust between doctors and citizens. Of course, compulsory vaccination would have to be accompanied by policies aimed at increasing peopleâs confidence in vaccines, so that they would be more likely to comply with legal requirements. But we do need to ensure that everybody contributes their fair share to the achievement of the preservation of the public good of herd immunity; and to this end, compulsory vaccination is the ethically acceptable and indeed ethically obligatory policy measure to adopt. It is ethically acceptable because it only compels individuals to fulfil an ethical obligation they independently have (as discussed in Chap. 2), and not to do something supererogatory or beyond the âcall of dutyâ. And it is ethically obligatory because fairness itself ought to be an aim of vaccination policies, and fairness demands that everybody take on themselves an equal share of the burdens entailed by the realization of herd immunity; it is unlikely that anything less than compulsion would get closer to this goal. At the same time, compulsory vaccination also fulfils the ethical requirements of expected utility, of fairness, and of the least restrictive alternative. Let us briefly review in what ways the ethical case for compulsory vaccination complies with the three fundamental ethical requirements of public policies. As for expected utility, compulsory vaccination is likely to be highly effective at achieving the stated goal, in that it would allow for the highest possible vaccination rates compared to any other policy (with the exception of forced vaccination), provided the legal penalty is sufficiently burdensome and adequately implemented. As for fairness, compulsory vaccination would distribute the burdens of such collective enterprise in the fairest possible way, again with the exception of forced vaccination. As for liberty, compulsory vaccination does not infringe on any liberty right not to be vaccinated, because such rights do not exist in this context. One might reasonably observe that there is a difference between adult and child vaccination. For instance, parents do pay taxes and thus make personal sacrifices for the sake of the collective good, but children are obviously not required to make an equivalent contribution, given that they do not have the resources or the capacities to do it (indeed, they are on the receiving, as opposed to contributing, end of important goods). So how do the requirements of fairness, according to which each individual ought to make their fair contribution to herd immunity, apply to children? We obviously do not expect those who do not have the resources or the capacitiesâsuch as children, but also those who live in extreme povertyâto"

Since relaxed accesses do not provide synchronisation, we disallow ownership transfer through them. Therefore, we require that the release predicates connected with the relaxed messages are satisfiable with the empty resource. This condition, together with the requirement that the released resources satisfy acquire predicates, forbids ownership transfer via relaxed accesses. The resource missing from the discussion so far is the write resource (modelling the WÏ (x, X) assertion). Intuitively, we would like to have the following property: whenever a thread adds a message to the memory, it has to own the corresponding write resource. Recall there are two ways a thread can produce a new message: 1. A thread performs a write. This is the straightforward case: we simply require the thread to own the write resource and to update the set of value-timestamp pairs recorded in the resource accordingly. 2. A thread promises a write. Here the situation is more subtle, because the thread might not own the write resource at the time it is issuing the promise,"

Those were the slap happy days when local treatment was a magnificent pseudo-science â not even now do we have much understanding of how local applications work â and internal treatment was a desperate matter of letting justice seem to be done, not too critically . . . . But in the last fifteen years there have been remarkable advances in the chemical and antibiotic field. Treatment is becoming so specific that there is much to be said for a proper diagnosis before starting it. Penicillin has made syphilis so rare that it is easy to forget its existence. Anti-tuberculous drugs have ruined for us a fascinating, a lovely group of dermatological conditions. And now griseofulvin.112 Williams stated that in his clinic the âexperience so far has been so gratifying that it is difficult to be restrained about what seems to be happeningâ. He gave the drug a ringing endorsement, stating âgriseofulvin is a remarkable drug with minimal toxic effects and that it has come to stay, we have no doubtâ.113 Questions remained about dosage, resistance, re-infection and toxicity, yet in a call-to-arms, he concluded, âAs Montgomery must have said, the break-through has been achieved and our forces can now pour through the gap to consolidate our gains.â114 Harvey Blank, who worked at the University of Miami School of Medicine, had also been prompted by Gentlesâs article to obtain griseofulvin from Glaxo.115 He first tried it on âa desperate and unique caseâ of T. rubrum infection, with some success, before a more organised trial on 31 patients with various forms of ringworm. The results were âuniformly favorableâ, though he cautioned that toxicity still needed to be tested with prolonged use, and that it was too early to say anything about the likelihood of relapses. Nonetheless, the drug was cleared for use in the United States in July 1959, less than a year after Gentlesâs paper had been published.116 Blank organised a symposium on griseofulvin in Miami in October 1959, funded by McNeil Laboratories, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, at which 37 papers were given by speakers from 11 countries, including Gentles and Williams. The rapid spread and trialling of the drug indicates the intense medical interest, across so many countries, that there was in finding oral antifungal drugs. Introducing the proceedings in Archives of Dermatology in May 1960, Blank reflected that the development of griseofulvin âappears to be assuming the proportions of an historical natureâ.117 A key factor in the enthusiastic response in the United States was to explore the potential of"
247,50,0.938,Humanities World Report 2015,"innovation in a way that complements the sciences and cannot be replaced by them. This is the point made by Jobs. And in a companion AHRC report to the one just quoted, we found the following claim:26 Arts and humanities knowledge tends to be more particularistic, more tacit and less easy to communicate formally. This has implications for how this knowledge is created and shared with others. Yet, because they are less amenable to codification, the arts and humanities are better placed to disrupt and challenge standardised practices and conventional wisdoms. ... The arts and humanities add to the overall diversification of knowledge creation. They offer distinctive approaches to the understanding of human experience and activity. If innovation is to thrive, it must exploit the knowledge from the entire spectrum of an integrated research base. We have already mentioned the fact that the different values of the humanities can overlap. It is particularly important to stress this in the context of innovation. For instance, when commentators talk of the humanities promoting innovation, they might well be using this as a way of talking up their economic value as in, the humanities help promote economic value by providing innovative ideas and models to business. In social policy, the humanities may lead policy makers to consider proposals that would otherwise not have occurred to them, to break out of old habits of thinking.27 In the case of cultural heritage, we have already mentioned the way in which the humanities can serve to question and revise preconceived views (or even myths) about national memory. This is yet another form of innovation. In current European Union policy thinking a strong case is often made for the necessity of nurturing social innovation alongside technological innovation and, as we shall see in Chapter 8, this is a point that is often picked up by humanities advocates, who argue that social innovation may be nurtured by research into human motivations, behaviour and entrepreneurship. On the other hand, many humanist scholars mistrust appeals to innovation as a âbuzzwordâ. They may claim that innovation is not an end in itself; that not all innovation is good (e.g. in the arena of cultural heritage, governments can misuse the humanities in order to invent nationalist identities).

Many community activists were highly critical of their fellow neighbors whom they perceived as demanding not only toward the state, but also toward the voceros and other people in the community that were actively participating in various projects. Often, these community activists experienced that they got little gratitude in return, and instead received scolding, accusations and criticism. Many of the internal conflicts of the communal councils were related to the different and contradictory understanding of what these organs were supposed to provide, who was responsible for providing it and how. I once asked Candy, a community activist in 23 de Enero, why she thought that it was so difficult to organize people. They were dealing with the problem of mobilizing enough people to stand for the elections they were organizing. She answered dryly: âI have been everywhere in these streets. There is nothing new you can tell me. I know Venezuelans. They want you to bring them a bag of food, then"
212,214,0.938,Life Cycle Management,"Many corporate LCA experts are telling us they have difficulty communicating their findings to the internal stakeholders. One of the problems is that the results are not well understood by their colleagues in marketing, research and product development. It is as if they operate in different worlds. LCA results do not really connect to what their internal clients want to know. This means many are seeking ways to drastically simplify results or translate them into guidelines. Getting the results out and understood is a problem, getting data in is another big problem. Often other departments are not really motivated to supply data. Getting access to data held by the purchasing department, for example, can be very difficult as they do not see the benefits. The general picture that emerges is that the LCA department finds it difficult to connect and to be relevant, while at the same time companies have committed themselves to improve the sustainability of products in a rational way. This seems to imply that there is a disconnect between the ambitions of the companies and what"

We started to chat, and I soon noticed that something was wrong. After a while he told me that he had resigned from his position as financial spokesperson. The other faction had smeared him, spreading rumors in the community that he was corrupt and that he hadnât done the rendiciÃ³n de cuenta (present the balance sheets) to the community, even if that was a lie. They had also claimed that he hadnât done any work in the communal council, which also was a lie, and the evidence was there for everyone to seeâthe work was visible there in the community, stairways, several new houses built and others reconstructed, and above all a huge project of drainage and reconstruction of a hillside on the outer slope of the community that put the houses on its edge at risk for landside. He got up and found his resignation letter for me to read. It was signed on June 6, 2011, two weeks after I last saw him. The letter stated that he resigned because of the campaign against his good name and honor, and the untruthful accusations against him and his work as the financial spokesperson. The letter was stamped with the communal councilâs seal. Every time I had visited Alfredo during the past years, he had showed me the accounting books for the communal councilsâeverything listed in orderly columns and accompanied by a folder of neatly stacked receipts and invoices documenting the purchases that the communal council had made. In spite of the two housing projects that he had helped develop, his house had not been rehabilitatedâthe poor and crumbling apartment with humidity stains on the ceiling was certainly a testimony to that. Indeed, when he made a pot of coffee before we sat down to talk again, I realized that he didnât even have a cup in his cupboard that wasnât broken. In spite of Alfredoâs trajectory as a long-term renowned community activist he had become more vulnerable to power plays after the last electoral round, when he was elected for the second time. In the former communal council he had been accompanied by several long-term friends and alliesâall of them long-term activists in the community. But in the last elections the other faction had orchestrated to outmaneuver him, rushing the elections with the help of a promotor in Fundacomunal who according to Alfredo was involved in the âcomplot,â and adding new people to the electoral list from an area adjacent to the communityâan area that, it was disputed, did not belong to the communal council. They had all voted for the other faction, probably"
266,169,0.938,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Community Oriented Policing and Technology in 2017â What Do We Need to Consider? When pondering about the benefits of technology we need to first and foremost address the concept of âuniversal valuesâ. It is just too often assumed that policing a given community is subject to a set of universal values and all it takes to improve police-community relations is to improve the communication process between these two entities, and when it comes to technology simply provide both parties with more efficient tools to report misconduct and respond to the call for service in a speedy manner. In reality, things are just much more complicated. While many of us would agree that killing a person, in a premeditated manner, or physically abusing a child should constitute some examples of these universal values, the truth is that in many communities, practices of genital mutilation, honour killings or child abandonments are not considered as horrific as many of us might think and, on the contrary, members of these communities would find such behaviours as acceptable and certainly not subject to report to the local law enforcement. We have seen examples of such conduct in the United States and some European countries (Haberfeld 2018).

To get at this, consider a STIT choice situation with the same two states, but now only one equivalence class [w1 ] = [w2 ] = {w1 , w2 }. Now the agent only has one choice c. We cannot label the two transitions by c now, since that gives a PDL model with the same event, and it is unclear how this would fit the scenario. Here the difficulty is not that we cannot label the transitions: We can introduce different events for them, say e and f . In fact, this makes sense even in STIT, since histories consist of events, and as we said earlier, if two histories are different, this is because different events take place on them. But this still does not address the matter of the choice structure, and crucially related to this: how we interpret the branching in our PDL model.8 What emerges here is an ambiguity in the usual talk about PDL models. In particular, what do branchings mean? Sometimes, people talk as if these are conscious choices a process or an agent can make, sometimes as if they are variations that cannot be predicted. What we need to distinguish the two senses is precisely the notion provided by STIT, that of control. In our first scenario, the two labels c1 and c2 , when added to events, divide them into two control equivalence classes. In the second scenario, adding the label c to both e and f indicates how the events belong to the same control class. The agent cannot choose between the events."

It is in this atmosphere, I so argue in my analysis of the accounts by Robert Davis, Diana Friel McGowin and Larry Rose, that patients follow traditional narrative concepts. In agreement with early criticism of these narratives, I identify them as deploying linear plots and established myths.6 But reading them from the vantage point of greater temporal distance, and in the context of Hawkinsâs illness narrative criticism as well as Couserâs ethical considerations, I believe these authorial choices to be purposeful for the patientsâ wider political cause. At the time of publication, these narratives appealed to a readership primed for the caregiverâs accomplished account. Complying with their readersâ expectations, patients could begin to gather an audience that learned to appreciate the patientâs continued personhood. It is against this changing background that slightly later published narratives could attempt a presentation that reï¬ects the patientâs narrative capabilities more credibly. My comparison of Cary Smith Hendersonâs narrative fragments to Thomas DeBaggioâs highly articulate and literary composition illustrates how patients struggled to ï¬nd narrative forms that would embrace the plot of their disease, while leaving space and scope for continued identity and personhood within this trajectory. I close this chapter with an analysis of the account of a Harvard cardiologist about his Parkinsonâs disease with rapidly progressing Lewy body dementia. Building on life-long experiences from the vantage point of a practicing clinician, Thomas Graboys now takes the viewpoint of the patient. His change in perspective enables him to bring the patientâs agenda to an audience that authoritatively includes the medical profession. Several years into patient life-writing, this agenda now can move on from the recovery of identity and personhood directly to address matters such as end-of-life treatment and choices."
294,32,0.938,Programming For Computations - Python : a Gentle introduction To Numerical Simulations With Python (Volume 15.0),"1.2.4 Why You Must Use a Text Editor to Write Programs When Python interprets some code in a file, it is concerned with every character in the file, exactly as it was typed in. This makes it troublesome to write the code into a file with word processors like, e.g., Microsoft Word, since such a program will insert extra characters, invisible to us, with information on how to format the text (e.g., the font size and type). Such extra information is necessary for the text to be nicely formatted for the human eye. Python, however, will be much annoyed by the extra characters in the file inserted by a word processor. Therefore, it is fundamental that you write your program in a text editor where what you type on the keyboard is exactly the characters that appear in the file and that Python will later read. There are many text editors around. Some are stand-alone programs like Emacs, Vim, Gedit, Notepad++, and TextWrangler. Others are integrated in graphical development environments for Python, such as Spyder. This book will primarily refer to Spyder and its text editor."

Of course, they try to develop an infrastructure which is at least potentially useful once their target group has populated the platform. This might attract a number of early adopters who will eventually lure further users until a critical mass has been reached. While this strategy has worked for many Internet start-ups, it is not easily applicable for SNS. The problem here is that new members will only understand the early adoptersâ attraction once they have built up their own networks within the platform. Therefore, the effective usage of SNS requires a critical mass of users both on a global and also on an individual level.

Waldau was born in 1965. She was born into a secular home, but her grandfather, Willis SÃ¤we, with whom she had close and positive contact during her childhood, was an important figure of leadership in the early Swedish Pentecostal Movement. Waldau recalls that she had a salvation experience at the age of 16, when she accompanied a friend to a teenage camp in the Sanctification Union (HelgelsefÃ¶rbundet), one of the Swedish free churches.3 A little later, in the Pentecostal Movement, she discovered what she now considers to be most important to her: an emphasis on the individualâs personal experience of and relationship to God, as well as closeness to Jesus. Waldau also found the Pentecostal teachings to be consistent with what was written in the Bible. Another aspect she found important was their emphasis on love and fellowship between followers. Waldau says that she had always been more attracted to the teaching to do good to one another, to create the community Jesus preached, than to the charismatic aspects of looking for âsigns and miracles.â Additionally, these egalitarian values were important for Waldau, the putting into practice of the idea that Godâs will is sought by the community as a whole, as well as the idea that everyone could find his or her own way to serve God (Interview 1). Waldau was baptized in 1983, and after that worked with different projects within Pentecostal congregations in, for example, LaxÃ¥ and Uppsala. She worked a lot with children and teenagers, but also with music, and after some time she started to teach and evangelize. Her musical style could be described as prayers to God set to music, with some similarities to the devotional songs expressed in Neo-Pentecostal contexts. Waldau says that she met some resistance in the Pentecostal Movement. According to her, it was a problem for some that too many people came to listen to her, and that too many people asked her to come and talk. Some considered her popularity a threat, and also thought her way of speaking was too direct, meaningâaccording to herselfâher habit of being very clear about what she considered to be right and wrong, based on the Bible. When she moved to Uppsala in 1990, she started working as a childrenâs pastor. This ended in 1992, when Waldauâs husband left her for one of her best friends, resulting in a divorce. According to Waldau, the divorce prevented her from continuing as a pastor in the Pentecostal Movement in Uppsala. Additionally, she says she could not cooperate with a younger male coworker, who wanted to decide what she should do, just because she was a woman. Waldau also expresses that she was disappointed"

And we would probably consider Joeâs statement (statement 5 above) as a need for an apology. However, if we use an interactionist approach to identity as a contextual performance, we would interpret Joeâs statement concerning the apology as not necessarily âbrought to the meetingâ but as part of the situationâpotentially provoked by the altruistic comments of the other participants. So, from a phenomenological point of view, one might see Joeâs request for an apology as an expression of Joeâs inner needs whereas the interactionist approach would see Joeâs request as an expression that is at least partly a result of the context. In continuation of that perspective one could ask whether Joe would have asked for an apology if the others had expressed anger towards the offender. It is hard to eliminate the possibility that Joe might not have expressed a âneedâ for an apology if the others had behaved differently. Thus the example illustrates how the context is shaping âJoeâs selfâ."

Board members and medical superintendents were particularly outspoken in this debate, touching as it did on their anxieties about the tax base for asylums. Although the Treasury initially covered construction costs for district asylums, ratepayers were required to repay these advances, meaning that the county rates ultimately funded the system. The counties were also expected to repay the total maintenance charges for patients, which the Treasury advanced.112 Thus, when it came to patients whose maintenance came only partially from private sources, the question of who would make up the difference was fraught with tension. Several boards opposed the reception of these part-paying patients altogether, insisting that neither the state nor the local ratepayer should be obliged to subsidise them. Adopting a more moderate stance, Reverend Henry Montgomery, a member of the Belfast board, urged that only those able to pay Â£5 or Â£10 per year should be allowed to, asking âwhat are you doing with public rates but supporting the poor?â113 Despite Montgomeryâs comments, at this point the Belfast board was still refusing to accept paying patients altogether. Meanwhile, Samuel Haughton, a governor of the Carlow asylum, stated that his fellow board members were worried about the additional administrative pressure that admitting part-paying patients would create. Haughton feared it would be impossible to apportion payment according to patientsâ means, claiming that subsidising this group out of the local rates âwould be going from bad to worse, because they have not the machinery in the asylum to ascertain the truth with regard to the"

Just as the nursing care-giver wishes to be appealed to, he or she subsequently wishes every appeal to become his or her concern. The care accommodated to become nursing is concerned with that which has appealed to it. The Principle of Concern states: the nursing caregiver wishes to be concerned with that which was allowed to make the appeal. An appeal is not only noted, but also made a cause for concern. This cause for concern manifests itself in the direct volition to do something for the sake of the source of the appeal. The Principle of Volition and Practice in Nursing thus states: the nursing care-giver wishes to take practical action for the sake of the concern."

A traditional approach to ethics in organizations is that people of weak moral character are the primary cause of misbehaviour in the workplace. In the category of moral culprits at work, we find the financial advisor who sells products to a client who would have been better off reducing her debt, the dentists who deliberately either over- or undertreat their patients, and the physician who tries to coerce a patient to tattoo stubble on his cheeks. One view, then, is that these people are morally deviant and weak, lacking the personal moral fibre to withstand temptations. In the next chapter we shall see that this character approach comes under pressure from experimental studies in social and moral psychology, which indicate that circumstances have at least as much predictive power as character. The people who are guilty of wrongdoing at work can be ordinary leaders and employees, with ordinary moral standards and convictions. Experiments in this research stream gives us reasons to doubt that weak moral character is the most plausible explanation to moral misbehaviour in organizations. Rather, moral wrongdoing at work is something anyone can become involved in, if they are unfortunate with the circumstances they encounter, and the support, encouragement and critical feedback they get from colleagues in their working environment."

Undoubtedly some positive events happened in the region under his leadership, such as building and opening Northwick Park Hospital.

Sitting is now being called the ânew smokingâ, the next major health hazard that our lifestyle has developed. When we realize that we consume 30 kg of air every day, the context of sitting down indoors versus physical exercise outdoors provides interesting research opportunities and insight into the development of our health and lifestyles in general.

But coordination was only one aspect of how the government took control of IFI aid.

These patterns and processes are of deep contextual significance for our subsequent analysis of twenty-first-century Venezuela. In particular, I want to highlight three important aspects. One is the ways in which the transition from dictatorship to electoral democracy was premised upon the consolidation of a political system that centralized access to political power and the benefits of the countryâs oil revenues in the middle- and upper classes, creating a deeply socially segregated society. As we follow the unfolding of this story in the period 1960â1998, some events and trajectories that would later become of potent political, social and cultural significance in the ChÃ¡vez era are highlighted. The other aspect that I will bring attention to is the United Statesâ strong presence in the country through the oil industry, and how this influenced the ways in which consumer culture and class identities were shaped among the Venezuelan middle- and upper classes. As we will discuss more in depth later on, this dimension of Venezuelan society is important for understanding how political ideologies, social identities and national(ist) sentiments were shaped in the ChÃ¡vez era. The third aspect that I want to bring attention to is of a subtle nature, namely how Venezuelaâs formation as a state and a society is intertwined with the countryâs uneven amalgamation into global geopolitics and global capitalist markets. Amalgamation, because as an oil-exporting country it was central to the flow of black gold so vital to global capitalist development. And uneven, because as a post-colonial, semi-peripheral, oil-exporting country, its political and economic processes have been intrinsically connected to political and economic forces beyond its control. These processes have brought cycles and patterns of social and political conflict and full-blown crisis. As the country now is passing through a phase of great difficulties, I believe there is a lesson to be learned here, as well as a question to be asked: why has it been so difficult for Venezuela to find a solid economic, political and social platform for its societal development? What are the underlying causes for the countryâs continuous conflictive and contradictive search for a political future? The rest of the book will seek to provide some answers to those questions, but first we need a solid understanding of where the Venezuela of today is coming from."

The downside of this approach is that these implementations are not that eï¬cient. (For example, colSums(x) is much faster than apply(x, 2, sum).)

14,315,0.937,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"Sahra and Fatima then comment that Pernille once wore shorts to school, at which Pernille underscores that she wore tights underneath, meaning that her legs were acceptably covered. This suggests that Sahra and Fatima believe Pernille lacks the proper skills for dressing acceptably. In their view, wearing shorts to school is just not done, while tights are ok as long as they are combined with a long tunika, shirt or sweater. They also add that in general, they do not like showing much of their bodies, so they wear long sweaters, jackets, or tunics over jeans or tights. Pernille, in spite of being ethnic Norwegian, still wanted to cover up in situations where she risked comments (Rysst 2014). In other words, her gendered subject position differed according to social context; one among peers of foreign origin and another among people of unknown origins and/or ethnic Norwegians. It is worth noting that, as a 13-year-old, she preferred a style I read as hybrid rather than Norwegian. I interpret Pernilleâs choice of style, and thus gender construction, as her way of securing her friendships, particularly with Sahra. Sahra, as a Muslim, has internalized and acted according to the covering-up code. Pernille adapted to the Dal majorityâs dressing norms which probably made it easier for her to experience belonging among her best friend(s) in most of the peer contexts. Pernille is the only child in this study who explicitly expressed what I interpret as an indication of a shifting self, or variations of subject position according to context. Still, Muslim girlsâ way of dressing and behaving in family contexts versus school and peers shows the relevance of a âshifting selvesâ perspective, which I return to at the end of this subsection. Only four of the thirteen girls in the 8th grade wore headscarves. However, the majority of the girls wore very modest clothing, concealing rather than revealing the shapes of their bodies. Only three girlsâMelek of Turkish origin, Nasreen of Pakistani origin, and Helen of Thai originâadopted mainstream Western fashion, usually tight jeans with short blouses or sweaters. I am not sure if Malek or Nasreen wore more traditional clothing proscribed for Muslim girls within their familial context. We discussed the clothing styles of the other girls in the studentsâ class, and thus gained insight into how the girls felt they presented themselves. The thirteen-year-olds, Sahra, Pernille, and Fatima agreed that there existed an âethnic-religious style.â This included the hijabs and long traditional skirts typical of Somali girls. They also mentioned the three girls in their class who sport the âNorwegian styleâ of tight jeans with shorter sweaters. Sahra, Pernille, and Fatima, however, are somewhere in between these two. They are bricoleurs, or navigators of culture. In line with this, I interpret them as constructing a hybrid gendered ethnic identity, which represents the third feminine position in their peer culture. By positioning themselves in this way, they managed to ï¬t in among Muslims expecting them to hide their bodies, and among Norwegians, because these girls bought their clothes in the same shops as Norwegians. The only difference was that they more often bought longer tops to cover their bottoms if they wore tight jeans,"

For several respondents, scholars need to be trained within a well-contained field with its own standards and methodologies. Put simply, their concern was that too much pressure for interdisciplinary research causes scholars to become amateurs. In some responses the solution seemed to be to let scholars master their discipline before they reach out to others. This point was made by 19 respondents, As6, As10, Au4, E2, E9, E14, LA2, LA4, ME3, ME4, NA1, NA3, NA4, NA14, NA16, R5 and: R1: I think that the most important disadvantage of the interdisciplinary research is that there is a risk of remaining an amateur and missing some important nuances of some of the disciplines involved. E8: There is an increasing threat to monodisciplinary research. People need to be deeply trained within a single discipline; there is a need for rigour. In the past rigour was exclusive, e.g. in Celtic studies medievalism was considered top of the tree. But there is a need to have intensive monodisciplinary training and then branch out. 2. Interdisciplinary work can be extremely time-consuming, starting from the basic information exchange needed at the outset, and then involving possibly years of hard work, often for an uncertain outcome. This point was made by 7 respondents, As8, E1, E10, E12, E14, NA8, NA15, R9 and: Af3: [interdisciplinary work] is difficult to carry out because it brings much greater complexity. It also requires that people from different disciplines work together and this isnât always easy. The advantage of monodisciplinary work by contrast is that it is much easier to carry out, involving a single perspective on an issue. It is important to consider these objections in the light of distinctions between different ways of being interdisciplinary. If what is at issue is interdisciplinarity in the strong sense of A3 above, the first criticism has considerable force. But it has much less force against A1 and A2. Multidisciplinarity seems to get round the objection that the whole point is to allow scholars to remain masters in their field while still working with other experts from other fields on a collaborative project.

Drawing attention to the few systematic studies on problem posing performed until then, Kilpatrick contributes deï¬ning some aspects that required studying and investigating as steps prior to a theoretical building, though he warns, âattempts to teach problem-formulating skills, of course, need not await a theoryâ (p. 124). Kilpatrick refers to the âSource of problemsâ and points out how virtually all problems students solve have been posed by another person; however, in real life âmany problems, if not most, must be created or discovered by the solver, who gives the problem an initial formulationâ (p. 124).

Max also focused on how being home alone has impacted his relationship with his daughter. When we ask if it would have been the same if he had not been home alone, he talked about how nice it was to feel that she was dependent on him and to show her that he was a care person for her. An illustration of this bonding was that his daughter no longer automatically reached out for her mother when she was crying and needed comforting: âYes, like suddenly it was â¦ she wasnât interested in her mother when she came home from work, and her mother was almost in tears. So then it was like â¦ itâs so nice.â These stories illustrate that the fathers staying home alone for a long period of time developed a need-oriented care (Bungum, 2013).

He has taken more of the parental leave than the fatherâs quota (and because of that caused a few raised eyebrows at his work place), and had wanted even more. But Pia insisted on taking eight months so that she could nurse the children at least for the six months recommended by the health authorities. This has been the only disagreement between them. She thinks that the feminist agenda sometimes is too inflexible: âI donât know if I think itâs a great step forwards for the Womenâs Movement that mothers carry breast pumps in their lunch breaks â¦ thereâs a lot of closeted nursing at night.â But it was great to have a stay-at-home husband when she went back to work, because she felt it was so safe. Pia, who had quite a negative relationship with her father, seems to have identified consciously with her motherâs skills and career, but also unconsciously with her submissiveness to dominant men. The positive part of the identification made her quite consciously go for another type of man and she is aware that this choice is what has made it possible for her to pursue the gender-equality values she has been a firm supporter of since she was 18. âI have won the biggest prize in my husbandâ, she says with a happy smile. But had he been âa climberâ, she is sure that she would have lost the battleâthat is a lesson she takes from friends whose husbands are in high-powered jobs in the private sector. Hildeâs experiences confirm this. Her husband has a career in the private sector, whereas she holds a PhD and works in the public sector. She was also one of the radical girls at 18 with regard to gender equality. Like Tonje and Pia, she criticised her parentsâ work division, in spite of it being actually quite equal. At 30 she postponed having children, as she was aware of the âgender trapâ, not least since her husband comes from a culture that is quite distant from Nordic ideas of gender equality. At 40 they have two children and she describes a sort of backlash in her own generation, not so much because of her husbandâs cultural roots, but because of his job. She now acknowledges that her parents shared much more equally than she and her husband are able to. He is exhausted when he comes home after long workdays, and even though she understands this, she insisted that he hired a cleaner to do his share.

Let BasicGoal am be the set of all propositions of Goal am that represent the very basic attempts of the agent a at a moment m. Two non empty sets BasicGoal am and BasicGoalsbm are disjoint when their agents a and b are different. All our attempts at a moment are related by the relation of being means to achieve our goals at that very moment. Our few basic attempts at each moment are therefore primary in a double sense. First, they are not effects of other attempts. Second, they all together cause all our other attempts because they are made for that purpose. As philosophers pointed out, human agents act intentionally and especially they form their attitudes and they make their attempts for certain practical reasons, because they have then certain beliefs, desires, intentions and objectives and also because of simultaneous and sometimes anterior actions, illocutions and attitudes. They have cognitive attitudes and believe propositions for theoretical reasons. Their actions and attitudes are often motivated by several reasons. They keep a previous promise not only because they have put themselves under the obligation to keep it but also in order to please the hearer and get a favour. They suppose or believe that a proposition is true because of their previous experience and of background or social knowledge. However they would not make their attempts and they would not have their cognitive attitudes if they had no practical and no theoretical reasons at all. Indeed their practical and theoretical reasons are the very intentional causes of their attempts and cognitive attitudes. For each agent a and moment m let Reasonsam be the set of propositions representing all theoretical and practical reasons of that agent at that moment according to a model. Each agent has of course the same practical reasons to make his or her attempts at each moment compatible with his or her actions. Among the practical causes of any attempt there is the agentâs conscious intention to make that attempt. There are also his or her basic attempts that cause at that moment all his or her other attempts. BasicGoal am â Reasonsam . As I said earlier, agents succeed in performing attempted actions, when they make good attempts in right circumstances. It remains to explicate fully the notion of success. As Davidson and Searle pointed out, in order that an agent succeeds in bringing about a fact, it is not enough that he or she tries and that the fact occurs. The attempted fact must be caused by his or her own attempt. Otherwise, the agent failed. Sometimes the agentâs attempt is the cause why the attempted fact occurs. Often however there is causal overdetermination. This happens when several agents bring about the attempted fact, or when the agent brings about the fact because of several simultaneous attempts. In such cases the agentâs attempt under consideration is just a practical reason among others why the attempted fact occurred. One cannot then assert counterfactually that if the agent had not made that particular attempt, the fact would not have occurred. Like illocutionary logic, the logic of action must consider agentsâ practical reasons in order to explicate intentional causation and satisfaction-conditions of attempts. Attempts like commissive and directive illocutions have the things-to-mind direction of fit. In order that an agent succeeds in achieving an objective, his or her attempt must be a practical reason of his or her success. However the logic of action has to consider other causes than agentsâ practical reasons in order to explicate success. As Goldman pointed out, certain attempt tokens"

249,233,0.937,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"The fundamental opposition between realism and anti-realism concerns therefore, according to Dummett, the key notion of the theory of meaning, i.e. the notion in terms of which the meaning of the statements of the given class is to be explained: truth according to the realist, evidence according to the anti-realist. However, since Dummett holds that meaning is to be explained in any case in terms of truth-conditions, and that for the anti-realist truth can consist only in the existence of evidence, the realism/anti-realism opposition, in the final version he offers, concerns the notion of truth to be used in explaining meaning: the bivalent notion according to the realist, some non-bivalent notion according to the anti-realist.6 The criterion of realism is therefore, in Dummettâs opinion, the acceptance/refusal of the bivalence principle concerning truth. Notice that this raises immediately a question: if we are ready to oppose the realistic, bivalent, notion of truth with other, non-bivalent, notions, we must ask at which conditions a notion can be considered as a notion of truth. I shall return to this question later. For the time being let me observe that the story of the semantic characterization of the realism/anti-realism debate is not finished. After Dummett it has been observed that all the anti-realistic notions of truth on the market (truth as assertibility, truth as existence of a verification, and so on) share a general characteristic: that truth is an epistemic notion, and therefore is essentially knowable. Knowability has therefore been identified as the essential property of truth, and anti-realism has been characterized as the view that every truth is knowable. It is precisely this feature of anti-realistic truth that the paradox is intended to hit. In this paper I shall first argue that an intuitionistic solution to the paradox is available; then I shall examine the position of neo-verificationism concerning the paradox; finally I shall briefly consider the general question of how a rational discussion of alternative logics is possible at all."

This is possible because they have internalized the system so thoroughly that they are able to mentally simulate it as a dynamic ï¬eld of potential, enabling them to engage in âwhat-ifâ interactions of an exploratory, conversational form. In mathematics, this ability is particularly powerful, because of the dependence on representations that we have described above. We will describe several classes of technology environments that provide dynamic and/or socially-distributed interfaces with important representational systems in mathematics. These environments offer the potential for learners (even very young learners) to enter into a relationship with those systems, which we describe as co-action. We argue that the experience of relationships of co-action with mathematical structures can contribute to a transformative educational program. Of course, we do not argue that a technology that opens a possibility for co-action is sufï¬cient in itself to give learners access to mathematical understandings that were the hard-won rewards of a lifetime of study for mathematicians of the past. However, we do suggest that carefully planned educational experiences with such environments can remove barriers to broader participation in a culture of mathematical literacy and fluency. Extreme care is necessary here, as the long history of teaching and learning with static representations should not be ignored in the work to envision its future successor. Instead, we must proceed by pondering how digital and socially distributed representations of mathematical entities can contribute in new ways to genuine mathematical understanding. We see digital and shared representations as capable of adding dimensions to static representational systems and further improving the cycle of: exploration, conjecture, explanation, and justiï¬cation. Moreover, as educational systems incorporate such environments and experiences, traditional pathways of learningâwill gradually give way to new cultural and institutional structures that realize the potential of these innovations. In the sections below, we give two brief examples of co-action, one emphasizing dynamic representations, and the other highlighting socially distributed representations."

180,126,0.937,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"One final crosscutting issue lurks behind all the cases in the resource allocation chapter (perhaps all the cases in the volume)ânamely, the nature of the decisionmaking process that addresses the issues they raise. Public health decisions about resource allocationâjudging from the cases on that topic in this volumeâface reasonable ethical disagreement. That is because the tradeoffs involved in the two main goals of public health policyâimproving population health and distributing health fairlyâare trade-offs about which people often reasonably disagree. How can public health decisions be made in real time, given these ethical disagreements, in ways that enhance their legitimacy and are arguably fair to all parties? One approach to the problem is to construct a fair process for making those decisions and to rely on the outcomes of such a process. People will judge the outcomes of a fair process to be fair (Daniels and Sabin 2008). What conditions should such a decisionmaking process meet if it is to be considered fair? Four conditions are arguably necessary (even if some may think they are not sufficient and want to add others): (1) The decisions and the rationales for them should be made public. (2) They should be based on reasons all think are relevant. (3) They should be revisable in light of new evidence and arguments. And (4), these conditions should be enforced so that the public can see that they obtain. Some explanation is needed for these conditions. The publicity condition is widely embraced, even if it is fairly strong. It calls for the grounds for decisionsânot just the content of the decisionsâto be transparent. People have a right to know why decisions that affect their health are made the way they are. Moreover, making the reasoning for such decisions public is a way of exposing them to scrutiny so errors in reasoning or evidence can be detected and decisions improved. Even though we may not be able to be explicit in advance about all criteria we use to decide such cases, that is, we may work out our reasons through deliberation, we can explain on what we base our decisions. And that gives people affected by our decisions the knowledge they have a right to possess. The search for reasons that all consider relevant to making a reasonable public health decision about resource allocation can narrow disagreement considerably. Even if people can agree on what reasons they think are relevantâin the spirit of finding mutually justifiable grounds for their decisionsâthey may not agree about the weight they give these reasons. One way to test the relevance of such reasons is to subject them to scrutiny by an appropriate range of stakeholders. What counts as appropriate may vary with the case. Who should be heard in deliberations is itself worthy of deliberation. Stakeholders raise different arguments that should be heard, and including their voices improves buy-in to decisions. Since stakeholders may not in many instances be elected representatives, we may be skeptical about whether the democratic process is improved by including them, but, if the deliberation is well managed, the quality of the discussion may improve greatly. The revisability condition, requiring that decisions be modifiable in light of new evidence and argument, is also widely embraced and not considered controversial. Decisions are made on the basis of evidence and arguments, and better evidence and"

360,154,0.937,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"One presumes that lexical verbs also correspond to mental concepts in this overall picture, and that since verb phrases can conjoin (eats, drinks, and falls asleep as well as marries, works, breeds, and dies); so presumably the corresponding verboriented concepts can conjoin. But as I will try to demonstrate in this section, it seems reasonable to suppose it will be a different type of concept combination than in the nominal side of things, because of the particular differences there are between the noun-concepts and the verb-concepts, as well as the higher degree of complexity that verb-concepts display. Conceptual combination seems to have been designed to deal with what might be called âconjunctive (or: intersective) conceptsâ, even though the resulting feature lists (or whatever used to keep track of properties) is not a simple conjunction of the feature lists of the subparts. A part of the rationale for concentrating on this could be that English allows easily for conjoined noun phrases (Bob and Sally, Men and women, Both small dogs and short snakes, All baseball players but only some Olympic high-jumpers, etc.) And also that the interpretation of adjective-noun combinations has historically been seen as conjunctive (although modern formal semantics treats them otherwise). But it is not so clear to me how any similar technique will work with what might be called âdisjunctive conceptsâ. After all, English pretty easily allows for disjunctive noun phrases: Juan or Alice, Men or women, Either Americans or Canadians, etc.48 As remarked just above, verb phrases easily conjoin just as much as noun phrases do, but I claimed that the conceptual items corresponding to verbal items will require some different sort of combining method from the ones in the noun realm. Verb phrases can disjoin, like noun phrases can, for linguistic phrases such as is either swimming or eating. Another place where noun concepts and verb concepts appear to be different is in the case of linguistic conjunction. But given that the conceptual combining method for verb-concepts is different from that of noun-concepts, due to the inherently more complex nature of verbs, it seems likely that the method for forming disjunctive verb-concepts would have to be different from that of forming disjunctive noun-concepts. A special difficulty for theories of concepts attends to those concepts that correspond to non-monadic verbs. That is, to relational verbsâones that take direct and indirect objects.) For example, the verb kick requires a direct object, and so any corresponding concept will require something corresponding to this. As with any verb-concept, there will need to be some notion of a subject of the kicking-concept. But in the case of transitive verbs, the corresponding concept will also require the notion of a recipient of the kicking. It seems that some as-yet unspecified notion of conceptual combination is required for this. (And a further unspecified one for"

What if human beings had only four fingers on each hand, like cartoon characters? We probably never would have thought to develop a number system based on ten. Instead, we would have considered it normal and natural and sensible and inevitable and incontrovertible and undeniably proper to base our number system on eight. This is called an octal number system, or base eight. If our number system were organized around eight rather than ten, we wouldnât need the symbol that looks like this:"
186,14,0.937,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"It is difï¬cult to write about dignity. Few other terms have been used in so many settings with so many contradictory meanings. On the one hand, it is proclaimed that dignity1 can never be lost. âDignity is inviolableâ is the ï¬rst sentence of the German constitution, to give an example. On the other hand, movements around the world declare that they are on a mission to acquire dignity for their constituencies. From Syrian refugee girls (UNICEF 2015) to government commissions investigating the neglect and abuse of elderly residents in care homes (Age UK n.d.), politicians and activists have used the term to support their quests. Swiss philosopher and novelist Peter Bieri (also known as Pascal Mercier) captured some of the mysteries of the term âdignityâ in his novel Night Train to Lisbon. The novel sees middle-aged teacher Gregorius abandon his post and travel to Lisbon. There he meets a former resistance ï¬ghter, JoÃ£o EÃ§a, who lives in a"

When JoÃ£o EÃ§a stood in the door of his room â¦ on Sunday, Gregorius saw in his face that something had happened. EÃ§a hesitated before asking him in. It was a cold March day, yet the window was wide open.â¦ EÃ§a moved the pawns. âI went in bed last night,â he said in a rough voice. âAnd I didnât notice it.â He kept his eyes lowered to the board.â¦ Gregorius made tea and poured him half a cup. EÃ§a saw the look that fell on his shaking hands. âA dignidade,â he said. âDignity,â said Gregorius. âI have no idea what that really is. But I donât think itâs something that gets lost just because the body fails.â EÃ§a botched the opening. âWhen they led me to torture, I went in my pants and they laughed at it. It was a horrible humiliation; but I didnât feel I was losing my dignity. But what is it then?â Did he believe he would lose his dignity if he had talked, asked Gregorius. âI didnât say a word, not a single word. I locked away all the possible words in me. Yes, thatâs it: I locked them away and bolted the door irrevocably. So it was impossible for me to talk. â¦ I stopped acknowledging the torturers as actors. They didnât know it, but I degraded them. â¦â And if they had loosened his tongue with a drug? He had often asked himself that, said EÃ§a, and he had dreamed of it. He had come to the conclusion that they could have destroyed him with that, but they could never take away his dignity in this way. To lose your dignity, you had to forfeit yourself. âAnd then you get worked up about a dirtied bed?â said Gregorius and shut the window. âItâs cold and it doesnât smell, not at all.â (Mercier 2009: 364â365)"
13,398,0.937,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"class boys, who, being located in the middle-class and girl-dominated sphere of academic high school, may have an unconscious wish to defend their fathersâ status by denigrating feminine activities. The predominant pattern, however, is that the positive identification with their fathersâ masculinity does not exclude identifications with more âfeminineâ values and activities. It is a question to what extent they gender these qualities at all: what it means to be a man may include all sorts of qualities regardsless of whether they have been culturally associated with masculinity or femininity earlier. It resembles what Lynne Layton describes thus: âThe capacity to enjoy being a man without repudiating identifications with women seems to lead to something new, something that is not dominant in the culture and that the term androgyny does not quite captureâ (1998: 189). Masculine gender identity in this generation, especially among middle-class boys, is rather connected to the feeling of being unique and unpredictable than to a specific cultural content."
