Appearance of the centroids was very similar as in the single camera experiment. This is probably due to the fact that the information in the crops from cameras 1 and 2 do not significantly differ in most cases. Together 23 frequent episodes were found on layer 1 (20 of length 1 (cluster index) and 3 of length 2). Based on this the output vector had 23 elements.

Screening for loss of heterozygosity was first performed with putative doubled haploid plants (panel a). Lanes 1 and 2 are parents. Lane 3 represents a synthetic F1 hybrid created by mixing equal amounts of genomic DNA from each parent. Two cleavage products are produced indicating heterozygosity in the F1 (marked by arrows). Lanes 4â14 represent putative DH plants. Experiments were then performed to determine the parental origin of the allele in putative DH plants. Panel b shows mixtures of samples with parent 1 (lane 1 of panel a). The first lane of panel b is the positive control. Lanes 2â12 are putative DH plants mixed with parent 1. This shows that two plants (lanes 7 and 12) inherited the allele from parent 2, while all others inherited the allele from parent 1.

This chapter deï¬ned the predicting point of rock failure as from 22 h 00 until 24 h 00 on September 11st, 2009. When MS events entered a relatively quiet period accompanied by a CAV surge from 0 h 00 until 4 h 00 on September 13rd, 2009, this point was interpreted as a key predicting point. At 0 h 00 on September 14th, 2009, roadway collapse accidents occurred in mine road 2, slice 6, sublevel 1369, level 1331 m (argillaceous limestone, approximately 100 t), and the activity rate of MS events and CAV of seismic source simultaneously increased sharply, as shown in Fig. 9.5. Rock failure was located with MS monitoring system in Fig. 9.6, and occurred in ï¬eld in Fig. 9.7. The results showed that stress entered the predicting point of rockburst with the sharp increase in the activity of MS events and CAV. With increasing stress, the beginning of quiet period of MS events was the predicting key point of rockburst. After the quiet period, MS events were active and CAV increased sharply, rockburst occurred. It should be noted that the relationship between rockmass failure and a decrease in MS event activity rate or increase in the CAV was an unnecessary but sufï¬cient condition. The decreased AE events might be the stage of original crack compaction, so rockburst might not occur after predicting. Therefore, not all decreased"
49,80,0.929,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"It is difficult to evaluate the results of unsupervised learning. In this case the emphasis is on consistency of results on the training and on the testing set. This means that when operator assigns a name to certain outputs these outputs will become active for the same objects in the training and in the testing set. In the single camera experiment together 40 frequent episodes were found on layer 0 (11 of length 2 - not used, 7 of length 3, 12 of length 4 and 10 of length 5). The sequences may be visualized as e.g. the sequence of appropriately post-processed cluster centroids. In the ideal case the centroids would represent different elementary shapes. Without Gabor filtering the centroids in our case were relatively uniform patches of various luminance meaning the changes in luminance are more important rather than changes of texture. That also means that changes in exposure would influence the behavior of the system negatively. Appropriate data preprocessing is needed to achieve robustness. Together 24 frequent episodes were found on layer 1 (20 of length 1 (cluster index), 3 of length 2 and 1 of length 3). Based on this the output vector had 24 elements.

The first subchain could have VNFs with optional order, so a good planning of such functions in the final VNF-FG would impact the entire network performance. The second scenario (VNFR 2) follows the structure of a service chain used to split service paths where service providers enable content awareness. VNF 1 splits the traffic into two sub-flows through two outgoing links. On the one hand VNF 2 is disposed at the sub-flow of VNF 1 to process 60% of its outgoing traffic; on the other hand, VNF 3 is located at the second sub-flow of VNF 1 to process 40% of its outgoing traffic. VNF 4 has to be processed by both sub-flows and, subsequently, the final function of the VNFR is VNF 5. Finally, VFNR 3 is given for scenarios in the Gi Interface for mobile network environments. We define an scenario with seven VNFs disposed as follows: VNF 1 is the initial function to be performed, this function divides the incoming traffic into three sub-flows through three links with relative bandwidth demands of 20%, 40% and 40% respectively. VNF 2 depends on the first sub-flow while VNFs 3 and 4 depend on the second sub-flow and VNFs 5 and VNF 6 depend on the last sub-flow.

118,166,0.928,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Let us now return to Fig. 4.3. The surface concentration is shown in units of Bq/m2, or the number of atoms decayed per second per square meter. For example, the red-colored region is contaminated at a concentration of â3,000 kBq/m2 or greater,â which means more than 3 million becquerels per square meter. As will be explained later (also shown in Chap. 3 of this volume), half of this contamination is due to Cs-134. So if the surface concentration at a location of interest is 3 million becquerels per square meter (Bq/m2), then 1.5 million becquerels of Cs-134 exists per square meter at that location. To express this level of contamination in terms of mass (grams) rather than radioactivity (becquerels), we can divide the number of becquerels just calculated (1.5 million per square meter) by the number of atoms decayed per second, as calculated in the preceding paragraph (4.8 Ã 1013), as follows: 1.5 Ã 106/4.8 Ã 1013 = 0.031 Ã 10â6 g/m2, or 0.031 Âµg/ m2. In other words, in Fig. 4.3, the Cs-134 contamination of the red-colored region is about three-hundredths of a microgram of Cs-134 spread over the area of 1 m2."
258,160,0.928,New Horizons for Asian Museums and Museology,"Before the power-saving regime (normal regime), the general storage rooms were air-conditioned daily between 08:20 and 18:00. The temperature was set at 26 Â± 2 Â°C in summer and at 20 Â± 2 Â°C in winter, varying 0.5 Â°C per week in the transitional periods, while RH was set at 52 Â± 5 % all the year. The power-saving regime was adopted for general storage rooms. Under the power-saving regime, the airconditioning was turned off during the transitional periods. During the winter of 2011, air-conditioning was run only at night during the off-peak period. In summer 2012, air-conditioning was only run for 24 h, 2 days a week (Table 2). However, one of the general storage rooms (Room No. 5) was exempted from these power-saving measures as it was situated in upstairs and not surrounded by other rooms. Consequently this room is easily exposed to the effects of outside air. The results of temperature and humidity control under the normal regime and the power-saving regime were examined and compared based on actual readings (Sonoda and Hidaka 2013). â¢ For the transition periods, temperature changes occurred more gradually with the suspension of air-condition under the power-saving regime than under the normal regime, resulting in smaller ï¬uctuations in temperature and in RH. â¢ Under the normal regime, the average temperature remained within the control range in all of the storage rooms, whereas it tended to drop below the control range under the power-saving regime. The maximum daily difference between the lowest and the highest temperature readings was less than 4 Â°C (even less than 2 Â°C in several rooms) under both regimes, except in Room No.5. The average daily difference was around 2 Â°C or less (even less than 0.5 Â°C in several rooms) under both regimes, except in Room No.5."

Suppose the two desired within-year yields are to be 3 and 0 for periods 1 and 2, respectively. The total annual yield, Y0.9, is 3. Assuming the natural distribution of this annual yield of 3 in period 1 is 0.25 Y0.9 = 0.75, and in period 2 it is 0.75 Y0.9 = 2.25, the within-year storage required to redistribute these yields of 0.75 and 2.25 to become 3 and 0, respectively, is Kwa = 2.25. From Tables 11.2 or 11.3 we can see that an annual yield of 3 requires an over-year storage capacity of 3. Thus, the estimated total storage capacity required to provide yields of 3 and 0 in periods 1 and 2 is the over-year capacity of 3 plus the within-year capacity of 2.25 equaling 5.25. This compares with 3 plus 2.5 of actual within-year capacity required for a total of 5.50, as indicated in Table 11.3. There are ways to reduce the number of over-year constraints without changing the solution of the over-year model. Sequences of years whose annual inflow values equal or exceed the desired annual yield can be combined into one constraint. If the yield is an unknown variable then the mean annual inflow can be used as the desired annual yield since it is the upper limit of the annual yield. For example in Table 11.2 note that the last three years and the ï¬rst year have flows equal or greater than 4, the mean annual inflow. Thus, these four successive years can be combined into a single continuity equation S7 Ã¾ Q7 Ã¾ Q8 Ã¾ Q9 Ã¾ Q1"

The remanufacture of a Jaguar XJ6 engine necessitated 120 h of labour and new parts of a total weight of 20 kg; the labour-input per weight ratio of 6 man-hour/kg material input is 240 times that of manufacturing a new car engine (pp. 198/9). The Eiffel Tower in Paris is completely repainted every 7 years; 25 painters spend more than 12 months to apply 60 tonnes of paint on 250,000 m2 of iron elements; the labour input per weight ratio is 0.7 man-hours per kg (p. 191). The remanufacture of the gearbox of a Lorry needs 59 h of manpower if parts are individually repaired, at a cost of CHF 10,400; or 23.5 h at a cost of CHF 16,000 if damaged parts are replaced by new ones.

The IEEE 802.11p is a well known technology since it is designed to cope the frequent topology changing in IVC. During 200 s of simulation time, each vehicle is expected to run under and on the overpass in the ï¬rst case, and on the different road level in the second case. S, R, and I are placed randomly both on two different road levels and SUMO [20] is used to generate the realistic mobility of each vehicle. Moreover, the number of S and R are generated equally, which means a 10-vehicle network contains of 5 senders and 5 receivers. The simulation area covers an environment which involves crossing and parallel overpass scenarios (c.f. Fig. 1) in order to show many cases in three-dimensional area. In previous works, these two algorithms have not been evaluated over various packet sizes, thus, the packet size for the ï¬rst evaluation is varied from 1â10 kB, especially for non-safety applications: a half page of unformatted email is 1 kB, one typical HTML webpage is 30 kB, 1 min of near-CD quality audio as MP3 or a 2048  1536 (4 megapixel) JPEG photo is 1 MB, to evaluate the size of packet that can be successfully transmitted in two algorithms. However, this simulation focuses only on transmitting email, with the size of the packet from 1 to 10 kB. The ï¬rst result (cf. Fig. 6) shows the PDR of all algorithms when different packet sizes are applied. This performed evaluation simulates 40 vehicles that move with an average speed of 40 km/h. The V2VUNet area restriction algorithm gives 20% better PDR compared to the greedy forwarding scheme which in the ï¬gure is indicated as No V2VUNet. V2VUNet area restriction also shows 10% better compared to V2VUNet-path prediction scheme. The showed PDR in overall algorithms decreases as the packet size increases, which indicates that more participating vehicles and simulation time are required to successfully complete the packet forwarding mechanism. V2VUNet indicates that HRA and VRA weight values have signiï¬cant impacts in packet transmission. Table 2.

Although the number of datasets in the distribution is quite small (36) we may, with good will, observe an approximation to a Bradford distribution for the searched records: the first tertile (69,207 records) of the total number of records (207,622) is covered by the top-2 1/2 datasets alone (sorted by Record Number = 79,273 records). The next 6 1/2 datasets cover 74,086 records, approximating the second tertile. The remaining 27 datasets cover the last tertile. This approximates to a = 2.5 datasets; a n = 2.5 Ã 3 (= 7 1/2 datasets) and a n2 = 2.5 Ã 9 (= 22 1/2 datasets). A Bradford distribution for a given range of datasets implies that very few datasets (2â3) cover a large portion (> 33 %) of the entire volume of records in the area covered by the range of datasets (here defined by the provider), followed by a long tail phenomenon. In fact, the pattern shown is steeper than suggested by a standard Bradford distribution. More than 2/3 of the searched records in the DanBIF biodiversity collection (142,000 records) were covered by only 7 datasets (20 %), Fig. 3, right-hand side. From Table 1 we observe that of the top-10 datasets ranked according to search events (popularity) seven datasets were also those sets with most used records as searched and viewed by peer biodiversity researchers world-wide. The pattern can be monitored over time for consistency, see example Table 2 for the HUA provider. During the monitored month in 2009 the DOF dataset was the most used set according to Searched Records but ranked fifth with respect to Searching Event frequency, i.e. popularity. In addition the DOF dataset had the highest Search Density (105.5 records per search event).

362,437,0.922,Cloud-Based Benchmarking of Medical Image Analysis,"13.3 Results Only one run was submitted for the VISCERAL Retrieval benchmark 2015, which combined both the RadlexID weighting score scheme and the visual texture features. This run contained a ranking of 300 cases for each of the ten query topics in the benchmark. The cases were ranked in descending order according to the computed similarity to the query topic. The proposed approach obtained the highest mean average precision (MAP) scores in 6 out of the 10 query topics [11]. The topic with the highest MAP was topic 08â kidney cystâwith 0.5131, and the lowest was topic 10ârib fractureâwith 0.0467. The mean MAP was 0.2367 which was the second best MAP score of the benchmark. Although the precision from 10 (P_10), 20 (P_20) and 30 (P_30) documents retrieved is lower than the method by Spanier et al. [20], our method presented a more stable decline of precision scores obtaining the benchmark top scores for 100 (P_100) and 200 (P_200) documents retrieved (see Fig. 13.5). Moreover, the proposed method obtained the highest total of relevant documents retrieved (num_rel_ret): 1077 out of a maximum of 2462. In 7 of the 10 query topics, it obtained the top number of total documents retrieved out of all the different 21 runs in the benchmark (see Fig. 13.6). The mean average precision (MAP), precision after query relevant cases retrieved (Rprec), binary preference (bpref), precision after 10 cases retrieved (P_10) and precision after 30 cases retrieved (P_30) from our method are shown per query topic in Table 13.1. These results take special interest when compared against the other retrieval methods proposed in order to identify which components receive a particular benefit when a multimodal-based scoring is introduced. There is a clear advantage of the method by Spanier et al. in query topic 10 when compared to our method. This topic, with radiological diagnosis of rib fracture, had only 47 cases"

The possible major release during the hydrogen explosion of Unit 3 at 11:00 JST on 14 March could not be estimated because the plume flowed to the Pacific Ocean on the northwesterly wind. Thus, the same value of release rate estimated for the hydrogen explosion of Unit 1 (i.e., 3.0 Ã 1015 Bq hâ1) was assumed for this period. For other time periods before 21:30 JST on 14 March, estimated release rates of 131I had values between 1.7 Ã 1013 and 8.4 Ã 1013 Bq hâ1, which were similar to our preliminary estimated values. The spatial pattern of surface deposition of 137Cs and increases in air dose rates observed at the monitoring posts around FNPP1 were generally reproduced by WSPEEDI using the estimated release rates. The simulation results indicate that the amount of dry deposition of the high-concentration plume discharged during the afternoon of 12 March was clearly smaller than that of the total deposition from the afternoon to the evening of 15 March, which formed the highest dose rate zone in the northwest region of FNPP1 [21].

The potential reproductive success of A. squamatus plants was estimated by counting the number of flower heads for plants belonging to each category, as well as seed number per single flower head. The data obtained were used in making a calculated estimation of the total seed number for an individual plant. Subsequently, we tested the seeds for their germination rate in laboratory conditions. We collected ripe seeds in the field in October 2011; these were dry-stored until the beginning of the experiment. Twenty seeds were allowed to germinate untreated on filter paper, watered with distilled water for 31 days. Observations were performed every 2 days, at which point germinated seeds were counted and removed.

18,248,0.917,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"Before carrying out simulations with the calculated meteorological variables from MM5, this study conducted a series of preliminary simulations with a set of simplified meteorological conditions, that is, a uniform and constant wind field of 1 m sâ1, horizontally uniform but vertically varying vertical eddy diffusivities based on the calculated values of MM5, and prescribed intensities of uniform precipitation. The LPRM was the same as the main simulations. The purpose of these simulations is to discuss dependency of deposition and air concentration on deposition parameters. The results are shown in Figs. 14.2 and 14.3. The dependency of dry deposition on the deposition velocity is quite simple. The dry deposition rate from the plume monotonously decreases with travel time, which is the elapsed time from release, mainly from horizontal and vertical diffusion causing air concentration decreases (Fig. 14.2a). The dry deposition rate for the 0.3 mm hâ1 case is about 11.4 % of that for the 3 mm hâ1 case at the travel time of 6 h. This ratio is almost same with the ratio of deposition velocities, but slightly modified by the change in the air concentration. The concentration for the 3 mm hâ1 case is about 88 % of that of the 0.3 mm hâ1 case (Fig. 14.2b). These results imply that the dry deposition process does not significantly reduce the amount of radioactivity in air within a period of several hours. The dependency of wet deposition on the scavenging coefficient is somewhat complicated (Fig. 14.3a). A larger scavenging coefficient does not always cause greater deposition. Among the four cases, the largest scavenging coefficient, which corresponds to the rain intensity of 6.6 mm hâ1, resulted in the largest wet deposition"

All virtual CI user differs from each other in their most comfortable and threshold levels used in the map. That means that the speech processor of each virtual CI user will generate different electrodograms for the same vowels. Next, formant features were extracted from the electrodograms based on the spectral contrast between formants 1 and 2. Noise was added to the spectral contrast features (jnd noise). Three amounts of noise were added 0.01, 10 and 50 % of the magnitude of the formants extracted. Figure 2 presents the results predicted by the model in percentage of correct vowels identified for five different SCE factors (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4). From the modelling results it can be observed that maximum performance is achieved for SCE factors 2 and 4. The other interesting aspect is that there is no difference in performance across the five different virtual CI users for âNoise Factorâ 0.001 (Fig. 2a). That means that the feature extraction (i.e. the extraction of the formants) is robust to the different electrodograms of each virtual CI user.

About the number of years of Internet usage, this feature has integer values from 0 to +â. In particular, in the dataset it varies from 1 to 9. Consequently, it is discretized by employing an Equal-Width Discretization [8], obtaining 3 different ranges, named as high Internet usage (> 6 years), middle Internet usage (from 4 to 6 years), and low Internet usage (< 4 years). The features corresponding to the response time in solving the 4 different types of image-based CAPTCHA have decimal values varying from 0.0 to +â. A test has been conducted for discretization of these features with multiple methods, including Equal-Width Discretization. It demonstrated that most of the methods fail in this task because they obtain a poor discretization. On the contrary, discretization by adopting the K-Medians clustering algorithm [4], whose advantage is finding the natural groups of data based on their characteristics, performed successfully, identifying 3 different ranges. The aim of the K-Medians is to determine K ranges from the values of the features, by minimizing a function J. It measures the total sum of L1 norm between each value in a certain range and its centroid, which is its median value. We run the K-Medians algorithm 10 times with K = 3 and selected the set of ranges with the lowest value of J as the optimal solution. Hence, K-Medians found 3 ranges corresponding to low response time (< 12.34 s), middle response time (from 12.34 s to 27.30 s), and high response time (> 27.30 s).

According to this relationship, the depth of a zero age sulfide is calculated as 125 cmbsf (centimeters below the sea floor). We consider this intercept value reasonable, since the top of the massive sulfide was found at 112 cmbsf and only pumiceous materials were found in the shallowest layer by the drilling. Similarly, a slope derived from five data points for the BMS07 samples range from <100 to 1,230 years gives an estimated as 6.6 years per 1 cm (Fig. 23.3b). As discussed in the previous section, ages of sulfide mineralization should be carefully considered, as they accumulate over a period of time and not instantaneous but constantaneous. We are not confident of estimating growth rates for massive sulfide deposits by simple linear regression. However, the calculated growth rates of 0.59 mm year 1 for core BMS03 and 1.5 mm year 1 for core BMS07, respectively, would provide basic age information, when discussing the formation history of this type of mineralization. Previously, we dated a sulfide crust adjacent to an active chimney at the Archaean site, in a water depth of 2,974 m, and estimated its growth rate as 0.12 mm year 1 (Takamasa et al. 2013). These three estimates of growth rates fall within about a range of one order-of-magnitude, which we believe represent the growth rate of massive sulfide mineralization at this site. The distribution of ages for all the samples collected from the Archaean Site, including the results of the previous study, is compiled in Fig. 23.4.

84,444,0.916,Eye Tracking Methodology,"Two-Group Design The previous single factor (one experimental variable) designs are within-subjects because all participants (including the individual, naturally) are given the treatment. Extending those designs to between-subjects leads to a two-group factorial design, shown in block form in Fig. 17.2. Each group, identified by the boxes, receives either Aâ¦ or A1 , where Aâ¦ is a placebo and A1 is the treatment. Being a between-subjects design, care must be taken in assignment of participants to groups. This is accomplished via randomization, prescreening, or targeted assignment, as discussed above. Comparison of the mean response to the stimulus (A1 ) versus the mean response to the placebo (Aâ¦ ) would determine significance (or insignificance) of the treatment (i.e., its effect). Two-Factorial Consider the four boxed two-factorial design in Fig. 17.2. There are four experimental conditions, composed of a combination of two experimental variables, each administered at one of two levels. This is a 2 Ã 2 factorial design, where the 2 indicates the number of levels of each factor. What is important is how groups of participants are allocated to each condition. Several permutations are possible: â¢ If each box in the 2 Ã 2 cube is assigned a unique group of participants, this design is a 2 Ã 2 four-group, or fully independent, between-subjects (or just 2 Ã 2 between-subjects) design. â¢ If we assigned one group of participants to condition Bâ¦ (the left column) and another group to condition B1 (right column), then the design becomes a 2 Ã 2 mixed design (because it mixes within- and between-subjects). Because the same group would receive treatment Bâ¦ or B1 , repeated measures analysis would be required to test for significance between these factorial levels inasmuch as the measurements of B are no longer independent. 2 Ã 3 Factorial Design Finally, consider the 2 Ã 3 design shown at the bottom of Fig. 17.2 in yet another form of representation, where groups of participants are now made explicit with the subscripted G notation. Both are 2 Ã 3 designs because there are two levels of B and three levels of A. The design at left, however, differs because treatment A varies within-subjects. Analysis of Aâs effect, therefore, examined across rows, will require repeated measures, or nonindependent analysis across the rows of the data collected. Analysis of Bâs effect, examined across columns, however, can be performed via independent analysis methods because this treatment is administered between-subjects. In contrast, the 2 Ã 3 design at right is fully independent, or fully between-subjects."

It was reported that the committed effective doses were less than 1 mSv in the 9,497 residents (Tsubokura 2012). We confirmed that internal exposure to cesium and iodine radiation soon after TEPCOâs nuclear power plant accident was relatively low; that is, the largest effective dose was 39 Î¼Sv in the 59 dispatched KURRI volunteers. We are not aware of any published report on follow-up data of the internal exposure to cesium and iodine radiation measured with a whole-body counter in public after the early period following the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. The follow-up data of internal doses for two volunteers of the first dispatched team showed that the activity of iodine-131 was detected for 40 days in volunteer A and for 9 days in volunteer B after the last dispatch working day in Fukushima prefecture. Cesium-137 and -134 of volunteer A has been detected for 125 days and that in volunteer B for 56 days after the last dispatch working day in Fukushima. The American Nuclear Society reported the initial measurements for residents who lived in areas associated with high doses of Fukushima Prefecture. Between June 27and July 16 in 2011, the activities of cesium-134, cecium-137, and iodine-131 were measured in 122 residents by whole-body counter. Cesium-134 was detected 47.7 % and cesium-137 at 29.4 %; the highest activity was 3,100 Bq of cesium-134 and 3,800 Bq of cesium-137. Iodine-131 was not detected.

In this section, accident progression for Unit 2 is described in accordance with the following accident chronology (Table 2.3). In Unit 2, despite the fact that both AC and DC power were lost due to the tsunami, RCIC continued operation without control for almost 70 h. However, Unit 2 fell into severe accident mode because of lack of water injection. PCV venting was never successful. Hydrogen explosion had not occurred, but FPs were released to the environment. 2.4.2.1 From the Earthquake to Tsunami Arrival At Unit 2, the following operation steps were taken towards cold shutdown: startup and shutdown of the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system,10 start-up of the residual heat removal (RHR) system11 in the S/C cooling mode, etc. Unit 2 lost all power supplies due to damage by the tsunami at 15:41 on March 11. At Unit 2, as the RCIC system had been manually started up at 15:39 just before the DC power for control was lost, water injection to the reactor could continue after the tsunami arrival. This was the major difference between the situations of Unit 1 and Unit 2, i.e., at Unit 1 the IC had been shut down before the tsunami arrived, and therefore the IC could not be restarted upon loss of the control power supply, which resulted in a rapidly deteriorating situation. 10 The RCIC system is a single train standby system for safe shutdown of the plant. 11 The residual heat removal (RHR) system is typically a multiple-use system with modes of"

Further increasing the window size to 2 s, as shown in Fig. 3(c), does not provide a clear improvement of the classification accuracy. For example, although Area 1 is now classified with 100 % accuracy, the performance of the classifier for Area 2 has dropped to 68 %. By inspecting Figs. 3(a)â(c) we can observe a consistently low performance of our classifier with respect to Area 2. This can be explained if we look at the spatial distribution of beacons with respect to areas, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). We can observe that the number of beacons is less than the number of areas (four versus five respectively). Moreover, each Area can be associated with one specific beacon which is closest to it: Area 1 with Beacon 1, Area 4 with Beacon 2, Area 5 with Beacon 4 and Area 3 with Beacon 3. However, there is no one Beacon that can be associated with Area 2. The two closest beacons to Area 2 are Beacon 4 and Beacon 3.

The texture was a tone cloud consisting of a sequence of 30-ms, temporally overlapping pure tones whose frequency covered a range of 2.2 octaves (400â1840 Hz) divided in 8 frequency bins. The frequency resolution of the tone distribution was 12 semitones per octave, starting at 400 Hz. This allowed 26 tone frequencies in total with 3â4 frequency values in each frequency bin. The minimal temporal unit of the stimulus was a 30-ms chord in which the number of tones in a particular frequency range was drawn according to a marginal distribution for that frequency range. On average, for each chord duration the mean number of tones per octave was 2. The marginal distribution of occurrence probability was obtained by modifying a uniform distribution in each frequency bin. The probability in each of these is called Puniform = 18 = 0.125. To generate different initial frequency marginals, we perturbed the marginals randomly by adding/ subtracting fixed value Î corresponding to 50 % of the probability (which would be observed for a uniform distribution (Î = Puniform/2 = 0.0625)). The resulting marginal distribution was thus pseudo-random with 3 bins at Puniform + Î, 3 bins at Puniform â Î and 2 bins left intact at Puniform. This implies that the average initial probability in 2 bins can take 5 different values, namely Î, 3Î/2, 2Î, 5Î/2, and 3Î. The change consisted in an increment of the marginal distribution in the selected frequency bins at a random point in time (referred to as change time) during stimulus presentation. We chose to use an increment of the marginal distribution in two adjacent frequency bins on the basis that an appearance is more salient than its opposite in a complex acoustic stimulus (Constantino et al. 2012). After the change, the second stimulus continued for up to 2 s or until the subject made an earlier decision, whichever happened first.

The blue regions around the O ions are the most stable proton sites and are located â¼1 Ã from the O ions. The OH distance is almost equivalent to that in water, indicating that OH bond formation stabilizes the protons in BaZrO3. There are four equivalent proton sites per O ion, which are connected by the low-PE points around the O ions. The rotational path around the O ions consists of four equivalent quarter-rotational paths, where the calculated potential barrier is 0.18 eV. On the other hand, the hopping path connecting adjacent rotational orbits is located at the periphery of the edges of the ZrO6 octahedra. The calculated potential barrier of the hopping path is 0.25 eV, which is higher than that of the rotational path. The two kinds of paths form a three-dimensional proton-conducting network throughout the crystal lattice. Consequently, protons exhibit a long-range"

(2000) and then dried by flushing with N2 gas at room temperature. Sterile 250-mL glass culture flasks, each containing 100 mL of ASW and capped with sponge plugs, were used to contain the incubations. Each flask contained one of the following systems: ASW with slabs and an inoculum; ASW with only slabs; ASW with only an inoculum; only ASW. The contents of all systems were prepared in duplicate, except for the system of only ASW. The inoculum was prepared from a slurry of the mostly oxidized surface of the SMS sample. The cell density of the slurry was 3.62  0.65  107 cells mL 1 (corresponding to 2.22  0.38  106 cells (g sulfide) 1) determined by fluorescence microscopy (Kato et al. 2009a). The systems containing slabs and an inoculum are denoted as MC1 and MC2; those with only slabs as C1 and C2; those with only an inoculum as M1 and M2; and the negative control, without slabs and an inoculum as N (i.e., blank test), respectively. MC1, MC2, C1 and C2 each contained 10 slabs. One milliliter of the slurry was added into each of MC1, MC2, M1 and M2. These reaction systems were incubated in a cold room at 4  C. An aliquot of 3 mL (1 mL for direct cell counting and 2 mL for chemical analyses) was removed from each culture with a sterile disposable syringe at 4, 42, 140, 332, 782, and 1698 h after the start of the experiment. Before sampling, each medium was gently withdrawn and returned by action of a sterile disposable syringe three times. To determine the number of cells, each sample was filtered through a black polycarbonate filter (pore size, 0.2 Î¼m; diameter, 13 mm; Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). Each filter was washed twice with ultra-pure water, and then was dried in a sterilized Petri dish and stored at 20  C. For the chemical analyses, each sample was filtered through a polycarbonate filter (pore size, 0.2 Î¼m; diameter, 25 mm; Advantec, Tokyo, Japan), and the filtrates were individually stored in an acid-cleaned 2-mL polypropylene tube. Approximately 300 Î¼L of each filtrate was used for the pH measurement. At the end of the incubations, a 60 mL aliquots of each solution was filtered through a polycarbonate filter (pore size, 0.2 Î¼m; diameter, 13 mm; Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). The filters were stored at 80  C prior to DNA analysis. To remove the microbes that were loosely attached to the slabs, the slabs were gently swished in sterilized Petri dishes containing 30 mL of ultra-pure water with tweezers. The water was replaced three times. Five slabs from each experiment were stored at 80  C for DNA analysis, and the other five slabs were fixed with 3.7 % (w/v) formalin at 4  C over night and then stored in a 1:1 ethanol/phosphatebuffered saline mixture at 20  C until microscopy was performed."

The adjusting parameter to increase the fissile amount was the zirconium content in TRU-Zr alloy fuel to keep k-effective Â¼ 1.0 at the end of the cycle. Table 15.2 shows the summary of the analysis results. The reduction of the core height from 93 cm to 65 cm resulted in a 12 % decrease of burn-up reactivity swing. The introduction of a B4C shield, where natural boron was assumed, at the core periphery region resulted in only about a 5 % decrease in burn-up reactivity swing. On the other hand, the penalty of this countermeasure is the increase of core power peaking because the leakage of neutrons from the core surface increases. Hence, this measure was not adopted in the subsequent core design. Regarding the effect of the number of refueling batches, the larger is the number of refueling batches, the smaller the burn-up reactivity swing becomes. The effect was approximately a 5 % decrease in burnup reactivity swing for a 40 % increase in the number of refueling batches. This measure was not adopted in the subsequent core design because its effect on the burn-up reactivity swing is small and it leads to significant increase of core power peaking because of the increased difference of burn-up between most burnt fuel and fresh fuel."

A significantly higher incidence of major and/or CRNM bleeding was seen in the twicedaily edoxaban regimen (60 mg bid, 10.6 %, P = 0.002; 30 mg bid, 7.8 %, P = 0.029) than warfarin (3.2 %), however there were no significant differences between the warfarin and once-daily regimens. For the same total daily dose of edoxaban, 60 mg, the 30 mg bid dose was associated with a trend towards an increase in major bleeding plus CRNM bleeding compared with 60 mg qd (P = 0.08). This study concluded that treatment with edoxaban 30 or 60 mg qd was safe and well tolerated. A pooled pharmacokinetic analysis [64] was performed on data from 15 phase I and II studies which aimed to characterize edoxaban population pharmacokinetics. Using an exposure-response analysis (in which Cmin was the best predictor of bleed probability), a 50 % dose reduction in selected patients was recommended, especially in patients with renal impairment, concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors, and body weight â¤60 kg. Consequently, two doses of edoxaban (30 mg and 60 mg od) were selected for investigation in the phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial. The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study [59] investigated the safety and efficacy of two doses of edoxaban compared with warfarin. A total 21,105 patients with a history of AF were enrolled into the study making this the largest study of a NOAC in patients with AF to date. Patients were randomized to edoxaban 60 mg qd (n = 7012), edoxaban 30 mg qd (n = 7002) or warfarin (n = 7012; median time in therapeutic range, 68.4 %). In the edoxaban group, patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 30â50 mL/ min), weight â¤60 kg or who were receiving select P-gp inhibitors had a 50 % dose reduction. Median follow-up duration was 2.8 years.

0,183,0.912,Library and Information Sciences : Trends and Research,"Dataset Usage Index Indicators In (Ingwersen and Chavan 2011) the range of DUI indicators is defined, exemplified and discussed. They are based on the extracts of data from the GBIF event logs for datasets and are constructed according to common scientometric standards for research evaluation indicators (Moed 2005). Below we point to the most prominent indicators and discuss briefly their potentials, since they are characteristic for biodiversity datasets that are publicly available, searched and downloaded. Table 2 demonstrates 13 of the indicators, exemplified by dataset properties from three different dataset providers: The large network-like US-based Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the two Danish providers DanBIF and Herbarium of University of Aarhus (HUA). The Number of Datasets produced by a publisher (N(u)) at a given point in time may characterize the publisher into small (N < 10), Medium (10 < N < 100), Large (100 < N < 300) and ultra-large (N > 300). The reason behind this classification is that it is meaningless to compare between providers of quite different sizes. Like for citation impact small (often specialized) universities should not be compared to large universal universities. DanBIF is thus regarded a medium-size provider while HUA is seen as a small dataset producer. Table 2 provides an overall view of their characteristics (Ingwersen and Chavan 2011, p. 7). For the large-scale US provider OBIS the analysis window is one month against 6 month for the two other providers. Comparisons should hence not be carried out them in between. The Usage Ratio signifies the number of records downloaded over number of records searched during the same period. The higher the ratio the more searched records are also subsequently downloaded and imply a kind of social attractiveness of the datasets in question. The table shows that regardless of length of analysis window the numbers of Searched Records and Download Frequency were quite substantial in 2009, supporting the conception of a DUI. Download Events were very low compared to the number of Search Events across all three publishers and periods. Three years later the GBIF portal seems well established in the mind of the global research community, Fig. 5, with a Download Event score during the six-month period Februaryâ August 2013 for HUA raised to 4,226 events and with a Download Density reaching 196.6 against 15,205 Search Events with a corresponding much lower Density of 17.6 (Biodiversity data: Herbarium of University of Aarhus 2013). The Usage Balance between Download and Search Events was quite low in 2009: only approx. 1â2 % of the search events lead to direct downloading for the providers; for HUA less than 1 %. In 2013, for one HUA dataset, the Usage Balance reaches 28 %, implying that for each 4 search events there is one pure download event taking place, signifying that searchers seem more familiar with the dataset contents and do not require constantly to search and investigate the set prior to actual usage. This coincides with the Usage Ratio, or social attractiveness score, which for HUA during the six month in 2013 reaches 3.1 signifying that more than three times the searched records are actually downloaded."

In line with this observation, Fig. 13b shows that the difference between the 7zip scores achieved by VMs with 1 and 9 GB of VRAM grows with the number of VCPUs. However, the score difference is rather moderate compared to the large difference in terms of RAM utilization. In particular, a VM with 24 VCPUs utilizes more than 5 GB of RAM, if available. This is five times as much, as a VM with 1 GB of VRAM utilizes. However, the 7zip scores achieved by these VMs only differ by 15%."

The University of New Hampshire (UNH) Open Ocean Aquaculture Project (http://amac.unh.edu) had a demonstration unit of 12 ha at 10 km off the coast in the Gulf of Maine that included ï¬nï¬sh culture in submerged cages and shellï¬sh (mussels and scallops on submerged longlines (Langan 2009) (Fig. 2.11). Water depth is 52 m on average and the area is completely exposed (waves > 9 m high). The submerged longline system consists of a longline (130 m long, 28 mm polysteel rope) with 3 floats (2 for the anchoring lines and one in the middle). Each anchoring line (28 mm polysteel rope) is kept in place with a weight of 4 t and is connected directly to the anchor at an angle of 45Â°. The longline is kept at a depth of 10â12 m and carries mussel ropes that form loops of 7â12 m. In 1999, the ï¬rst two submerged longlines were installed. They are still in place and tended by commercial operators though the anchors and the floats have been replaced several times. Three km to the south (Boars Head), there is a commercial production with 10 longlines (Verhaeghe et al. 2011). More recently, UNH and New Hampshire Sea Grant have been developing IMTA platforms for marine ï¬sh, shellï¬sh and seaweeds (Fig. 2.12aâb). IMTA is where the culture of a fed product (i.e. ï¬sh) is combined with the culture of extractive species that bio-mitigate nutrients from the farm and surrounding waters."

The control rod is 7.5 mm thick, and the gap between the rod outer surface and the channel box is 1.6 mm on each side. The gap between channel boxes on the side without the control rod is 0.8 mm. The fuel rod diameter and gap of the RBWR-TB2 are 7.2 and 2.2 mm, respectively; these values result in a larger moderator-to-fuel ratio and a softer neutron energy spectrum than those of the RBWR-TB. Because the fissile composition of the RBWR-TB2 is larger than that of the RBWR-TB, fissile TRUs need to be fissioned with a relatively larger rate to preserve TRU isotopic composition for multi-recycling. The number of fuel rods is the same as that of the RBWR-TB to make the averaged linear heat-generating rate almost the same. The main core specifications and performance values of the RBWR-TB2 in the equilibrium core were shown earlier in Table 14.2. The core coolant flow is 2.4  104 t/h at a subcooling of 10 K at the entrance and has a steam quality of 36 % at the core exit. The concept of the loading pattern of fuel bundles in the equilibrium core is the same as that of the RBWR-TB: it adopts zone loading and the reflective boundary condition of 60  in the azimuthal direction. A maximum linear heat generation rate of 47 kW/m and an MCPR of 1.28 after the control rod scheduling are achieved. The RBWR-TB2 has a void reactivity coefficient of 4  10 4 Îk/k/%void. The fission efficiency of TRUs in the RBWR-TB2 is 45 %. This value corresponds to about twice the production efficiency of TRUs, 22 %, in the ABWR. Here, the production efficiency of TRUs is defined with the opposite meaning of the fission efficiency of TRUs, that is, the net increase in TRUs divided by the total amount of fissioned actinides through the total fuel residence time in the core. As the electricity output of the RBWR-TB2 is the same as that of the ABWR, this means accumulation of TRUs would be suppressed by introducing one RBWR-TB2 for two ABWRs."

If the blocks reached the top of the field, all blocks from the top half of the field were removed, as shown in Fig. 1b 3. The fast-drop function of the classic Tetris was disabled Modification 1 aimed to minimize eye movements caused by distracting objects on the screen. The purpose of modification 2 was to prevent the premature end of the game that normally occurs when the top of the field is reached, and modification 3 was implemented to compensate differences in the players performance and strategies, thus keeping the difficulty within one level constant across participants. The experiment was structured as follows: Each participant played a total of 9 games with 10 min each. Every game consisted of 10 consecutive 60-second blocks, of which each was assigned one of 10 predefined difficulty levels. In games 1, 4 and 7 the levels increased gradually with every block, while in the remaining games the assignment was randomly permuted. The difficulty of a level was defined by the itemsâ falling velocity: In level 1 the velocity was such that it required falling objects 10 s to reach the bottom of the game screen, while in level 10 this time was 2.5 s. The speed increase across levels was linear. A scoring system was implemented where the points for canceling a line are proportional to the level number and getting the field reduced takes points away. The score was presented to the player at the end of each game (Fig. 1c). To motivate an active participation in the game, the player with the highest score was rewarded a small price.

This decline, however, was transitory in nature and by 2008 the total catch in numbers of fish had again approached the eight million mark. The reasons for the precipitous decline in landings after 2004 are explored in more detail when catch of individual grouper species is considered. On average, less than 15 % of the aggregate grouper catch by recreational anglers in the Gulf in number of fish was harvested (A + B1); the remaining (approximately) 85 % was released alive (Figure 10.77, left panel). This percentage remained extremely consistent during the period of analysis (generally 83â89 % range) with the exception of the last 2 years when the percentage exceeded 90 %. The high release rate during the period reflects aggregate bag limits, minimum size restrictions, and closed seasons (Carter et al. 2008). Estimated aggregate harvest (A + B1) of grouper, expressed on a weight basis, is provided in Figure 10.77 (right panel) for the 1990â2009 period. As indicated, the annual harvest has fluctuated widely, ranging from less than three million pounds to more than eight million pounds. While some of the fluctuation can be explained by management actions (see individual species discussion), much of the variation likely simply reflects large annual recruitment variation. As a result of numerous environmental factors (most of which remain unknown), year-class size can vary by an order of magnitude and, as such, recruitment into the legal fishery (i.e., minimum legal size at harvest) can also vary substantially. Because of a high amount of pressure on the grouper stocks, a high percentage of the recreational grouper catch occurs shortly after the minimum legal size is reached. Overall, about 33 % of the aggregate reef fish harvest (A + B1), expressed on a weight basis, was represented by grouper during the period of analysis. The share of aggregate reef fish harvest in pounds represented by grouper reached a maximum of 53 % in 2000 but was only about 25 % in 2009. Grouper catch by recreational anglers consists primarily of two speciesâgag grouper and red grouperâwhich combined, account for about 95 % of the total recreational grouper harvest (A + B1) during 1990â2009. Annual harvests (A + B1) of these two species expressed on a weight basis are presented in Figure 10.78 (gag grouper, left panel; red grouper, right panel) for the 1990â2009 period. Gag grouper harvest, which accounted for about two-thirds of the total harvest of these two species, gradually increased through 2004 and declined sharply thereafter to a low of 1.5 million pounds in 2009.

Given the longer life of assets in developing countries, I assumed a 50 year average for both buildings and plants and machinery. As a consequence of this decision, capital formation in other construction and works is overexaggerated, as it also includes plant and machinery in gas and mining. However, such an upward bias is small given the size of capital formation in mining and gas. 26. Weights taken from TIOE58 were 0.49, construction materials and 0.51, mason wages. 27. The 15% share of total investment outlays and 60 years average life are taken from (Feinstein 1988: 305), for the case of Britain. The value of capital expenditure in electricity supply comes from Banco Central (1961). Installed electric power is available since 1901 in ReseÃ±a EstadÃ­stica (1952) and Anuario(s) EstadÃ­stico(s). Given its high correlation with electricity output (0.95 over 1901â1913), the installed capacity was backcasted with electricity output to 1890. For electricity output, see Carreras (1983, 1989). 28. Cf. Feinstein (1988). Construction costs include wages (0.51) and construction materials (0.49). In turn, plant and machinery include steel (0.44) and wages (0.56). 29. Capital expenditure by TelefÃ³nica, at current prices, for 1925â1958 was kindly supplied to me by Nelson Ãlvarez. The number of telephone ofï¬ces is available since 1902 and, assuming a life average above 60 years (Feinstein 1988) assumes 100 years, investment can be computed as ï¬rst differences. A 3 year average (Yt = (Xt â 2 + Xt â 1 + Xt)/3) was estimated to smoothing the investment series. 30. TIOE58 weights are 0.49, construction materials; 0.51, mason wages. 31. A 3 year moving average of the form, Yt = (Xt â 2 + Xt â 1 + Xt)/3, was used to smooth the series. GÃ³mez Mendoza (1989) provides data on telephone centres. It should be bear in mind that (Feinstein 1988) assumed a 100 years average life, but 60 years is enough to make my computational procedure acceptable as the period under consideration (1903â1958) is shorter and, hence, no scrapping has to be taken into account. 32. The level of capital formation on other constructions and works for 1958 provided in CNE58 was distributed among its components using TIOE58."

As discussed in some detail in a subsequent section, a similar trend is apparent in the number of Florida visitors (i.e., a sudden and significant increase in 2000). While it is tempting to suggest that this increase contributed to the large increase in the 2000 estimated fishing trips, one would think that increased visitation would manifest itself via an increase in for-hire trips. However, this mode did not show an appreciable increase in trips. 10.4.2.1.1 Angler Trips by Mode Trips in the MRIP database are reported on a mode basis. Three types of modes are considered: shore-based marine fishing trips, private/rental boat-based fishing trips, and charter-based trips. The overwhelming majority of the trips, as indicated by the information in Figure 10.61 (left panel), represent shore-based fishing or fishing from private/rental boats with the former representing about 35â40 % in recent years and the later representing 55â60 %. Furthermore, virtually all growth in the total estimated number of marine angler trips during 1990â2009 was the result of increasing private/rental boat-based trips. During 1990â1999, the number of private/rental boat-based angler trips averaged 9.1 million annually, and this mode of fishing constituted 54 % of the estimated total number of trips during the period. During the most recent 10-year period of analysis, the estimated number of angler trips associated with the private/rental boat mode increased to 13.6 million annually, and its share of the total advanced to almost 60 %. Shore-based angler trips averaged 7.9 million during 1990â2009, with a maximum estimate of 10 million being reported in 2004. During the 1990s, shore-based angler trips constituted a 42 % share of the total number based on an annual average of 7.1 million. With the large increase in private/rental boat angler trips since 2000, the share of total trips represented by the shore mode fell to 38 % based on an average of 8.7 million shore-based trips. For-hire-based marine fishing trips in the Gulf (excluding Texas) represent a very small share of the total number of angler trips. Specifically, during the 20-year period ending in 2009, less than 4 % of the total angler trips were represented by the for-hire sector. In absolute numbers, for-hire trips peaked at just below one million in 1997, and since 2000, have averaged 786,000 annually. In a recently completed analysis, Savolainen et al. (2012) estimated that the population of for-hire operators was 3,315 in 2009. Of this total, 189 were classified as head boats operations (defined as a firm whose primary vessel carries more than six passengers on the average trip), 789 were classified as charter operations (defined as a firm whose primary vessel carries six or fewer passengers, on average, per trip), and 2,337 guide boats (defined as a firm whose primary vessel carries six or fewer passengers per trip, is approximately 28 ft in length or less, and fishes inshore on more than 75 % of the trips). Savolainen et al. (2012) report that revenues (primarily fees and tips) associated with the Gulf of Mexico for-hire sector equaled $215 million in 2009, with about one-half of the total being derived by the guide operations. The estimated revenues given by Savolainen et al. (2012) compare favorably with those reported by NMFS for 2009 (i.e., $208 million). 10.4.2.1.2 Angler Trips by Area Fished The MRFSS/MRIP segments trips into three fishing areas: (1) inland waters (e.g., bays), (2) state territorial waters, and (3) EEZ waters, where the EEZ for Florida (west coast) is seaward of 9 nautical mi (16.7 km) and for Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana is seaward of 3 nautical mi (5.6 km). As indicated by the information in Figure 10.61 (right panel), the vast majority of angler trips occur in state waters (either inland or state territorial). Since 1990, 56 % of the annual total number of trips (20.1 million annual average) occurred in inland waters while an additional 35 % occurred in the state territorial waters.

Furthermore, we assume annual charges ct that are typical in the German market consisting of annual administration charges Î²Â· P throughout the contractâs lifetime, and acquisition charges Î± Â· T Â· P, which are equally distributed over the first 5 years of the contract.

The longer length segment was used for the longer transmitter-receiver separation, and the shorter length segment was used for the shorter separation. Using variable length segments, which has not been done in previous MMR studies, is useful not only to obtain a higher density of amplitudes at the shorter separation but also to ensure a good signal to noise ratio of the amplitude at the longer separation (one datum of the amplitude per approximately 10 m separation with a 10 10.7 T/A noise level for the 32 s segment, and one datum of the amplitude per approximately 100 m separation with a 10 11.5 T/A noise level for the 1,024 s segment) (Fig. 19.2). Segments were overlapped by their half length to augment the number of data stacking to obtain a good signal to noise ratio of the amplitude (for example, 32 s segments were overlapped by 16 s).

Endometrial cancer is traditionally subdivided into two types based on biological behavior: type 1 tumors are estrogen-dependent and include FIGO grades 1 and 2 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, while type 2 tumors include serous papillary carcinomas, clear cell adenocarcinomas, carcinosarcomas, and FIGO grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas [18]. Type 2 tumors are not estrogen dependent, present at a higher stage, and behave more aggressively."

The impulsive flare lasted about 1 min and was followed by a distinct harder emission phase that peaked in about 1 min and lasted for over 15 min. The energy spectrum of this sustained emission displayed a characteristic hump at photon energies above 60 MeV (Fig. 8.1a), which appeared to be consistent with that from pion-decays produced by the interaction of >300 MeV protons in the solar atmosphere (Forrest et al. 1985, see below); the authors speculated whether the emission might be associated with the acceleration of solar energetic particles. There were several more of these events in the ensuing years, all associated with intense X-class flares, that were summarized in a paper entitled âLong-Duration Solar Gamma-Ray Flaresâ (LDGRFs) (Ryan 2000).

Precipitation amount shows considerable intra-annual (see a selection of months in the E-Supplement Fig. S1.5.8) and interannual variability. For the reference period October 1978 to August 1987, February and/or April were the driest months. February 1986 was unusually dry with widespread means of less than 10 mm, even in coastal areas. Some areas were even rainless (e.g. in the region of De Bilt). Because February 1985 and 1986 received well below-average precipitation, the February mean for the period 1979â1987 was about 10 mm less than for the period 1971â2000 and about half the average for the period 1988â2008. The difference was greatest in the Shetland Islands. At Lerwick, the February mean was 62 mm for the period 1979â1987, 108 mm for 1971â2000 and 144 mm for 1988â2008. The HOAPS data show May as the driest month with average precipitation amounts of less than 25 mm in an extended area east and north of the British Islands.

388,863,0.909,The European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Textbook For Nurses : Under The Auspices of Ebmt,"Various definitions of engraftment exist in the literature. Engraftment is most commonly defined as the first of three consecutive days of achieving a sustained peripheral blood neutrophil count of >500 Ã 106/L (Wolff 2002). Platelet engraftment is usually defined as independence from platelet transfusion for at least 7 days with a platelet count of more than >20 Ã 109/L (Teltschik et al. 2016). The two major factors affecting engraftment are the graft source and the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning regimen. Generally, there are three common sources of HSCT grafts: bone marrow (BM), harvested from the iliac crest; peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), following G-CSF mobilization of HSC to the peripheral circulation with later collection of these cells by leukapheresis; and cord blood (CB). Champlin et al. (2000) published a large retrospective multivariate analysis which compared results of 288 HLA-identical sibling PBSC transplantations with results of 536 HLA-identical sibling BM transplantations. Patients who received PBSC had significantly faster recovery of neutrophils and platelets compared to BM transplants. Neutrophils exceed the threshold of 500 Ã 106/L between 2 and 6 days earlier with PBSC than after BM. In an EBMT study, the time interval for engraftment was 12 days for PBSC and 15 days for BM. Platelet recovery is also faster by approximately 6 days, i.e., platelet recovery of 20 Ã 109/L was reached at day +15 for PBSC patients and day +20 for patients receiving BM (Schmitz et al. 2002). CB transplant is associated with delayed engraftment. A large study of 1268 patients (73% children) with acute leukemia (64% acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 36% acute myeloid leukemia) in remission analyzed engraftment kinetics and outcomes after a single-unit CB transplantation with"

70,379,0.909,Optics in Our Time,"In spite of the two severe economical downturns, considerable progress has occurred since 2000 in designing advanced optical communication systems, leading to the ï¬fth and sixth generations of such systems. The focus of ï¬fth-generation systems was on making the WDM systems more efï¬cient spectrally. This was accomplished by reviving the coherent detection scheme that was studied in the late 1980s but abandoned soon after ï¬ber-based optical ampliï¬ers became available. Coherent receivers capable of detecting both the amplitude and phase of an optical signal through a heterodyne scheme were developed soon after the year 2000. Their commercial availability near the end of the decade allowed system designers to employ advanced modulation formats in which information is encoded using both the amplitude and phase of an optical carrier. The basic concept can be understood from . Fig. 8.11 , showing four modulation formats using the so-called constellation diagram that displays the real and imaginary parts of the complex electric ï¬eld along the x and y axes, respectively. The ï¬rst conï¬guration represents the standard binary format, called amplitude-shift keying (ASK), in which the amplitude or intensity of the electric ï¬eld takes two values, marked by circles and representing 0 and 1 bits of a digital signal. The second conï¬guration is another binary format, called phase-shift keying (PSK), in which the amplitude remains constant but phase of the electric ï¬eld takes two values, say 0 and Ï, that represent the 0 and 1 bits of a digital signal. The third conï¬guration in part (c) of . Fig. 8.11 shows the quaternary PSK (or QPSK) format in which the optical phase takes four possible values. This case allows to reduce the signal bandwidth since two bits can be transmitted during each time slot, and the effective bit rate is halved. Borrowing from microwave communication terminology, the reduced bit rate is called the symbol rate (or baud). The last example in . Fig. 8.11 shows how the symbol concept can be extended to multilevel signaling such that each symbol carries 4 bits or more. An additional factor of two can be gained if one transmits two orthogonally polarized symbols simultaneously during each symbol slot, a technique referred to as polarization division multiplexing. The concept of spectral efï¬ciency, deï¬ned as the number of bits transmitted in 1 s within a 1-Hz bandwidth, is quite useful in understanding the impact of coherent detection in combination with phase-encoded modulation formats. The spectral efï¬ciency of fourth generation WDM systems that employed ASK as the modulation format was limited to below 0.8 bit/s/Hz since at most 40 billion bits/s could be transmitted over a 50-GHz bandwidth of each WDM channel. This value for the ï¬fth-generation systems can easily exceed 3 by using polarization multiplexing in combination with the QPSK format. . Figure 8.12 shows how the spectral efï¬ciency of optical communication systems has evolved since 1990 when its value was near 0.05 bit/s/Hz. Values near 2 bit/s/Hz were realized by 2005 and they approached 10 bit/s/Hz by the year 2010 [19]. The availability of coherent receivers and increased computing speeds led to another advance after it was realized that one can use digital signal processing to"
137,384,0.908,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Box 11.1: Part-Time Parental Leave and Partial Rate Child Rearing Benefit in France Part-time parental leave is covered by French labour law, offering the parents of young children the right to temporarily reduce their professional activity until the third birthday of their youngest child. In order to benefit, the parent must be an employee, must have at least one child under the age of 3, and must have been working for their employer for at least a year at the time of the childâs birth. People on parental leave are not paid. Rather the French social protection system offers fathers and mothers a family benefit, the ComplÃ©ment de libre choix dâactivitÃ© (ClCA), which is allocated provided that certain previous employment conditions are met. The partial rate CLCA is available for parents with children below the age of 3 who are working part-time. Its aim is to compensate, in part, for their decreased income. For a first child, the partial rate CLCA can be received for 6 months, or until the child turns 3 years of age from the second child onwards. The amount of partial rate CLCA is paid on flat rate basis and depends on the hours worked. At he time the survey was carried out, the value of the partial rate CLCA varied from: â â¬247.98 to â¬430.40 per month if the parent works below 50 % (of full-time hours) â â¬143.05 to â¬325.47 per month if the parent works between 50 % and 80 % of full-time. Since 2004, a larger financial incentive to opt for the partial-rate CLCA encourages part-time work. As a result, partial-rate CLCA take-up has increased remarkably. Until 2003, the number of beneficiaries of partial-rate was stable â at around 134,000 recipients â just over 26 % of all recipients. From the end of 2003 to the end of 2010, the proportion of beneficiaries receiving the partial rate grew considerably, by 60 %, reaching 45 % in 2013. Uptake of this benefit by men is still rare, with fathers making up only 3.7 % of the recipients. There is a more frequent uptake by men of the partial-rate CLCA (71 % compared to 45 % for the mothers). In addition, 27 % of these fathers, compared to 1 % of the mothers, receive the allowance at the same time as their partners). As part of a bill aiming at equality between men and woman, a reform of the CLCA was introduced on January 2015. Its objective was in particular to ensure a fairer division of the time mothers and fathers spend with their child (ren). Breakdown of mothers and fathers receiving the CLCA different rates"

While exhibiting significant interyear variation, the number of trips, in general, exhibited an upward trend during the period of analysis. Despite two hurricanes in 2005 (Katrina and Rita) that impacted a significant portion of Louisianaâs coastal infrastructure, the reported number of trips in that year fell by only about 20 % when compared to 2004 (which was the record year), and by 2006, the number of trips approached that observed pre-hurricanes. The observed number of trips in 2009 equaled 4.1 million, which represented about a 10 % decline in relation to the previous year. Louisianaâs recreational fishery is overwhelmingly inland in nature. Since 1995, recreational trips in inland waters averaged 3.2 million annuallyâmore than 85 % of the total number of recreational trips (Figure 10.101, left panel). The percentage of trips in state territorial waters averaged 312,000 annually during 1995â2009 and ranged from a high of 20 % in 1997 to less than 4 % (2008 and 2009). In general, the proportion of total trips occurring in territorial waters has fallen during the period of analysis with a concomitant increase in the percentage of trips occurring in inland waters. During the period of analyses, the reported number of recreational trips in federal waters averaged 120,000 annually representing approximately 3 % of the total number of trips. As indicated by the information in Figure 10.101 (right panel), 20â30 % of the total annual trips are shore based. Another 2â4 % of the trips used for-hire services. The majority of the trips, almost 75 % of the total, represent use of private/rental boats. With respect to the Louisiana for-hire sector, Savolainen et al. (2012) estimate that the population of for-hire boats (more specifically, captains) equaled 681 in 2009 and that the number has increased substantially since the 1990s. Of this total, 100 were charter boats, 575 were guide boats, and the remaining 6 were head boats. The average number of trips made by charter vessels equaled 75, and net income to owners from charter boat operations averaged $40,000. Guide boat operations, by comparison, averaged 71 trips with net income accruing to the owner estimated at $28,000 on average."

In order to improve the identification rate and obtain complete peptide sequences, the proteolytic peptides are derivatized by 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC). This N-terminal chemical derivatization increases the structural information and the efficiency of post-source decay (PSD) fragmentation (Fig. 13.2). The reaction delivers a negative sulfonic acid group to the N-terminus of the proteolytic peptides leading to suppression of b-ions (see Note 15). Consequently, only positively charged ions (y-ions) are observed in MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra (Fig. 13.3) (Joss et al. 2006; Gevaert et al. 2001). 1.

Interestingly, it was initially planned as a communications experiment and not envisaged to be used operationally to send telemetry data to Earth. However, its superior performance over the standard operational communications system which featured uncoded transmission meant that it was always used instead of the standard system. In 1969, the Marinerâ69 spacecraft was launched with a first order ReedâMuller (32, 6, 16) code [8] equivalent to the extended (32, 6, 16) cyclic code. A maximum likelihood correlation decoder was used. The coding gain was 2.2 dB [9]. By the mid 1970s, the standard for soft decision decoding on the AWGN channel notably applications for satellite communications and space communications was to use convolutional codes with Viterbi decoding, featuring the memory 7 code listed in Table 10.1.

At 15 GHz, the fringe width was of order 0.3 mas, and interpretation of the results in terms of circular Gaussian models indicated brightness temperatures as high as 2 $ 1012 K. VLBI observations using a satellite in a non-geostationary orbit were first made in 1997 by the VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP) (Hirabayashi et al. 1998), designed specifically for VLBI observations. It was equipped with an antenna of 8-m diameter, and observations were made at 1.6 and 5 GHz. The orbital period was approximately 6.6 h and the apogee height, 21,000 km. VSOP was followed by the RadioAstron satellite, which was launched in 2011 into an orbit with an apogee height of about 300,000 km and a period of 8.3 days (Kardashev et al. 2013).

The high Cs concentration for the initial 100 days was taken from the coastal monitoring data off Iwasawa, which is 16 km south of the FNPP (Tsumune et al. 2012; TEPCO 2014). As a proxy for moderately contaminated water, we used a value that was 1/10 of the high concentration (see Fig. 3 in Tateda et al. 2013). For the Cs concentrations in food consumed by fish â¥1 year old for six 6-month periods from March 2011 to February 2014, we used values of 80, 40, 10, 5, 2, and 1 Bq/kg-wet, which were based on monitoring data for Japanese sand lance and Japanese anchovy (bait fish) in the coastal waters off northern Fukushima Prefecture (northern half of area IV) (Fisheries Agency 2014) (Fig. 11.5b). For fish younger than 1 year old, we used food concentrations of 40, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 Bq/kg-wet for the same 6-month periods; these values were based on data for mysids in the same area (Sohtome et al. 2014). Fish in the 2009 year-class fed on bait fish throughout the simulation period; the fish in the 2010 year-class fed on mysids from March to August 2011 and then shifted to bait fish; and fish in the 2011 and 2012 year-classes fed on mysids during their first 12 months (Fig. 11.4). The coefficient for Cs intake from seawater (a) was set at 0.1 (approximately equal to the value of 0.11 reported by Tateda et al. 2013). DR and AR were set at 0.02 (Kurita et al., unpublished data) and 0.6 (between the value of 0.5 reported by Tateda et al. 2013 and the value of 0.78 reported by Kasamatsu et al. 2001), respectively. BHL was set at 104 days so that the saturated Cs concentration in the fish body was twice the Cs concentration in the food, which was the observed relationship between the concentrations in fish body and food in the equilibrium state before the accident (Kasamatsu and Ishikawa 1997). In the simulations, we focused on three issues: variation of the Cs concentrations among individuals, the influence of the contamination history during the initial 100 days, and differences in Cs concentrations among the year-classes. First, the effect of Cs concentration in the seawater was evaluated (Fig. 11.5câe). The Cs concentrations in the fish body were simulated for fish in the 2009 yearclass, which fed on bait fish and were exposed to seawater categories A, B, or C. Differences in the Cs intake levels from seawater during the initial 100 days after the accident produced large variations in the maximum Cs concentrations (Fig. 11.5c): 109 Bq/kg-wet (2.04 log transformed; sources of Cs were seawater C + food), 286 Bq/kg-wet (2.46 log transformed; seawater B + food), and 2,504 Bq/ kg-wet (3.40 log transformed; seawater A + food). For fish that were exposed to directly released water (seawater A or B), the body Cs concentration peaked shortly after the accident, at 43 days (23 April 2011) and at 50 days (30 April 2011) for seawaters A and B, respectively, and then decreased rapidly. Even if fish did not take up Cs from seawater during the initial 100 days (seawater C), the body Cs concentration increased to 109 Bq/kg-wet at 184 days (11 September 2011), which corresponds to the peak period of the lowest observed concentrations (as described in Sect. 11.2). High individual variation and a gradual increase in the lowest concentrations until September were observed in the monitored data (Figs. 11.1 and 11.2).

118,125,0.907,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Chemical properties such as the vapor pressure of each element must be taken into account in the release rate from RPV and PCV as shown in Fig. 3.9. Some appropriate assumptions must be made for estimates of released amounts by the accident, except for noble gases (fully released). Released radioactive materials exist in the water or steam of the RVP and PCV due to their chemical properties and damage to the RPV and PCV. Particles in the fuel generated by rapid cooling after melting might be dispersed in the water. Some parts of the radionuclide in the gas phase were released in the accident. Some part of the species in the liquid phase is considered to have been transported to the gas phase by the entrainment. The release fraction to the environment from the reactor is very complicated because it reflects various events causing RI release, such as seat leakage from the flanges or bulbs (including SRV release to a leaking vessel), venting, hydrogen explosion, and damage to the suppression chamber. Therefore, we tentatively assumed the release fraction [(B) in Fig. 3.9] from the RPV + PCV + Reactor Building to the atmosphere considering the vapor pressure of the elements: Xe 100 %; Kr 100%; Cs 1 %; I 1 %; Te 0.1 %; Sr 10â4; Ba 10â4; Zr 10â4; Np 10â4; Pu 10â5; 3H 25 %; etc. In this evaluation we also assumed these releases occurred at one day after the scram by the earthquake. Although these assumptions are different from the actual accident scheme, our estimation can give us a fundamental understanding of RI release.3 We calculated released amounts to the environment by multiplying the inventory by the release fraction from the fuel [(A) in Fig. 3.9] and by that from the reactor [(B) in Fig. 3.9]. The calculation results of amounts released are: 3H 9.4 Ã 1014Bq; 85Kr 7.6 Ã 1016Bq; 89 Sr 3.9 Ã 1014Bq; 90Sr 3.5 Ã 1013Bq; 129mTe 2.9 Ã 1014Bq; 131I 6.0 Ã 1016Bq; 133Xe 1.3 Ã 1019Bq; 137Cs 7.6 Ã 1015Bq; 134Cs 7.4 Ã 1015Bq; 249Np 8.8 Ã 1013Bq; 241Pu 1.4 Ã 1010Bq; 241Am 8.9 Ã 107Bq for fuel damage at 2,800 Â°C for 1 h. The 131I equivalent amount of radionuclide is evaluated as 4.9 Ã 1017Bq using the conversion factor in the INES manual (Table 3.3). The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) reported it as 7.7 Ã 1017Bq calculated by the MELCOR code [10]. As to the release points of radioactive materials, they are released from the venting stack in accidents without severe damage. However, in the 1F accident, these were also released from the disrupted points of the PCV, duct pipes, and the reactor building. Moreover, contaminated water was released into the sea through the tunnel of 1F2 from a crack in the concrete pit."

A ï¬rst design consisted of the floating frame with 45 mussel ropes of 10 m whose ends were attached at one point. A weight prevented the ropes of friction against each other and to get entangled (Fig. 2.4câd). The whole construction was anchored with a heavy weight and foreseen of a contra-weight to compensate for the tugging. Later, it was decided to include a closed frame so the whole construction could be lifted at once into the boat. By the end of 2000, however, the cages were lost due to insufï¬cient anchoring and floating devices. In 2001, two different systems were designed for mussel seed collection and grow-out.

This scenario projects the strongest increase in winter (18 %), and change in the transition seasons are 10 and 11 %, respectively. For annual mean precipitation, the RCP8.5 scenario projects a future increase of about 7 %, which is slightly larger than the inter-model standard deviation.

In September 2008, a trial impoundment of 175 m ASL commenced in the reservoir. The water level increased by about 100 m from the original water level of about 75 m. In addition, a 30-m annual variation in water level was speciï¬ed by reservoir regulations. As a result of the combined effect of the large water level variation, relocation, and other factors, the geological conditions in the Three Gorges area have been signiï¬cantly changed, and challenges in terms of geological hazards prevention have been encountered in the Yangtze River (Yin et al. 2016c). This project ï¬rst presents the spatiotemporal distribution of landslides in six periods of 175 m ASL trial impoundments from 2008 to 2014. The results show that the number of landslides sharply decreased from 273 at the initial stage to less than ten at the second stage of impoundment. Figure 6 shows the locations of landslides induced by six periods of 175 m asl trial impoundments. From a geographical perspective, reservoir-induced landslides are mainly distributed along the main streams and some branches of the Yangtze River. Because of the marked differences in geological environment conditions of slopes along the Yangtze River, major differences in landslide occurrences in various sections were observed. Based on this, the reservoir-induced landslides in the Three Gorges region can be roughly classiï¬ed into ï¬ve failure patterns, i.e., accumulation landslides, dip-slope landslides, reversed bedding landslides, rockfalls, and karst breccia landslides. The accumulation landslides and dip-slope landslides account for more than 90%. The Shuping accumulation landslides (a sliding mass volume of 20.7  106 m3) in Zigui County and the Outang dip-slope landslide (a sliding mass volume of about 90  106 m3) in Fengjie County are two typical cases; the mechanisms of reactivation of the two landslides were analyzed (Figs. 7 and 8). The monitoring data and factor of safety (FOS) calculations show that the accumulation landslide is dominated by water level variation in the reservoir, as most of the mass body is under 175 m ASL, and that the dip-slope landslide is controlled by the coupling effect of reservoir water level variation and precipitation, with an extensive recharge area of rainfall from the rear, and a front mass below 175 m ASL."

86,479,0.906,Nuclear Back-End and Transmutation Technology For Waste Disposal : Beyond The Fukushima Accident,"We carried out batch sorption experiments using 63 Japanese rice paddy soil samples to clarify the transfer pathways of 14C in rice paddy fields. The soil samples were collected throughout Japan and taken to our laboratory where they were air dried and sieved (<2 mm). These sieved soils were mixed with a [1,2-14C] sodium acetate solution at the ratio of soil : solution Â¼ 0.5 g : 5 ml, and the flooded soil samples were incubated at 25  C for 7 days [2]. During the incubation period, the C atoms of the sodium acetate were partitioned into solid, liquid, and gas phases. Each partitioning ratio is shown in Fig. 26.1. Approximately 63 % of the total 14C on average was released into the air as gaseous compounds. Partitioning ratios into solid and liquid phases were 34 % and 3 %, respectively. These results suggest that gasification is an important pathway in the environmental transfer of 14C in Japanese rice paddy fields. When 14C is released into the air, 14C-bearing gases must pass through the soil solution. Because soil solution pH affects chemical reactions such as hydrolysis and degassing of CO2, chemical forms of 14C-bearing gases may change in the soil solution. We, therefore, investigated relationships between pH and partitioning ratios of 14C into the liquid phase at day 7 of incubation (Fig. 26.2). The partitioning ratio increased with increasing in pH, and a significant correlation (r Â¼ 0.7) was found. These data fit well with the solubility curve of total carbonic acid in water, which refers to the sum of dissolved carbon dioxide and the carbonic acid. This observation suggested that the dominant chemical species of 14C in gas forms was carbon dioxide. To confirm the effect of pH on the partitioning of 14C into the liquid phase, a soil sample was suspended in MES [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid] buffers with the initial pH value adjusted to 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 (Fig. 26.3).

Making observations (i.e., measuring the coherency vector) of sources for which the polarization parameters are already known is clearly a way of determining the leakage and gain terms. The number of unknown parameters to be calibrated is proportional to the number of antennas, na , but the number of measurements is proportional to the number of baselines, na .na ! 1/=2. The unknown parameters are therefore usually overdetermined, and a least-meansquares solution may be the best procedure. For any antenna with orthogonally polarized receiving channels, there are seven degrees of freedom, that is, seven unknown quantities, that must be calibrated to allow full interpretation of the measured Stokes visibilities. This applies to the general case, and the number can be reduced if approximations are made for weak polarization or small instrumental polarization. In terms of the polarization ellipses, these unknowns can be regarded as the orientations and ellipticities of the two orthogonal feeds and the complex gains (amplitudes and phases) of the two receiving channels. When the outputs of two antennas are combined, only the differences in the instrumental phases are required, leaving seven degrees of freedom per antenna. Sault et al. (1996) make the same point from the consideration of the Jones matrix of an antenna, which contains four complex quantities. They also give a general result that illustrates the seven degrees of freedom or unknown terms. This expresses the relationship between the uncorrected (measured) Stokes visibilities (indicated by primes) and the true values of the Stokes visibilities, in terms of seven ' and Ä± terms: 32 3 Iv0 !

An electric impulse was generated by a high speed switching semiconductor. The start of the pulse was within 400 ps, the pulse width was 2 ns and the pulse voltage was 40 V. The frequency of the impulse covered up to 500 MHz. The electric impulse was used to excite a vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) transducer. The aperture diameter of the transducer was 2.0 mm, and the focal length was 4 mm. The central frequency was 100 MHz, the bandwidth ( 6 dB) was 40â120 MHz, and the pulse repetition rate was 2,800 Hz. First, the transducer was mounted on the X-Y scanner with two linear servo motors that were controlled by X-Y scan controller connected to the serial port of the PC. The scan area was 2  2 mm with 100  100 pixels. Four pulse echo sequences with 4,096 sampling points along the depth z were averaged for each scan point in order to increase the S/N ratio.

The exponent of the degree distribution is independent of the number of nodes connected in the first step  and in each secondary step  as well, its value is D 2:895 Ë 0:038 as expected. The value of the exponent is obtained by averaging the exponents of systems at different input parameter combinations. This independence needs some explanations.

How can this network be scale-free? As a matter of fact the 90 % also preferred, because sooner or later these neighbors also become popular as they popular neighbor gets more and more links. To characterize the networks from the point of view of the cliques I calculated the clustering coefficient of nodes in my undirected graphs. Local clustering coefficient C of a node is the ratio of the number of existing links between neighbors of this node and the number of possible connection between them. In a general case C is proportional to the reciprocal of the degree of node, which indicates small degree nodes are mainly members of cliques while hubs of the networks connect them together."

The data are available since 1968 in annual files. Additionally, the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides data since 1959, which we used in our analyses. The last year in our analysis is 2014. With the exception of 1972, when only a 50% sample was taken, each file contains all deaths in the United States. In the analysis by cause of death in later chapters of this volume, we simply multiplied the number of deaths for a given age, sex, and cause in the year 1972 by a factor of 2. Causes of death are coded by the so-called âInternational Classification of Diseasesâ (ICD). Since its introduction in the late nineteenth century, the system has been revised at irregular intervals (MeslÃ© 2006). The tenth revision is currently used. During the first years of our analysis, ICD-7 was used. ICD-8 was in effect in the United States between 1968 and 1978, followed by ICD-9 from 1979 until 1998. Obtaining consistent time series of causes of death across ICD revisions requires meticulous work and care (e.g., MeslÃ© and Vallin 1996; PechholdovÃ¡ 2009). We therefore decided to use only very broad categories for causes of death and followed primarily the coding of Janssen et al. (2003) and of MeslÃ© and Vallin (2006a). Both papers include an appendix with detailed ICD codes across the four revisions required in our analysis. Table 3.2 is split into two halves. The upper panel provides the ICD codes we used to extract the causes of death, whereas the lower panel lists the number of deaths in absolute and relative terms for the selected causes by sex. Our database consists of more than 118 million deaths. Although we have selected very few causes, they account for about three quarters of all deaths (Category 13 âOtherâ is 23.75%). A bit more than 44% of all deaths classified as originating from circulatory diseases. In that category, heart diseases are about one third of all deaths for women and men alike. The almost 10 million deaths from cerebrovascular diseases between 1959 and 2014 represent about eight percent of all deaths. The most common cerebrovascular disease is stroke.

The faster electrons arrive 30â90 min before the slower protons at Lagrangian point 1. The Relativistic Electron Alert System for Exploration (REleASE) forecasting scheme uses this effect to predict the proton flux by utilizing the actual electron flux and the increase of the electron flux in the last 60 min. A detailed description of the REleASE scheme can be found in (Posner 2007). The original REleASE code uses real-time electron flux measurements from the Electron Proton Helium Instrument (EPHIN) (MÃ¼ller-Mellin 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to forecast the expected proton flux. REleASE is based on electron intensity measurements of energies from 0.25 to 1 MeV and their intensity changes. It utilizes an empirical matrix in order to predict the proton intensity 30, 60 or 90 min ahead. Figure 7.4b displays the forecast matrix for one proton channel and the 60-min interval. EPHIN provides realtime data which are used with the REleASE scheme. One disadvantage of EPHIN data is the limited time coverage in the realtime data of less than 4 h per day. If no realtime data are available as input for the REleASE scheme, no forecast can be produced. The Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (EPAM) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) was selected to be a good candidate to deliver continuously input for REleASE because of the nearly full time coverage. EPAM provides realtime electron intensities in a comparable energy range (0.175â0.315 MeV vs. 0.25â 1.0 MeV) but in a time resolution of 5 min instead of 1 min. The forecast depends on the measured electron intensities and their increase. Hence we decided to determine a correlation between the intensities and the increase parameter. Figure 7.4a shows the time profile of EPAM (red) and EPHIN"

273,277,0.905,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"of all levels in the 3 countries. Taking their efforts in enhancing their environment competitiveness into consideration, we summarized the findings as follows: 1. Chinaâs environment competitiveness remains steady and still moves forward, with obvious achievements in environmental protection. In 2012, Chinaâs environment competitiveness ranked 87th worldwide, located in the down-middle position among the list. Among Chinaâs indicators ranking higher than 60th, 1 was sub-index, accounting for 20 % of total number of indicators and this indicator ranked top 10; 7 were pillars, accounting for 43.75 % of total indicators and 2 of them entered top 10; 17 were individual indicators, accounting for 28.33 % of total indicators and 3 of them were among top 10. However, among the indicators ranking below 60th, 80 % were sub-indexes, 56.25 % were pillars and 71.67 % were individual indicators; these directly influenced the global ranking of Chinaâs environment competitiveness. Since the start of this new century, especially after the 16th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee led by Secretary General Hu Jintao adhered to leading social and economic development with scientific outlook of development as well as the fundamental national policy of resource conservation and environment protection, thoroughly implemented the strategy of sustainable development, and initially put forward the key proposal and strategic mission of constructing ecological civilization; this has provided a solid theoretical basis, a far-reaching goal and driving force for Chinese people to realize harmonious development between human and nature, environment and economy, and human and society, pushing the socialism under Chinese context into a new space. Particularly during the â11th Five-Yearâ period, the entire environmental protection input reached RMB 2.1 trillion, the installed capacity of thermal power units over 300 MW as a proportion of total capacity increased from 47 % to 71 %, and the proportion of blast furnace over 1,000 m3 capacity in steel industry also increased from 21 % to 52 %. In the future, there will be more energy conservation and emission reductions projects to accelerate the structuring of clean and efficient industrial system and"

As indicated, the estimated brown shrimp parent population (defined as over 7 months of age during NovemberâFebruary) increased significantly in recent years but with large annual variations. For example, the estimated parent population in 2005 (approximately 400 million shrimp) exceeded the 2004 estimate (approximately 300 million shrimp) by 33 %. Similarly, the 2007 estimate (approximately 500 million) exceeded the 2008 estimate (approximately 350 million) by about 50 % with the 2009 estimate (approximately 500 million) exceeding the 2008 estimate by about 150 million shrimp. The estimated white shrimp parent population clearly showed an increasing trend since the late 1990s. Nance (2011) hypothesizes that this is related to an increase in the number of overwintering white shrimp (while not stated by Nance, this is likely the result of a decline in white shrimp effort; see Figure 10.20). Like brown shrimp, the estimated population of white shrimp parents can vary substantially from one year to the next with percentage changes of"

18,49,0.904,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"After the SBO, RCIC of Unit 2 was functioning. However, until about 10:00 on March 14, more than 3 h earlier than the RCIC stop time, the water level of the RPV was decreasing and the pressure of RPV was increasing. It is believed that this trend shows that RCIC was losing its core-cooling capability. At the central control room, operators tried to rapidly depressurize RPV by opening the safety relief valves, and it was only possible after 5 to 6 h because of the delay for preparing batteries. The reason of this delay was the immediate chaos caused by the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3, resulting in much time needed to prepare the large amount of batteries. When the depressurization was initiated by opening the safety valves, the RPV water level was almost half of the core. The water level then reached to the bottom of the core, resulting in the loss of water in the core region. As shown in Fig. 3.5, the increase of D/W pressure initiated after about 19:00 on March 14, and it showed almost the same value as the RPV pressure, which indicates the occurrence of the RPV failure. After the RPV pressure and D/W pressure increased with values similar to each other, they remained at the high values of 0.6 to 0.7 MPa for more than 7 h, which is much higher than the design pressure (0.427 MPa). Around this time, FPs in the RPV were released into D/W, which is indicated by the rapidly increased dose rate in D/W (Fig. 3.5). Through the flanges, hatches, airlocks, and penetrations with gaskets degraded by the high temperature and high pressure of the containment, hydrogen and volatile fission products, such as iodine, and cesium, were released to the reactor building, a similar phenomenon as the hydrogen explosion process in Units 1 and 3.

Since inter-individual differences in the frequency range of the alpha and theta band are expected, the bands rendering the best performance were determined for every participant individually. For that purpose a sweep over frequency bands ranging from around 3 to 14 Hz using only one SPoC component was performed. The width of the bands scaled logarithmically with the frequency to obtain a higher resolution for lower frequencies. Figure 2 shows the correlation of predicted with the true levels for every participant as a function of frequency band. While for participants 1 and 6 the band that yields the best prediction is in the alpha range, for participants 3 to 5 the best prediction is achieved in the theta range.

According to the MRIP survey data, since 2000, approximately 43 % of the Louisiana interviewed respondents, on average, reported that red drum was one of the two primary species targeted. In 2001, for example, there was an estimated 3.6 million angler trips. Of this total, an estimated 1.7 million (48 %) of the total, reported red drum as one of the two primary species being targeted (Figure 10.113, left panel). This year represents the highest red drum targeting behavior during the 10-year period of analysis. Conversely, the lowest reported red drum targeting behavior (on a percentage basis) was reported in 2005 and 2006 when 1.5 million of the approximately four million angler trips (38 %) indicated red drum as one of the two primary targeted species. While an angler may specify that he or she is targeting red drum on any given trip, it does not necessarily imply that red drum will be caught. A comparison between red drum targeted trips and trips where the catch of red drum is reported is presented in Figure 10.113 (right panel). As indicated, targeted trips consistently exceeded catch trips though the correlation between the two was a respectable 0.88. Since 1995, the estimated number of red drum caught expressed in numbers of fish (A + B1 + B2) has averaged 5.4 million annually with an associated range of 4.1 million in 1996 to 6.6 million in 2000 (Figure 10.114).

Backup demand of 100% and network capacity of 200 Mbps are used. As can be seen in Fig. 6, by increasing the number of scenarios, the percentage of admitted requests decreases and the SARA+ approach performs better with fine-grained timeslot sizes. We notice that the advance bandwidth reservation system gains more by deploying the SARA+ approach and with the 5-min timeslot size, shows up to 7.3% higher request admittance ratio. The time complexity of the approaches are evaluated in Fig. 7 for an increasing range of scenarios. This figure reveals that the granularity of timeslot size impacts the execution times of both approaches differently. While with 30-min timeslot size, the execution time of SARA+ is up to 147 milliseconds higher compared to the SARA approach, with 5-min timeslots, this time is up to 4.5 second lower. These results indicate that the quality and complexity of the advance bandwidth reservation system can be improved by deploying the SARA+ approach with fine-grained timeslot sizes.

The dominant sequence was that the personnel failed the door opening on the roof after the 1st awareness of the snow removal necessity, resulting in the loss of decay heat removal system due to snow. Importance and sensitivity analyses indicated a high risk contribution to secure the access routes. Looking at Fig. 9.2, the dominant snowfall speed of 1â2 m/day is approximately 10 2/year of annual access probability (at 1 m/day of snowfall), and the dominant snow depth of 1â1.5 m is approximately 10 1/year (at 1 m of snow depth). Such frequencies are not so low that we are aware of the importance of relatively high frequent hazard through this study. The PRA results would be served for the development of safety measures and accident management. In general, although careful attention may be often paid to extremely low-frequency events bringing high consequence, significant hazard intensity could be clarified through PRA studies. The event tree methodology is well known as a classical manner for the PRA; however, it is difficult to express time-dependent event sequences including recovery. Therefore, a new assessment technique was also being developed for the event sequence evaluation based on a continuous Markov chain Monte Carlo method with plant dynamics analysis [14]."

118,119,0.904,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Note that by using SRVs to depressurize the RPV, external water injection becomes possible. However, flash boiling (see Appendix B) can accelerate the core exposure. SRV operation after core damage can therefore cause a significant transport of radioactive materials out of the RPV into the SC. Figure 3.8 shows the temporal evolution of the ambient dose observed at different locations after the initial prominent radioactive release on March 15. [North <50 km from 1F] The plume on March 15 (Fig. 3.7, D1) soon passed and the ambient dose rate decreased rapidly, particularly in distant locations. However, the plume initiated by the SC rupture (Fig. 3.7, D2), propagated to the Northwest direction and caused fallout/washout/rainout due to rainfall and/or snowfall. This contributed to the significant increase in dose rates in these areas, such as Iitate-mura (NW 40 km) (Fig. 3.8, F). Although the origin of the later peaks at the main gate (Gate M) of 1F, indicated in Fig. 3.7 as D3 and D4, has not yet been rigorously identified, the release of radioactive materials still continued even after March 16. As a result, rainfall over a wide area to the south washed out the plume into the soil, leading to a significant increase in the ambient dose rate. This time the decrease in the dose rate was dominated by the radiation decay of the radioactive nuclides. On March 18 and 19, the wind blew toward the North direction, and several dose rate peaks were observed in Minami-sÅma (N 30 km). However, presumably because there was no rainfall, these plumes did not deposit material onto the ground (Fig. 3.8, G). On March 21, although rain fell in Fukushima, the plume did not deposit material onto Minami-sÅma, because the wind was heading south (Fig. 3.8, H). This suggests that ground contamination occurred due to both the plume and rainfall. [South 50â100 km from 1F] Ibaraki prefecture, located south of Fukushima, was subjected to a considerable degree of washout/rainout on March 16 and 20, that can be seen from the increase of the baseline of the ambient dose rate, having a decay timescale of 131I, 8.02 d (Fig. 3.8, I). Just after the delivery of the plume, the decay of the short-lifetime radioactive nucleus was also observed, such as 135I (6.7 h), or 132I in radiative equilibrium with 132Te (78 h) (Fig. 3.8, J). [South >100 km from 1F] In Tokyo, rain on March 21 washed out the plume and increased the radiation dose rate, which led to a minor panic when 131I was detected from the tap water source (Fig. 3.8, K). In Shizuoka, at 360 km from 1F, one can see from the time difference between the rain and the increase in the dose rate that the plume arrived during rainy weather (Fig. 3.8, L). This suggests that the plume remains no longer than a few days when new plumes are not delivered. This speculation agrees with the observation of the radioactive material level of fallout in Tokyo per day [10]. Usually the fallout lasted around 3â4 days in"

230,599,0.903,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Commission 2013a). Plastics account for some 78 % by number of pieces, and 67 % by weight, of washed-up materials on the coasts of the Northwest Pacific Region (Kanehiro 2012). Lightweight plastic bags are particularly prone to becoming marine litter since they are seen by consumers as single-use, are often disposed of carelessly, are frequently not accepted in household recycling collections, and are easily blown by the wind into drains, water courses and the marine environment. During the Ocean Conservancyâs 2013 International Coastal Cleanup,4 6 % of the total litter items found were plastic bags (grocery or other plastic bags) (Ocean Conservancy 2014). In China in 2012, plastic bags comprised 23 % of drifting marine litter found in the sea, and 59 % of that found on beaches (Meng and Chen 2013). In Shanghai, they accounted for between 15 and 29 % of all marine litter items recorded during coastal surveys between 2008 and 2012 (ICC 2013). European Commission guidance for EU Member States on developing waste prevention programs, published in October 2012, suggests that plastic bags can be effectively targeted by waste prevention activities (European Commission 2012). Many countries have already taken specific action to tackle plastic bags: over 30 countries have introduced taxes/fees, and over 30 have introduced bans for singleuse carrier bags, or bans on bags with certain characteristics, such as those made from plastic of less than a certain thickness (Earth Policy Institute 2013). In some countries, there is a mix of bans and charges, since this is an area of policy that is often dealt with at a local or city level. The following paragraphs summarise several of these initiatives, with a focus on those where information is available on their impacts. In Europe, several countries have introduced taxes or charges on single-use (disposable) plastic carrier bags. Denmark has applied a charge for plastic and paper carrier bags since 1993 (the charge depends on the weight and material). The year after the tax was introduced saw an initial reduction in bag use of 60 % (Earth Policy Institute 2013). Ireland introduced a â¬0.15 levy per general purpose plastic bag in 2002, and increased the levy to â¬0.22 in 2007. The levy led to an immediate decrease in plastic bag use from an estimated 328 bags per capita per year to 21 bags per capita. Although per capita consumption increased again to 31 bags during 2006, an increase in the levy in 2007 led to a further reduction to 18 bags in 2010 (Department of Environment Community and Local Government 2013). Plastic bags constituted 0.3 % of litter pollution nationally in 2012 compared to an estimated 5 % in 2001 prior to the introduction of the levy (National Litter Pollution Monitoring System 2013). In 2001 (pre-levy) around 17 plastic bags were found per 500 m of coastline. This figure fell to around 10 bags in 2002 (the year the levy was introduced), 5 bags in 2003, and 2 in 2012 (Doyle and OâHagan 2013). In the U.K., a â¬0.06 levy on the use of single-use carrier bags (plastic and paper) was introduced in Wales in 2011, and in Northern Ireland in 2013; retailers in 4Ocean Conservancyâs (2013) International Coastal Cleanup involved nearly 650,000 volunteers at over 5,500 beach/coastal sites covering a total length of 12,914 miles in 92 countries and locations."

200,77,0.903,"Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Nuclear Risks","The parameters of location, length, strike, dip angle, depth of fault upper edge, and fault width for the earthquake source fault model were determined using the fault distribution and character of the tectonic scarps in the Nakata map. First, the location, length, and strike were determined from the type differences in the Nakata map from ten linear sections with different lengths between 30 and 80 km and the individual strike (Fig. 4.2a) Second, the dip angle and the depth of the fault upper edge were examined by comparing the Nakata map with the seismic profile records (e.g., Kato [3]; Fig. 4.1c). The dip angle of type Y section in the Nakata map corresponds to the decollement of the plate boundary, and the average of 14 W was assigned to the parameters from several seismic profile records ranging from 12 W to 16 W. The depth of the fault upper edge was assigned as 0 km since the decollement of the plate boundary reaches the sea bottom. The dip angles of types A to D sections of high-angle branching faults were assigned as 26 W from several seismic profile records ranging from 25 W to 28 W. The tectonic landforms of these sections display a humped form with a relatively long wavelength of 20 km, and such hump-shaped tectonic landforms have been observed empirically when the upper fault edge was buried beneath the subsurface. Thus, the depth of the fault upper edges of these types was 5 km beneath the tectonic scarps on the sea bottom, as shown in Fig. 4.1c. For the fault width, the parameters of low-angle decollement plane (e.g., Fujii and Satake [5], Fig. 4.2a) for the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake were referred since the high-angle branching faults in this study converged to the decollement of the plate boundary (Fig. 4.1c). Subsequently, the average slip value of 11 m was calculated from the empirical equation of fault area and average displacement given in âA Formula for the Prediction of Strong Ground Motion of Subduction-Type Earthquakesâ [6]. Finally, the slip distribution of 25 sub-faults was assigned using a trial-and-error method under the following four constraint conditions: (1) the total seismic moment is preserved, (2) the maximum slip is almost twice the average slip according to the formula of HERP [6], (3) the area of maximum slip is almost 20 % of the total fault area according to the formula of HERP [6], and (4) the slip distribution of the section of decollement is close to that of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake since our model shared the deep part of the low-angle fault plane with that of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake as the decollement of the plate boundary. The resulting model parameters (Model1) are summarized in Table 4.1 and Fig. 4.2b. The amount of slip and the area of the asperity of the formula [6] were"

Specifically, as wetness values increase, the differences between the observed surface temperature and the observed channel measurements also increase (Williams et al. 2000). Weekly and monthly average BWI values are very good indicators of the magnitude of water near the surface, which has a relationship to water at greater depths. These observations have proven valuable in agricultural monitoring during the previous 25 years of analytical work. The wetness anomalies have proven valuable in predicting agricultural yields in many areas of the world (Curt Reynold USDA, personal correspondence). Research indicates the wetness product has a gamma distribution, much like precipitation (Gutman 1999); therefore a gamma distribution is used to derive the variation of wetness from the expected value. Since most regions of the world have annual cycles associated with their liquid water near the surface, it is best to calculate anomalies for each pixel, location and time of year. The resolution of the pixel is 33 km by 33 km, and anomalies are calculated on a monthly and weekly basis. A value of 0.01 means that only 1 year in a 100 would realize a value so low (extremely dry) at the location for a particular time of year. Conversely, a value of 0.99 corresponds with an excessively wet event that only occurs one out of a 100 years. In summary, values progressively less than 0.5 indicate increasingly drier conditions and values progressively greater than 0.5 indicate increasingly wetter conditions than the expected value (Fig. 1). The period of record for these wetness and temperature products begins in 1988 and they have been maintained in near real time for decades.1 There is a period of 2 years, 1990 and 1991, when the stability of the microwave satellite instrument was deemed unreliable. Therefore, these 2 years are removed from the analysis. The climatology we use is based on the 23 years of data from 1988 to 2010. A series of operational satellite instruments flown by the United States Meteorological Satellite Service comprise the period of observations. Great effort has been made to seam the observations between the various satellite instruments into one contiguous record. A daily set of observations is composed of 14 orbits across the globe. These observations are sun synchronous over the equator, at an overpass time around 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day. The morning and afternoon overpasses are processed independently and then combined together into one set of observations across the globe. Each set of observations is added to this record in near real-time, as both weekly and monthly fields of temperature and wetness values."

In 2012, over 13,300 taxis in New York City made over 15 million trips a month or 500,000 trips a day, with around 85 percent of trips within Manhattan. The study uses taxi trip data collected on March 1, 2012 (the data is courtesy of the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission) consisting of 439,950 trips within Manhattan. First, trip origins and destinations are clustered into N = 100 stations, so that a customer is on average less than 300 m from the nearest station, or approximately a 3-minute walk. The system parameters such as arrival rates {Èi}, destination preferences {pi j} and travel times {Ti j} are estimated for each hour of the day using trip data between each pair of stations. Vehicle availability (i.e., probability of finding a vehicle when walking to a station) is calculated for three cases â peak demand (29,485 demands/hour, 7â8 pm), low demand (1,982 demands/hour, 4â5 am), and average demand (16,930 demands/hour, 4â5 pm). For each case, vehicle availability is calculated by solving the linear program discussed in Section 19.2.2.1 and then applying mean value analysis [29] techniques to recover vehicle availabilities.

Peak values were 6.6 Ã 105 Bq/l at site-FP, 2.4 Ã 104 Bq/l at site-F1, and 1.4 Ã 103 Bq/l at site-F2; values this high have never before been observed in the marine environment (Tsumune et al. 2012; Baxter and Camplin 1993; IAEA 2005; HELCOM 2009). Accumulated values for the period from March 21, 2011 to July 31, 2012, when the fat greenling was thought to be affected by contamination off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, were as high as 5.4 Ã 106 Bq/l at site-FP, 2.2 Ã 105 Bq/l at site-F1, and 1.8 Ã 104 Bq/l at site-F2. These accumulated values were indicative of the direct load of radioactivity in the ecosystem at each site. In addition, accumulation curves of 137Cs concentrations of each sites indicated sharp increase during the early days and reached 90 % of accumulated values of July 31, 2012 in first 20 (site-FP), 21 (site-F1), and 45 (site-F2) days. Cs concentration data for fat greenlings in the coastal waters of Fukushima Prefecture were extracted from the dataset published by MHLW (2014) and from TEPCO data reports for the 20-km area and the FNPP port (TEPCO 2014a). Timeseries for fat greenlings in the coastal waters of Fukushima and for the 20-km area indicate similar decreasing trends beginning in the spring of 2012 (Fig. 13.3). The median and the 95th percentile values were calculated from the combined data set of both for each 6-month period beginning March 1, 2011. Ecological half-lives calculated from these values for the period from March 2012 to August 2014 were 175 days for 95th percentile and 194 days for median. The values were slightly lower than the results for fat greenlings (217 days) collected from the southern area off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture between August 2011 and September 2012 (Tateda et al. 2013). The difference reflected the variation in analytical period."

As early as 1991, an experiment employed a recirculating-loop conï¬guration to demonstrate the possibility of data transmission in this manner over 14,300 km at 5 Gbit/s. This experiment indicated that an all-optical, submarine transmission system was feasible for intercontinental communication. The TATâ12 cable, installed in 1995, employed optical ampliï¬ers in place of in-line regenerators and operated at a bit rate of 5.3 Gbit/s with an ampliï¬er spacing of about 50 km. The actual bit rate was slightly larger than the data rate of 5 Gbit/ s because of the overhead associated with the forward-error correction that was necessary for the system to work. The design of such lightwave systems becomes quite complex because of the cumulative effects of ï¬ber dispersion and nonlinearity, which must be controlled over long distances. The use of the WDM technique after 1996 in combination with optical ampliï¬ers, dispersion management, and error correction revolutionized the design of submarine ï¬ber-optic systems. In 1998, a submarine cable known as ACâ1 was deployed across the Atlantic Ocean with a capacity of 80 Gb/s using the WDM technology. An identically designed system (PCâ1) crossed the Paciï¬c Ocean. The use of dense WDM, in combination with multiple ï¬ber pairs per cable, resulted in systems with large capacities. After 2000, several submarine systems with a capacity of more than 1 Tbit/s became operational (see . Table 8.2 ). . Figure 8.17 shows the international submarine cable network of ï¬ber-optic communication systems. The VSNL transatlantic submarine system installed in 2001 had a total capacity of 2.56 Tbit/s and spans a total distance of 13,000 km. A submarine"

The pH value of the ASW was 7.3 before autoclaving and 8.1 afterwards. To simulate the low concentrations of organic compounds found in deep seawater, Bacto yeast extract (BD Difco, NJ, USA) was added from an autoclaved stock solution to render the concentration to be 10 mg (corresponding to 3.3 mg of carbon) L 1 in the final medium as described previously (Jannasch et al. 1996)."
