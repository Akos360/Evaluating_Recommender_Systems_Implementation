Japan was historically the major importer of tortoiseshell or bekko from the Caribbean (NMFS and USFWS 1993). They agreed to stop importing bekko in 1993 (USFWS 2012). Although the volume of international trade has declined significantly in the past 20 years, it remains active, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas (Mortimer 2008). In Southeast Asia, the extensive practice of selling whole, stuffed hawksbills is a relatively new threat (Mortimer 2008). Hawksbills are the most tropical of the sea turtle species and typically nest at low densities throughout their range (NMFS and USFWS 1993, 2007e). In the past, hawksbill sea turtles were considered to be naturally rare and to have a more dispersed nesting pattern than the other sea turtle species (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). However, the dispersed pattern currently observed is now believed to be the result of overexploitation of previously large colonies (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Hawksbill sea turtles are often associated with coral reefs (Meylan 1988; Meylan and Redlow 2006). There are many gaps in the understanding of hawksbill sea turtle biology, and the oceanic phase of the post-hatchlings remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of hawksbill life history (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Because of an almost total lack of long-term trend data at hawksbill foraging sites, nesting beach data are the primary information source used to evaluate trends in hawksbill populations. Few data are available on the at-sea mortality of hawksbills in fisheries (NMFS and USFWS 2007e)."
246,305,0.991,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Danube Delta: Europeâs Unrivalled Wetland The Danube Delta on the border between Romania and Ukraine is outstanding in Europeâdue to its size (over 600,000 ha), intact river dynamics, unexploited coastline (shaped by the Danube River and the Black Sea together), wide horizons and large-scale landscapes without significant infrastructure (Fig. 9.7). It also has the largest reed beds in the world, in addition to millions of nesting and migrating birds, many of them rare and some even globally endangered. However, some of the key wildlife species are still missing, such as wolf, red deer and beaver. Due to poisoning, numbers of species like black kites ( Milvus migrans), golden jackals ( Canis aureus) or vultures are extremely low. Apart from legal enforcement, giving value to these species as part of the wildlife watching economy should stimulate social control to avoid these illegal practices."

Despite the data gaps and limitations associated with specific datasets, the current conditions of the five species of sea turtles that occur in the Gulf of Mexico have been described qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively. Kempâs Ridley Sea Turtles. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Kempâs ridley sea turtle has made a remarkable recovery from the brink of extinction (Heppell et al. 2007; Crowder and Heppell 2011), although the current nesting populations remain far below historical levels. The increased abundance and nesting of Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years is most likely a result of many activities that affect all Kempâs ridley life stagesâconservation and education efforts in both Mexico and the United States, the Kempâs Ridley Recovery Program, the Kempâs Ridley Head Start Experiment, the elimination of direct harvest of eggs and adult turtles, nest and hatchling protection, TED use, shrimp fishery closures, and the reduced Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawling effort in both the United States and Mexico (Shaver and Wibbels 2007; NMFS et al. 2011; Crowder and Heppell 2011). Despite the partial success story, there are threats to Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf that could cause significant impacts to the population and affect its continued recovery, particularly the incidental bycatch. The future of Kempâs ridleys is optimistically bright, and nesting numbers at Rancho Nuevo and PAIS continue to increase; however, because of their mass nesting at a single site in the western Gulf and their restricted Gulf of Mexico distribution, a significant event or the synergistic effects of multiple threats in the Gulf could have catastrophic effects on the recovering Kempâs ridley population. Loggerhead Sea Turtles. The life history, distribution, and abundance of the loggerhead sea turtle is probably better understood than all other sea turtle species that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico (Bolten and Witherington 2003; USFWS and NMFS 2011). While the loggerhead is distributed globally, the goal of this chapter was to describe contemporary conditions of Gulf sea turtles; information for populations that occur in the Gulf of Mexico during some portion of their life cycle was the focus. These populations included the Peninsular Florida, northern Gulf of Mexico, Dry Tortugas, and Greater Caribbean subpopulations of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (USFWS and NMFS 2011). The annual nest counts from 2001 through 2009 on Florida Gulf coast and Atlantic beaches showed a decreasing trend, but in 2010 and 2011, loggerhead nest counts on surveyed Florida beaches were back to numbers similar to those recorded in 2000, indicating that the population of nesting females may have stabilized. Given the lack of a long historical record, it is not known whether these types of fluctuations are common or if the recent temporary decrease observed was caused by an acute factor. A recent analysis of annual loggerhead nest counts for the northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation indicated a significant declining trend; however, a longer time series of nesting data is needed for an adequate evaluation (NMFS and USFWS 2008). More years of data are also needed in order to detect a trend in loggerhead nest counts for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation. Nesting for the Greater Caribbean subpopulation appears to be stable; however, a trend analysis is challenging because standardized surveys are few, survey efforts have changed, and low-level nesting occurs in many locations (NMFS and USFWS 2008). High cumulative anthropogenic threat levels were estimated for oceanic and neritic juveniles and adults of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS during the most recent loggerhead status review (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011). The loggerhead mortalities associated with these high threat levels resulted primarily from fisheries bycatch. Significant loggerhead mortality occurred in longline fisheries, bottom and mid-water trawl fisheries, dredge fisheries, gillnet fisheries, and pot/trap fisheries that occur not only in U.S. waters (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011; Ponwith 2011), but also in the Azores, the Mediterranean, on the Grand Banks, in Canadian waters, and in other locations throughout the range of the northwest Atlantic Ocean"
34,929,0.99,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","it clear that the highest species diversity is in the southern Gulf, along the YucataÌn Peninsula (although not in the sector with Cuba). A number of non-Passerine species (N Â¼ 93) occurred in all 12 sectors of the Gulf of Mexico (Table 12.4). Only the non-Passerines are listed because they are more typical of the species that inhabit the coastal and marine areas. The non-Passerines that are distributed throughout the Gulf include ducks, grebes, loons, boobies, pelicans, herons, egrets, ibises, spoonbills, storks, rails, shorebirds, gulls, terns, skimmers, and a kingfisher. As might be expected, shorebirds (N Â¼ 31 species), ducks (N Â¼ 10 species), herons and egrets (N Â¼ 10), and gulls and terns (N Â¼ 13) are the most diverse groups. Scientific names in Table 12.4 are not repeated in the text that follows this section. While the non-Passerines are normally considered the key avian component of the Gulf, Passerines are important because millions migrate around or over the Gulf each spring and fall, and others reside in the coastal environment (e.g., Seaside Sparrows, Moore 2000b). Although Gallardo et al. (2009) lists Passerine species found throughout the Gulf, their list is necessarily incomplete because the marsh, shrub, and forest habitats are continuous landward, and it is difficult to draw a suitable line for which species to include. Moreover, the distribution of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants along the southern Gulf of Mexico may be less well known than the distribution along the northern Gulf coast. Some raptors that prey on migrants may be"
34,348,0.989,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","9.4.4 Large Coastal Sharks Group Currently, the Large Coastal Sharks group consists of 11 shark species that are widely distributed throughout the world (SEDAR 29 2012). In the western Atlantic Ocean, they can be found from along the U.S. Atlantic coast all the way to the south of Brazil. All of the Large Coastal Sharks can be found in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). They are considered either as part of the South Atlantic stock or as an independent stock in the assessment and management. Most species of Large Coastal Sharks use the inshore shallow waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico as their spawning and nursery grounds. They tend to move into the inshore shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico during the spring to give birth to their offspring. The inshore shallow waters provide refuges for their newborn offspring from potential predators (usually large sharks). The young sharks spend summers in the inshore waters for feeding. The preferred bottoms range from sand to mud to seagrass. Young-of-the-year sharks tend to occur more frequently in shallower water with higher temperatures, lower salinities, and more turbid conditions compared to the habitats for juveniles and adults. Small and young sharks may select these habitats as a refuge from larger and more active predators (Bethea et al. 2009). Most sharks move into warmer offshore waters in the fall. Compared to species of Small Coastal Sharks, most of the Large Coastal Sharks tend to become sexually mature at a later age. The Large Coastal Sharks group supports several important commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). Although most species are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, most stock abundances have been reduced over time. The catch quota for the Large Coastal Sharks stocks has been reduced continuously over time since the 1990s but has become relatively stable since the mid-2000s (Figure 9.75), perhaps reflecting a stabilized Large Coastal Sharks group. Sandbar and blacktip sharks are two of the most abundant and most commercially and recreationally important shark species in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). They both belong to the Large Coastal Sharks group and are widely distributed in the Gulf of Mexico. As top predators that are abundant in Gulf of Mexico coastal ecosystems, sandbar and blacktip sharks play an important role in regulating the ecosystem dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico; therefore, they were selected as representative species for evaluation."
230,118,0.988,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract In this review we report new findings concerning interaction between marine debris and wildlife. Deleterious effects and consequences of entanglement, consumption and smothering are highlighted and discussed. The number of species known to have been affected by either entanglement or ingestion of plastic debris has doubled since 1997, from 267 to 557 species among all groups of wildlife. For marine turtles the number of affected species increased from 86 to 100 % (now 7 of 7 species), for marine mammals from 43 to 66 % (now 81 of 123 species) and for seabirds from 44 to 50 % of species (now 203 of 406 species). Strong increases in records were also listed for fish and invertebrates, groups that were previously not considered in detail. In future records of interactions between marine debris and wildlife we recommend to focus on standardized data on frequency of occurrence and quantities of debris ingested. In combination with dedicated impact studies in the wild or experiments, this will allow more detailed assessments of the deleterious effects of marine debris on individuals and populations.

34,804,0.988,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Similar to other species of sea turtles, hatchling hawksbills enter an oceanic phase (Figure 11.44). This phase may involve long-distance travel carried by surface gyres, with eventual recruitment to neritic foraging habitat (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Hatchlings entrained in the Loop Current could be expected to remain in the Gulf of Mexico for differing periods of time, depending on which branch of the Loop Current they enter (Meylan and Redlow 2006). Both newly hatched and early juvenile hawksbills have been found in association with Sargassum and floating weed in the Atlantic and Caribbean (Table 11.5) (Carr 1987; Mellgren and Mann 1996; Musick and Limpus 1997; Meylan and Redlow 2006). No post-hatchlings but six juvenile hawksbill sea turtles, with an average size of 20.6 cm (8.1 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated, surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean from 2005 through 2011; some of these hawksbills were large enough to be on the cusp of recruitment into the neritic zone, most likely to foraging habitat in the Florida Keys (Witherington et al. 2012). Weedlines in the Gulf of Mexico likely serve as habitat for posthatchling hawksbills from nesting beaches in Mexico and Central America (NMFS and USFWS 1993). Between 1972 and 1984, 77 strandings of post-hatchling and juvenile hawksbills were recorded in Texas, with most occurring near Corpus Christi; these turtles most likely originated from nesting beaches on the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico (Amos 1989; Bowen et al. 2007). Limited tagging data indicates that some post-hatchling hawksbills from the western Gulf of Mexico disperse into the Atlantic Ocean, most likely through the Florida Straits, and move northward along Floridaâs east coast (Meylan and Redlow 2006)."
255,54,0.988,Railway Ecology,"Hels and Buchwald 2001; Carvalho and Mira 2011), records for railways are much rarer (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998). Unfortunately, there are no studies that compare detectability and persistence rates of carcasses between road and railway surveys, so the difference in numbers remains an open question. Considering only the studies that aimed to survey train casualties of all species, the frequency of amphibians can reach up to 47% of all vertebrate records (Heske 2015), while the records of reptiles represent ca. 4% (Spain) and 6% (USA) of carcasses (Heske 2015; SCV 1996). In Netherlands, for example, no carcasses of amphibians or reptiles were ever found (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998), while in Spain, only reptiles were recorded (SCV 1996). In Chicago state, USA, amphibians were the most abundant taxonomic group recorded in train collisions (Heske 2015), mainly northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and American toads (Bufo americanus), common species in the region. Mortalities of amphibians were particularly high after rain events, when these species are most active and are also frequently found dead on the roads (Heske 2015). Budzic and Budzic (2014) conducted a survey speciï¬cally aimed to estimate amphibian mortality on 34 km of Polish railways. They found that three species were most affected by train accidents: the common toad (Bufo bufo), the common frog (Rana temporaria) and the green frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus), and most of dead individuals (77%) were adult common toads. Although mortality rates can be high, all three species are considered common in Europe. In fact, two of the species affected by railway mortality (common toad and common frog), are among the most common European amphibians, for which there is also evidence of high road-mortality (Hels and Buchwald 2001; Matos et al. 2012; OrÅowski 2007). As in roads, the spring migration (or autumn migration, in some regions) seems to be the period of highest amphibian mortality on railway tracks, as 87% of all accidents occurred in that season (Budzic and Budzic 2014). Yet, railway mortality of amphibians seems to depend on animalsâ physical features (such as body size and limb length) and should be associated with the agility of the species (Budzic and Budzic 2014). While in the case of roads, the velocity of individuals is used as a proxy for agility (Hels and Buchwald 2001), in the case of railway tracks, agility relates mainly to the ability to overcome obstacles (Budzic and Budzic 2014; SCV 1996). Due to its physical features, the common toad was more likely to become trapped between rails, indicating that this species (and others with similar physical features) may be more vulnerable to railway mortality (Budzic and Budzic 2014). Some species of small size may be less vulnerable because they cannot cross the rail track (Heske 2015). However, they may be affected by railways at the level of gene flow due to barrier effects (Holderegger and Di Giulio 2010), which may be also a conservation problem. Concerning reptile mortality, 13 snakes (4%) were recorded across the whole Spanish railway network between 1990 and 1995. Only two species were identiï¬ed: the ladder snake (Elaphe scalaris) and the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), both common reptiles in the country (SCV 1996). The railway bed may be lethal itself for smaller animals that can become trapped between the rails, where they may be susceptible to predation or physiological"
233,547,0.988,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Results We found 40 Least Concern and Data Deï¬cient species that possess a high combined score of Î»M and ED (see Table 1). In total, 42 of the island mammal species we assessed were listed by the IUCN as Data Deï¬cient, 47 as Least Concern, with the remainder as threatened species. Those species already listed as threatened were potentially suffering from other threats (e.g. non-native species as predators/competitors). Focusing on those species that are Data Deï¬cient or Least Concern and have higher Î»M-ED scores would be most beneï¬cial, as their rarity indicate them to be at risk and a high Î»M value represents an important patch, and one that would pay off greatly to conserve. The ï¬ve islands with the highest average Î»M-ED scores, taken by adding all the scores and dividing by our (island-restricted mammals) species richness per island were Jamaica, Guadalcanal, Isle of Pines, Madagascar, and Nggela Sule (see Table 2, Fig. 3 for map). Interestingly, Madagascar held 39 of the highest Î»M-ED species, and ranked fourth in our Î»M-ED islands list. We found that combining evolutionary distinctness with Î»M revealed species that may be of concern that were not otherwise noticed. Because quantifying fragmentation effects on species takes into account spatial conï¬guration, this can help to improve threat status assessments. The EDGE programme has already sought to visualize regions in the world with the most rare species and moved to prioritize those particular species. This adds a spatial understanding of the species distribution to that prioritization."

Most populations or subpopulations have not been well studied, with the most notable exceptions being those of the Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida, area (Wells 2003) and Sanibel Island (Shane 2004) of west Florida. Similarly, dolphin populations are known in the north-central Gulf (Mullin 1988) and off Texas (Shane 1977; Moreno 2005) as well, but none has been followed for as long or as thoroughly as the subject of the Wells (2003) study. Bottlenose dolphins of the inshore areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico number about 28â32 separate stocks (that are not necessarily distinguished as genetic populations), with an estimated total of 5,355 (no reliable CV available) animals (Table 13.22). Three coastal stocks outside of bays and estuaries and up to 20 m (66 ft) deep, total approximately 13,600 animals (see details, below). The northern continental shelf stock between 20 m and 200 m (66 ft and 656 ft) totals about 17,777 (CV 0.32). The northern oceanic stock deeper than 200 m (656 ft) totals about 3,708 (CV 0.42). Details of these groupings are given below. Anthropogenic influences on this species will be discussed, including toxins, noises, and other aspects, since more is known about these dolphins and their ecology than is known about other cetaceans in the Gulf, largely due to work by Randall Wells and colleagues, which is summarized in Reynolds et al.

34,922,0.987,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","12.3 LAND-WATER INTERFACE Land-water interfaces usually have high species diversity and high biomass because they contain a range of different habitats. Habitats are intermixed in different patch sizes, and the interface serves as the gateway for movement into both aquatic and terrestrial environments. While it is impossible to clearly define the coastal zone, functionally it is the area on either side of the actual meeting of the land and ocean that is influenced by both marine and terrestrial inputs. The margins themselves are usually narrow, providing an opportunity for animals to move quickly from one habitat to another (Burger 1991a). Since these characteristics apply to both plant and invertebrate communities, the diversity is amplified in higher trophic levels, such as fish, birds, and mammals. The land-water interface also serves as a physical buffer for both the marine ecosystem and for the terrestrial system. Estuarine and coastal environments protect inland terrestrial habitats from excessively high tides, hurricanes, erosion, and other severe storm events, while protecting marine environments from contamination by providing a sink for contaminants. The margin constantly changes due to the effects of wind and water. Because it is large, the Gulf of Mexico has a long coastline with a wide range of habitats. Because of its geographical position, it has a diversity of habitats that extend from tropical to temperate and from coastal to offshore islands. The Gulf serves as a conduit or migration route to southern wintering grounds between the United States (and more northern Canada) and Mexico, Central America, and South America (Gallardo et al. 2004). The land mass to the north is larger and serves as a funnel point for birds scattered across North America that are migrating to wintering grounds along the Gulf of Mexico or farther south. Most of the birds of the Gulf of Mexico are tied to the coastal zone because of breeding constraints and foraging opportunities. Gallardo et al. (2009) lists 395 species in 53 families as the number of bird species in the Gulf region. The main families in the Gulf are ducks (Anatidae, 46 species), gulls, terns and skimmers (Laridae, N Â¼ 41), herons and egrets (Ardeidae, N Â¼ 17), rails (Rallidae, N Â¼ 16), warblers (Parulidae, N Â¼ 36), and flycatchers (Tyrannidae, N Â¼ 17). The latter two groups are Passerines, but they frequently occur on coastal islands, on marshes, and in coastal forest habitats either as migrants or during the breeding season (Moore et al. 1990; Buler et al. 2007; Buler and Moore 2011). For a full list of the species, see Gallardo et al. (2009). Coasts are impacted by weather and storm events, as well as anthropogenic factors, such as alteration of hydrological processes, introduction of toxic chemicals and nutrients, increased human population density, increased fishing and other commercial enterprises, development of wind energy, increased numbers of oil and gas platforms, and direct human disturbance. Half of the continental U.S. population resides within 50 mile of the coasts, making them the most rapidly growing areas in the United States. From the 1960s to 2015, the population density of all Gulf coastal counties is expected to increase from 187 to 327 people per square mile (NOAA 1998). Condominiums, resorts, casinos, and other commercial and industrial development already characterize large expanses of the northern Gulf Coast.

246,130,0.987,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Eurasian Lynx The total number of lynx in Europe is estimated to be 9000-10,000 individuals. They occur in 23 countries divided into 10 main populations (Fig. 4.3): five of these ten populations are autochthonous (Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian and Balkan), the other populations stem from reintroductions in the 1970s and 1980s (Dinaric, Alpine, Jura, Vosges-Palatinian and Bohemian- Bavarian) (Linnell et al. 2009). Of the autochthonous populations, only the Balkan one is of conservation concern, having been reduced to about 40â50 individuals and showing no signs of significant recovery. The reintroduced populations are all small in the range of 20 individuals in the Vosges-Palatinian to about 150 in the Alpine population. In addition, lynx roam the Harz Mountains of central Germany because of recent reintroductions. The general trend in numbers is stable or slightly increasing, although there is some concern for the long-term viability of the reintroduced populations due to small population effects and the risk of inbreeding. Most of the lynx populations are strictly protected and derogations under article 16 of the Habitats Directive are used to harvest the populations in Sweden, Latvia and Finland. Estonia is unique within the EU having the lynx on annex V, which permits regulated harvest as a game species. Large conflicts with livestock owners are limited to the northern populations. The only country with a major conflict with sheep is Norway, where about 7000â 10,000 sheep are compensated annually. In addition, thousands of semi-domestic reindeer deaths are attributed to lynx depredation annually in Norway, Sweden and Finland. Elsewhere the level of livestock depredation is very small. However, the level of conflict with hunters is widespread across Europe who perceive lynx as a competitor for wild ungulates, especially roe deer (Breitenmoser et al. 2010)."
36,450,0.987,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"11.4 Offshore Wind Facilities Potential impacts of offshore wind-energy development on bats are poorly understood, although observations in Europe and anecdotal accounts of bats occurring offshore suggest that impacts may occur. Bats are known to regularly migrate across the Baltic and North Seas and visit offshore facilities (Hutterer et al. 2005; Boshamer and Bekker 2008; AhlÃ©n et al. 2009; Poerink et al. 2013; Rydell et al. 2014). AhlÃ©n et al. (2009) recorded 11 species of bats flying and feeding over the sea up to 14 km from the shore. In spring and late summer, migrating bats are found along coastlines of the Baltic Sea and southeastern North Sea in northern Europe, including all offshore islands where observations have been made (Rydell et al. 2014). This suggests bats, including Nathusiusâ pipistrelles, soprano pipistrelles, and common noctules, migrate on a broad front across the Baltic Sea and along its coasts, using small islands for stopovers. Researchers in North America also have reported activity of bats in both near and offshore habitats, suggesting impacts are highly probable at facilities located in such places. Cryan and Brown (2007) discovered longitudinal movement by hoary bats from inland summer ranges to coastal regions during autumn and winter and suggested that coastal regions with non-freezing temperatures may be important wintering areas for hoary bats. Off the coast of Maryland, Johnson et al. (2011) recorded five species of bats, including eastern red bats, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), hoary bats, tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and silver-haired bats, on a barrier island and concluded these species used this island during migration, which could have implications for wind energy development near and offshore. It seems likely that near and offshore wind facilities also will kill bats, but it is difficult or impossible to find bat fatalities at sea and no attempts to assess offshore turbine bat fatality have been made to date. Arnett and Baerwald (2013) suggested that impacts of the first several offshore wind-energy facilities proposed and built in North America, including those on inland waters such as the Great Lakes, be evaluated extensively both for fatalities and displacement effects."
36,187,0.987,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"to this issue was one on the effects of salvage logging (see Sect. 4.1.4). This is especially concerning given the strict protection afforded to all bat species and particularly bat roosts under the EU Habitat Directive; this prohibits deliberate disturbance of all bats during any stage of their life cycle as well as the destruction of breeding sites or resting areas. As such, the timing of forest harvesting needs to consider whether bats may be roosting in targeted areas (e.g. Forestry Commission 2005). There are no such restrictions in Australia; though for New Zealand pine plantations, Borkin et al. (2011) recommends that harvests should be planned when bats are not heavily pregnant nor have non-volant dependents. In eastern North America, logging is currently restricted from 15 October through 31 March across the distribution of the endangered Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, as this bat uses live and dead trees as maternity sites during the growing season (USFWS 2009). Restrictions are further constrained to a start date of 15 November within 16 km of known hibernacula of the species (USFWS 2009). The implications of white-nose syndrome and the extensive mortalities of cave-hibernating bats in North America (USFWS 2012) are likely to add species of forest bats to the threatened and endangered species list in the USA, leading to further restrictions on logging. Missing in all of the dialogue, however, is any direct link of impact, or mortality of bats, during logging operations and studies of these potential impacts are needed (but see Borkin et al. 2011)."
34,525,0.986,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","The Gulf of Mexico is host to a large number of reef fish species, many of which represent income generators to the commercial fishing sector. Given the susceptibility of many of the species to overfishing in conjunction with their popularity by the commercial and recreational sectors, the GMFMC is considerably involved in the management of reef fish species. Management of reef fish species with respect to the commercial sector has historically included sector quotas, size and trip limits, closed seasons, limited entry, and, more recently, the introduction of catch shares (previously called individual fishing quotas). The introduction of catch shares, as discussed in more detail below, constitutes a major shift in management regime and one that is likely to become more prevalent over time. Following the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan (GMFMC 1981) and related amendments, Gulf of Mexico reef fish can be broadly classified into six groups: snappers, groupers, tilefish, jacks, amberjacks, and triggerfish.

The reasons behind the importation of species are varied, and include farming, forestry, livestock, ornamental plants and pets, laboratory testing or biocontrol. In some situations, the goal is purposely the formation of wild populations, as is the case of gaming and ï¬shing or biocontrol agents. In other cases, the imported species are to be stored in enclosed environments, but they often escape from captivity. For instance, the American mink (Neovison vison) has invaded many European countries due to accidental escape or deliberate release from fur farms (Vidal-Figueroa and Delibes 1987; Bonesi and Palazon 2007). It is worrisome that a great number of problematic invaders is still actively marketed today, including freshwater macroinvertebrates and ï¬sh (Capinha et al. 2013; Consuegra et al. 2011) and plants (Humair et al. 2015). Trading activities may also lead to the arrival of non-native species as an accidental âby-productâ of a commodity, such as a commensal, a parasite or a disease. These species can remain undetected for long periods of time and may beneï¬t from measures towards the establishment to their hosts in the wild. An illustrative example of such by-products of a traded commodity is the crayï¬sh plague (Aphanomyces astaci) in Europe. This fungus-like disease is hosted by several North American crayï¬sh species that were introduced in European wetlands in order to boost the wild stocks of this food item. However, unlike for North American species that co-evolved with the disease, the crayï¬sh plague is deadly to European species and has already caused numerous extinctions of local populations (Capinha et al. 2013). Stowaway species can be associated with trading activities or any other activity that involves a transportation vehicle. In other words, a non-native stowaway species is not speciï¬c to a particular commodity, and it can be any organism that at some point is displaced by a vehicle or its load. This occurs more often with species that are difï¬cult to detect, such as those that are small or stealthy. Known examples of these stowaway species include land snails attached to trains or their cargo (PeltanovÃ¡ et al. 2011), plankton in shipâs ballast waters (Hulme et al. 2008), or seeds in soil attached to automobiles (Hodkinson and Thompson 1997). Centers of human and commodity transportation and nearby areas (e.g. seaports and railroad stations and yards) often provide the ï¬rst records of non-native stowaways (e.g. Noma et al. 2010) and can host diverse communities of invasive species (Drake and Lodge 2004). Finally, transport infrastructures may also act as âcorridorsâ for the natural dispersal of non-native biodiversity. These infrastructures facilitate the dispersal of non-native organisms by allowing their movement across physical and environmental barriers (e.g. a mountain range now crossed by a tunnel), or by supplying suitable habitat for expanding invasive populations. Concerning the latter case, a few characteristics of the areas managed by transportation companies (e.g. road and railway verges) are considered beneï¬cial to the establishment of non-native species, particularly the regular occurrence of disturbance that gives rise to âvacantâ niches"
38,247,0.986,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Light traps are commonly used for collecting insects as a means for monitoring pest species. The American Center for Disease Control has had a standardised light trap for mosquito monitoring for over 50 years (Sudia and Chamberlain 1988). Moths, beetles and other crop pests are also commonly surveyed this way (Szentkiralyi 2002). However, light traps have a shorter history of use in the aquatic environment. The earliest uses were in freshwater for capturing insects and they were soon found to be excellent for collecting young ï¬sh (Hungerford et al. 1955) and zooplankton (Meekan et al. 2001; Ãresland 2007), but also collect many benthic species that emerge from the benthos at night. They have been used extensively around coral reefs where the structural complexity of the reef system makes other methods susceptible to damage (Doherty 1987). There can be species, gender and ontogenetic speciï¬c responses to light traps making them more useful for some organisms than others. Species may vary in their abundance at different times of the night and lunar cycle. A beneï¬t of light-trapping is that the animals are not harmed during collection, and have thus proved useful for sampling of museum specimens and laboratory animals (Doherty 1987; Holmes and OâConnor 1988). However, light trap catches may not work well in areas of high current or excessive turbidity. The potential of light traps for monitoring mobile benthic and demersal organisms, mostly crustaceans, has yet to be adequately explored. This âï¬sh foodâ component of biodiversity forms an important trophic link in many ecosystems, and has been overlooked in marine biodiversity monitoring."

Studies by Randall S. Wells and colleagues describe the long-term structure and stability of bottlenose dolphin residents of greater Sarasota Bay, Florida, since 1970 (Irvine and Wells 1972; Scott et al. 1990; Wells 1991, 2003). By photo-identification and periodic captures for age, reproductive, and health data, presently five generations have been tracked in the area, including several first seen in the 1970s that are still living. Estimated immigration and emigration rates are about 2â3 % (Wells and Scott 1990). However, while it is rather stable and almost all individuals remain, this is not a wholly isolated, genetically closed population, and at least some calves were sired by nonresidents (Duffield and Wells 2002). While yearround residents occur in other areas as well, at least some animals can move quite long distances, as nearshore animals have been identified up to several 100 km away in Texas waters (Lynn and Wâ¬ ursig 2002). There is some aspect of seasonality as well. In smaller bays such as Sarasota, Florida, and San Luis Pass, Texas, some residents move into Gulf coastal waters during fall and winter and return inshore in spring and summer (Irvine et al. 1981; Maze and ursig 1999, respectively). In larger bays, there may be even more seasonal migrations, as there is a tendency for greater numbers in northerly bays in summer and southerly bays in winter (e.g., Tampa Bay, Florida, Scott et al. 1989; and Galveston Bay, Texas, BraÌger et al. 1994). The above data must not obscure the fact that most bottlenose dolphin populations or communities of the Gulf are not thoroughly described, and much more information is needed for proper identifications and numbers. Only four populations are sufficiently well known with data from the past 8 years or less for reliable numbers estimates: Sarasota Bay (160 animals, direct count), Choctawhatchee Bay (179 animals, best estimate), Apalachicola Bay (537 animals, best estimate), and St. Joseph Bay (146 animals, best estimate).

233,528,0.986,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"survey coverage, whether coastal or oceanic, is very limited (Jewell et al. 2012). Less than 25 % of the ocean surface has been surveyed and only 6 % has been covered frequently enough to allow estimations of population trends (Kaschner et al. 2012). In addition, spatial coverage is also signiï¬cantly biased towards some ocean basins. Karchner et al. (2012) reported that with the exception of Antarctic waters, survey coverage was biased toward the northern hemisphere, especially US and northern European waters, which may explain the consensus among methods identifying the Aleutian and Hawaiian Islands as CPAs. Nevertheless, despite this potential data bias most CPAs were found in the southern hemisphere, suggesting that phylogenetic conservation priority methods do not simply reï¬ect sampling effort, but identify areas that contain aquatic mammal communities including both evolutionarily unique species and those at risk. As we discussed in our methods, CPAs were the result from the cumulative values for each metric in each cell. Thus CPAs may reï¬ect a large number of species varying in conservation priority values or possibly only a few species with high values. The later seems to be the case for Hawaii, Nouadhibou, Madeira Island, Yangtze river, and Southern Brazil-Argentina where highly evolutionary unique species are endemic to those areas (Table 2). Other CPAs such as California, Southern Australia and New Zealand include many species, but only some of which are evolutionarily unique species. These areas are part of ranges of several species with very broad distribution ranges such as the sperm whale, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales, and blue whale. Interestingly, previous studies that have used species richness to identify âhotspotâ of aquatic mammal diversity (Pompa et al. 2011) and a combination of levels of imperilment with intrinsic and extrinsic factors to identify high risk areas for aquatic mammals (Davidson et al. 2011) agree with the CPAs identiï¬ed here. Davidson et al. (2011) identiï¬ed ï¬ve major global hotspots of marine mammal species at risk. Within these major hotpots several locations overlap with those found in this study: Aleutian Islands, Alaska, California, Galapagos, Patagonia, South Africa, Japan, Indonesia, South Australia, and New Zealand. Pompa et al. (2011) identiï¬ed nine âhotspotsâ based solely on species richness and 11 irreplaceable key conservation sites, based on the presence of endemic species, ï¬ve of these sites Hawaiian and Galapagos Islands, Mediterranean Sea, and the Yangtze river network were also identiï¬ed as CPAs. Finally, Kashner et al. (2011) using an environmental suitability model predicted highest marine mammal richness in New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, Galapagos, the Southeast Paciï¬c and Southern Ocean, all congruent with our study. Within the CPAs identiï¬ed here we highlight the presence of several top ranking conservation priority species among those are the extant monk seals (see Table 2). The UICN has estimated a 68 % reduction of Hawaiian monk seal abundance in the past 49 years, and projects an 86 % reduction in the next 15 years. The future for the Mediterranean monk seal seems bleak, current population estimates are about 350â 450 individuals (IUCN 2013). The Cap Blanc population in Nouadhibou is probably the most threatened, with less than 220 individuals. This is the last population with colonial structure, so its loss would also lead to the loss of a peculiar behavior amongst monk seals (e.g., Gonzalez 2006; Martinez-Jauregui et al. 2012; Gonzalez"
34,1023,0.986,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Much of the focus in this chapter and by state and federal agencies, scientists and others, deals with birds that concentrate along the coasts. It is far easier to census birds nesting there than it is to study pelagic seabirds. However, many seabirds mainly use the open, pelagic zones of the Gulf of Mexico. Seabirds do not simply migrate over or around the Gulf, but instead use the open waters of the Gulf for wintering and foraging. The Gulf waters also provide foraging habitat for more tropical-nesting species, some of which use the Campeche Banks for breeding (Tunnell and Chapman 2000), such as frigatebirds and boobies, and for North Atlantic-nesting species, such as Northern Gannet (see section below). Of all the birds considered, the distribution and behavior of pelagic species are the most affected by prey availability and oceanic features (Hunt 1990; Schneider 1991; Ribic et al. 1997; Schreiber and Burger 2001a, b; Zuria and Mellink 2005). In the Gulf of Mexico, the Loop Current and eddy systems greatly affect distribution of seabirds in the northern region (Ribic et al. 1997). Prey is not evenly distributed over the open ocean; individual prey patches are often small and interspersed (Hunt and Schneider 1987). Foraging seabirds can search for prey by (1) looking for the presence of feeding birds (plunge-diving) as a signal of prey availability (Simmons 1972; Gotmark et al. 1986; Gochfeld and Burger 1982), (2) looking for other seabirds flying in the same direction, presumably toward a prey patch, (3) watching birds that return to a colony with food (Gaston and Nettleship 1981), (4) searching for particular oceanographic conditions, and (5) returning to known foraging areas. Whether or not to associate with marine mammals is another decision foraging seabirds make (Burger 1988b, c). Foraging with mammals (whales, dolphins) can make prey fish more available and identify large expanses of zooplankton; it can also result in competition or interference foraging (Pierotti 1988a). Marine birds and mammals can interact in at least five ways: (1) birds can have passive associations; (2) birds can be attracted to the same resource; (3) birds can be actively drawn to marine mammals because they drive prey to the surface; (4) birds can be attracted to marine mammals to scavenge on by-products of mammal foraging; and (5) birds can actively avoid marine mammals that might prey on them; for example, Orcas eat diving birds (Pierotti 1988b). Seabirds often forage over schools of prey fish that have been forced to the surface by predatory fish, such as bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) or tuna (Safina and Burger 1985, 1988;"
34,999,0.986,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","et al. 1998). Most populations are resident, but the more northerly rails move south in the winter. Clapper Rails are strictly estuarineâthey very infrequently nest in freshwater marshes (Olson 1997), and are thus good indicators of marsh conditions, especially contaminants, oil, and habitat loss (Novak et al. 2011). They are a solitary species, and space out within marshes or mangroves. Clapper Rails mainly feed on crustaceans (Eddleman et al. 1998). They build nests in thick vegetation on the higher places, usually where vegetation is taller, providing some protection from aerial predators. They lay 7â9 eggs; most nest failures are due to predation on eggs, and flooding, which is likely to increase with sea level rise. Although young rails feed on their own, they remain with parents until they fledge. Future habitat changes that result from environmental stress, sea level rise, and subsidence will result in a landward increase in salinity (McKee et al. 2004), with changes in vegetation types and nesting bird populations (Greenberg et al. 2006). Since Clapper Rails nest and forage in habitats with higher salinity than some salt marsh birds, they may increase in Gulf Coast marshes with increased salt water intrusions (Rush et al. 2009a). While habitat loss is the most critical factor, tidal flooding and hunting pressures also decrease their populations (Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Because Clapper Rails breed and forage in coastal marshes and remain hidden most of the time, it is difficult to track their population numbers, although high tides (Rush et al. 2009b) and recent advances in acoustical monitoring make it easier to count them. There are no estimates for the number of Clapper Rails in Gulf Coast marshes, although they are counted on Breeding Bird Surveys and on Christmas Bird Counts. Breeding Bird Surveys indicate that they are declining in all states, except Louisiana, with lower declines in Florida than elsewhere (Figure 12.33). Using Christmas Bird Counts from 1965 to 2011 as a database, Niven and Butcher (2011) reported no significant trend in Clapper Rail wintering populations along the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, when these data are examined in detail, there appears to be a decline in the northern Gulf from the mid-1970s to the present (Figure 12.34). Resiliency may be intermediate to high, depending upon the availability of a source population. If a population is extirpated from a region because of habitat loss or degradation, excess available breeders from nearby areas would be necessary to reestablish the population. They likely breed at 1 year, have average clutch sizes of more than nine eggs in the Gulf Coast, and have variable hatching success, depending upon flood losses, that can average 85 % (Eddleman et al. 1998)."
34,826,0.986,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, beaches are cleaned by mechanical raking, scraping with large machinery, hand raking, and picking up debris by hand. These activities can directly and indirectly affect sea turtles (NMFS et al. 2011). Driving is permitted on many Gulf of Mexico beaches. Nesting sea turtles have been run over and killed by vehicles, and vehicles have crushed emerging hatchlings (NMFS et al. 2011). Because the Kempâs ridley has only one primary nesting beach in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and a secondary nesting colony at PAIS in Texas, it is particularly susceptible to beach disturbance, alteration, and destruction by natural and anthropogenic events. Beach cleaning has been documented to affect Kempâs ridleys. For example, 12 Kempâs ridley hatchlings became trapped by a sand ridge created by heavy equipment cleaning the beach on North Padre Island, Texas in 2002 and were later crushed and killed by passing vehicles (Shaver 2004). The presence of artificial lighting on or near the beach adversely affects both nesting and hatchling sea turtles (Witherington and Martin 1996). Mortality from misdirection by artificial lighting on both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of Florida kills thousands of loggerhead hatchlings each year (Witherington 1997). The proportion of all emerging loggerhead hatchlings that died because of beach lighting was estimated in the early 1990s to be as high as 5â10 % (Witherington et al. 1996). Loggerheads abort nesting attempts at a greater frequency in lighted areas. Artificial lighting also deters females from emerging from the ocean to nest (Witherington 1986, 1992). Hatchling orientation of nests located at 23 representative beaches in six Florida counties was surveyed in 1993 and 1994, and approximately 10â30 % of nests showed evidence of hatchling disorientation by lighting (Witherington et al. 1996). Similar to other nocturnal nesting sea turtles, nesting leatherbacks and hatchlings can be disoriented by artificial lighting on the beach (NMFS 2011b). A significant negative relationship was found between sea turtle nesting density and distance from the nearest of 17 ocean inlets (Witherington et al. 2005). Beach instability from both erosion and sand accretion may discourage sea turtle nesting, since the effect of inlets in lowering nesting density was found both updrift and downdrift of the inlets. When sea turtles emerged to nest in the presence of armoring structures, more returned to the water without nesting compared to turtles that emerged on nonarmored beaches (Mosier 1998; Mosier and Witherington 2002). Fewer sea turtles made nesting attempts on beaches fronted by seawalls than on adjacent beaches where armoring structures were absent (Mosier 1998). In addition, sea turtles on armored sections of beach had a tendency to wander great distances as compared to turtles that emerged to nest on adjacent natural beaches (Mosier 1998). Since oil exploration and production occurs south of Tamaulipas and Veracruz in Mexico and at PAIS in Texas, the Kempâs ridley nesting beaches, as well as the nesting turtles, eggs, and hatchlings, could be impacted by oil spills and related activities (NMFS et al. 2011). For example, in 1979, the Ixtoc I oil well blew out and caused a fire in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico. The nesting beach at Rancho Nuevo was affected by the Ixtoc I well blowout, and large amounts of oil were released daily into the Gulf of Mexico for several months. However, the oil reached the beach after the nesting season, and nesting females were not present. Also, a loaded supertanker, the Mega Borg, exploded near Galveston, Texas in 1990, causing more than 121,000 barrels of crude oil to be released into the Gulf of Mexico; sea turtles covered in oil were found after this spill (Yender and Mearns 2003). Oil spills have affected loggerhead nesting beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. In August 1993, approximately 350,000 gal of fuel oil spilled into Tampa Bay and washed onto nesting beaches in Pinellas County, Florida (Conant et al. 2009). Impacts to loggerheads resulting from the spill included 31 dead hatchlings, 176 oil-covered nests, and 2,177 eggs and hatchlings exposed to oil or disturbed by response activities (FDEP et al. 1997)."
36,134,0.986,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"In a multitaxon assessment in Brazil, Barlow et al. (2007) found similar numbers of bat species in Eucalyptus plantations and secondary forests recovering from burning, but both habitats supported much lower richness than did unlogged forests. Bat assemblages in plantations were nested subsets of those in forests; approximately 11 % of all species were shared between plantations and primary forest, 4 % were shared with secondary forest, and 39 % found in all habitats (Louzada et al. 2010). Nevertheless, three species (ca. 6 % of total) were captured exclusively in Eucalyptus plantations. A study in Brazilian Cerrado found lower species richness, diversity, and evenness of bat assemblages in Eucalyptus monocultures than in fragments of native Cerrado vegetation (Pina et al. 2013). Gleaning animalivorous phyllostomid bats were not captured in plantation forests. An earlier comparative study in Sumatra documented a distinct shift in bat assemblage structure in rubber and oil palm plantations, which supported only 13â25 % of the bat species richness found in forest (Danielsen and Heegaard 1995). However, more recent surveys have revealed additional species utilizing rubber plantations, especially those grown as agroforests or close to forest areas (Prasetyo et al. 2011). These studies point to an adverse response by bats to plantation development in both the New and Old World tropics. However, the extent to which these findings reflect true bat declines versus sampling bias (i.e., difficulties in capturing bats in open plantation habitats) is open to question. Tree plantations present a much more open habitat compared to forests, but can provide canopy structure similar to that in forest. This may present difficulties for capturing bats in these habitats, particularly in the Paleotropics, where much of the insectivorous bat fauna can only be captured in harp traps. Bat surveys in Sumatra and Borneo have resulted in extremely low capture rates for insectivorous species in oil palm plantations using mist nets and harp traps (Fukuda et al. 2009; Syamsi 2013), a finding that could reflect differential capture success in closed versus open habitats as well as true differences between habitats. Acoustic surveys could potentially contribute additional information concerning bat activity and the structure of bat assemblages in these habitats. The first insights from the Old World come from southern Thailand, where Phommexay et al. (2011) sampled bats in forest and neighboring rubber plantations using bat detectors, mist nets, and harp traps. Although diversity and overall bat activity were much lower in plantations than in forests, differences between the two habitat types were not as severe as indicated by capture-based surveys. Acoustic sampling in plantations detected less than half the number of bat species found in forest and fewer bat passes. Although bat activity was clearly reduced in plantations, a substantial number of feeding buzzes were detected, suggesting that bats were still foraging in this modified habitat. Key research needs: â¢ Further studies, particularly those using acoustic methods, to accurately assess the conservation value of tree plantations for tropical bats."
36,718,0.986,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Cave-dwelling bats are especially vulnerable to harvesting for consumption and trade due to their aggregation into these confined spaces. Reviews of global patterns in bat hunting for bushmeat indicate that this is common in the Old World tropics, but with possible exceptions, does not appear to be widespread or having a significant effect in other regions (Mickleburgh et al. 2009; Mildenstein et al. 2016). Though a problem in Madagascar and in many African countries, the threat to cavedwelling bats appears to be most widespread and acute in the Asian tropics, where bat harvesters target many species. For instance, Hall et al. (2002) reported dramatic declines in E. spelaea and the greater naked bat (Cheiromeles torquatus) during their successive surveys of Niah caves, Sarawak compared with numbers recorded in earlier surveys by Medway (1958) and attribute this to hunting for human consumption. While Asian hunters often target species that are large, colonial and/or abundant (e.g. E. spelaea, Rousettus spp., C. torquatus, C. plicatus and bent-winged bats Miniopterus spp.), smaller bats are also taken and harvesting activities are highly likely to negatively affect other species sharing the same caves (Hutson et al. 2001; Mickleburgh et al. 2009). Given the scale and severity of bushmeat hunting on bats, there is a pressing need for research on sustainable harvesting. Despite its widespread occurrence, accounts of the impact of guano harvesting upon cave-dwelling bats appear to remain largely anecdotal. This may stem in part from the difficulty of accurately monitoring large bat colonies, although rates of guano accumulation and harvesting records reflect their size (Fig. 15.9)."

That worm is typically found in the mullet during winter months and absent by May or June. We do not know the snail intermediate host, but it is probably a hydrobiid that was rare in our Mississippi estuaries pre-Katrina. Parasites in migratory fish are another matter. Adults of the bucephalid Prosorhynchoides ovatus in the Atlantic tripletail (Lobotes surinamensis) occurred abundantly inshore and offshore both before and after the storm as did other bucephalids from other offshore migratory fishes such as scombrids. The bucephalid lifecycle involves a bivalve to a fish to the final fish host. Fauna of the sandy barrier islands off Mississippi include a variety of crustaceans, clams, snails, polychaetes, acorn worms, brittle stars, and other invertebrates. Even though those beaches were lost or reshaped, most of the nearshore beach fauna was reestablished, according to Richard Heard of USM, within 6â12 months. Some of the species on the Gulf side took longer, up to 2 years, especially those species without planktonic larvae such as pericaridean crustaceans (like amphipods and isopods). Reestablishment of these animals was easier to determine than that of those from the muddy benthos, but what is important to remember in regard to parasites is that once the invertebrate has reestablished, worms from an infected final host have to deposit eggs and the resulting larvae have to infect those invertebrate hosts. As indicated above, this infection of a parasite may take several years, and the final monitoring results provide information on the presence of all the hosts for a particular parasite in the ecosystem and the overall environmental health of that ecosystem. Parasites are also good indicators of toxicants in the ecosystem. The myxosporidian Henneguya gambusi probably infects Gambusia affinis, the western mosquitofish, in extremely low intensity and is difficult to detect. However, when in a stream along coastal Mississippi that was contaminated with the heavy metals chromium, copper, and arsenate, the mosquitofish exhibited heavy infections that involved the intestine, gonads, kidney, and even brain tissue (Overstreet and Monson 2002). Infections presumably kill the mosquitofish in nature since when we transferred samples of fish from this location into the laboratory and maintained them in aquaria, a little more than half the fish died within 6 months when compared with none dying nor expressing an infection in samples collected from non-contaminated locations. No infected fish survived 12 months, but non-infected ones had a high survival. After the hurricane, infections were absent; however, they occurred again in August 2007. The surge apparently flushed out the contaminated water and the infected oligochaete intermediate hosts. The mosquitofish from this location before the hurricane contained no adult tapeworm infection. After the storm, the invasive Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi) showed up in the mosquitofish (Figure 14.44); this adult cestode had previously been collected from mosquitofish in locations numerous kilometers from that contaminated location. Parasites have been shown to be good indicators of pollution, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PCBs, but usually as non-point sources. Some studies treat the Gulf (e.g., Overstreet and Howse 1977; Skinner 1982; Overstreet 1988; Landsberg et al. 1998; VidalMartÄ±Ìnez et al. 2014), but most studies treat other areas (e.g., Khan and Thulin 1991; MacKenzie et al. 1995; Austin 1999; Broeg et al. 1999; Dzikowski et al. 2003). Most of the studies have shown that the parasites of fish are more sensitive biomarkers to environmental stressors than the fish by themselves. Landsberg et al. (1998) related specific natural and chemical stressors to specific parasites in the silver perch in Florida. Skinner (1982) showed that the gills of the yellow fin mojarra (Gerres cinereus), grey snapper, and timucu (Strongylura timucu) from a polluted but not a non-polluted area in Biscayne Bay, Florida, expressed excessive mucus production, epithelial hyperplasia, fused lamellae, and telangiectasia. Three species of monogenoids on the gills of fish from the polluted area occurred in significantly greater mean intensity, presumably because of gill pathology and altered host resistance to the parasites.

Interestingly, their cross-correlation analyses suggest the propagation of a climate signal from SST through decapod larvae, adult crabs and lesser black-backed gulls with lags that match the biology of each trophic group.

Case Study 5: Vulnerability of the seabird community in the western North Sea to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Most seabird studies have tended to consider the impacts of single stressors on single species at speciï¬c times of the year, and so may be unrepresentative of the combined effects of pressures experienced by top predator communities over an annual cycle (Burthe et al. 2014). For marine top predators, there is evidence to suggest that interactions between climate and other threats may be additive (Frederiksen et al. 2004b; Burthe et al. 2014). Burthe et al. (2014) studied the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a community of seabirds in the North Sea. More precisely, they examined vulnerability to climate change and other anthropogenic threats in a seabird community (45 species; 11 families) that used the Forth and Tay region (eastern Scotland) of the North Sea for breeding, overwintering or migration between 1980 and 2011. They found only 13 % of the seabird community in the Forth and Tay region to fall within the categories of low or very low population concern to future warming, whereas in considering multiple anthropogenic threats 73 % of the species in this bird community were considered to be of high or very high population concern for the future (Burthe et al. 2014). Case Study 6: Effects of extreme climatic events on coastal birds breeding in low-lying saltmarshes (for a more extensive review see Chap. 9). Van de Pol et al. (2010) investigated whether the frequency, magnitude and timing of rare but catastrophic flooding events have changed over time in Europeâs largest estuary, the Wadden Sea. They subsequently quantiï¬ed how this had affected the flooding risk of six saltmarsh nesting bird species (both seabird species and coastal species). Maximum high tide has increased twice as fast as mean high tide over the past four decades, resulting in more frequent and more catastrophic flooding of nests, especially around the time when most eggs have just hatched. By using data on speciesâ nest elevations, on the timing of egg-laying and on the length of time that the eggs and chicks are at risk from flooding, van de Pol et al. (2010) showed that flood risk increased for all six species (even after accounting for compensatory land accretion) and that this could worsen in the near future if the species do not adapt. This study provides the ï¬rst evidence that increasing flooding risks have reduced the reproductive output below stable population levels in at least one species, the Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus.

At the northern and southern extremes of their distribution, Atlantic sailfish occur only in the warmer months. The seasonal changes in distribution may be linked to prey migrations. The rates of Atlantic sailfish bycatch in the pelagic longline fisheries are two times higher in the Gulf of Mexico than in other areas of the North Atlantic during the spawning season, from May through September (De Sylva and Breder 1997), suggesting that spawning biomass in the Gulf of Mexico tends to be higher than spawning biomass in other areas of the Atlantic. This suggests that the Gulf of Mexico provides an important spawning and larval habitat for Atlantic sailfish. Essential fish habitat has been designated for juvenile, adult, and spawning Atlantic sailfish. These habitats are described in Table 9.26 and shown in Figures 9.42, 9.43, 9.44, and 9.45."
