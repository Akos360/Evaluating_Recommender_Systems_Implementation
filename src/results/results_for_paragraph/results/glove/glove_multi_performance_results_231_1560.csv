391,228,0.978,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"1996; Stubbins et al. 2006a, 2008; Valentine and Zepp 1993; Xie et al. 2005; Zafiriou et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2006; Ziolkowski and Miller 2007; Zuo and Jones 1995). A biotic source of CO originating from macro-algae was also investigated by different groups (Loewus and Delwiche 1963; Troxler and Dokos 1973), but King (2001) concluded that this source is not a significant fraction of the global oceanic source. Recently, laboratory studies of trace gas emissions by various phytoplankton species have shown that CO is also emitted directly by phytoplankton under photosynthetically available radiation (Gros et al. 2009). Cyanobacteria and diatoms were the largest CO emitters and this source could account for up to 20 % of the CO production in seawater. Finally, another source of oceanic CO is the so-called âdark productionâ which has been reported by several groups (Day and Faloona 2009 and references therein) and which is needed to explain non-zero CO values below the euphotic zone (Kettle 2005). The first detailed measurements of CO in the mixed layer of the oceanic water column in the Pacific Ocean showed that it varies seasonally and regionally with daily means between 0.1 and 4.7 nmol L 1 (Bates et al. 1995). CO showed pronounced diurnal cycles with maxima in the afternoon, in agreement with the photochemical nature of the main source in water. Since then, measurements of CO have been performed only over a few additional areas in the open ocean. Stubbins et al. (2006b) determined values between 0.2 and 2.6 nmol L 1 during an Atlantic Meridional cruise (from 35  S to 54  N). Gros et al. (unpublished data) measured values around 1 nmol L 1 in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, with levels rising to 20 nmol L 1 in a phytoplankton bloom near the Argentinian coast. Xie et al. (2009) conducted measurements in the open waters of the South Eastern Beaufort Sea at two different seasons with mean concentrations of 0.45 and 4.7 nmol L 1 in spring and autumn, respectively. In shelf waters, CO concentrations were also found to be variable but with values in the upper range of those measured in the open ocean. Day and Faloona (2009) found values between 2.7 and 17 nmol L 1 for a Californian upwelling system; Xie et al. (2005) measured values around 1 nmol L 1 in the Beaufort Sea and Gulf Stream and 2â18 nmol L 1 in the coastal NW Atlantic. Yang et al. (2010, 2011) have recently"
391,884,0.978,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"(Gordon et al. 2001; Balch et al. 2005) and the most recent have been used to process the whole SeaWiFS and MODIS data set. An important constraint of these algorithms is that, at typical non-bloom concentrations, the PIC scattering represents only a few percent of the total scattering. Thus, to maximise the signal to noise ratio, satellite pixels must be aggregated in space and time, in order to define accurate mean concentrations. Currently, more verification with PIC field measurements is underway to optimise the use of PIC ocean-colour data in models (Balch et al. 2011). PIC is also produced by certain zooplanktonic organisms but these particles are too large to be detected by ocean colour (Balch et al. 1996). Different bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use ocean colour data to identify and differentiate between PFTs or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) in the surface ocean. These can be summarised into four main types: spectral-response methods which are based on differences in the shape of the light reflectance/absorption spectrum for different PFTs/PSCs (Sathyendranath et al. 2004; Alvain et al. 2005, 2008; Ciotti and Bricaud 2006; Bracher et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2011; Brewin et al. 2010a; Devred et al. 2011), methods which use information on the magnitude of chlorophyll a biomass or light absorption to distinguish between PFTs or PSCs (Devred et al. 2006; Uitz et al. 2006; Hirata et al. 2008; Brewin et al. 2010b; Hirata et al. 2011; Mouw and Yoder 2010), methods that retrieve the particle size distribution from satellite-derived backscattering signal and derive PSCs (Kostadinov et al. 2010), and ecological-based approaches which use information on environmental factors, such as temperature and wind stress, to supplement the bio-optical data for investigating PFTs (Raitsos et al. 2008). All methods derive dominant phytoplankton groups, while Uitz et al. (2006), Bracher et al. (2009, improved by Sadeghi et al. 2011) and Hirata et al. (2011) also give chl a for the different PFTs. Nearly all the PFT methods mentioned use information from the multispectral ocean colour sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS or MODIS and are based on the parameterisation of a large global or regional in situ data set in order to yield PFTs from satellite chl a or normalised water leaving radiances. Unexpected changes in the relationships between these parameters resulting from a regional or temporal sampling bias leads to a bias in the"

222,251,0.977,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"A coupled global (HadCM3) (Gordon et al. 2000; Pope et al. 2000; Collins et al. 2001) and regional (HadRM3P) (Massey et al. 2015) climate model developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre was used to project temperature and precipitation across the GBM region up to 2099 (Collins et al. 2011; Caesar et al. 2015). Given uncertainty in climate model parameter values, 17 different combinations of parameter values were used to identify ranges in possible temperature and precipitation changes (see Chap. 11, Fig. 11.3). Despite substantial variability between the 17 iterations, all projections indicate a warmer and wetter climate by 2099. From these 17 scenarios, three were selected for application in the models to cover a range of possible change (Q0, Q8 and Q16). Ensemble members were selected to provide a central baseline (Q0), a warmer and drier scenario during the mid-century (Q8), and a much warmer and wetter scenario for both 2050 and 2099 (Q16). Sea-level rise is also a critical issue for Bangladesh. Global sea-level rise scenarios are based directly on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Church et al. 2013). These are not explicitly coupled to the Q0, Q8 and Q16 scenarios, and their application is explained in the relevant chapter (see Chaps. 14 and 16). Land subsidence is taken from observations (Chap. 15), while example cyclones are used to illustrate their possible effects (Chap. 16)."

Belle results for B Â± â DK âÂ± are reported in Poluektov (2006). The model uncertainties in the case of the Belle analysis are reported for the physics parameters Ï3 , rB , and Î´B ; the uncertainties on zÂ± , zÂ± , and zÂ± quoted in Table 17.8.8 are based on information provided by Belle and published in Asner et al.

BABAR further combined these results with their measurements of the product B of the B â D(â) Ds1 (2460)+ decays (Aubert, 2004ad), measured similarly to the described Belle analysis. This allowed a first measurement of the Ds1 (2460)+ decay rates: B(Ds1 (2460)+ â Dsâ+ Ï 0 ) = (56 Â± 13 Â± 9)%, B(Ds1 (2460)+ â Ds+ Î³) = (16 Â± 4 Â± 3)%. (19.3.19) Belle studied the production of the Ds1 (2536)+ meson in B â D(â) Ds1 (2536)+ decays, with D(â) being either D0 or D(â)â , using a data sample of 657 Ã 106 BB pairs (Aushev, 2011). The Ds1 (2536)+ is reconstructed in its dominant decay modes, Dâ+ KS0 and Dâ0 K + . Figure 19.3.23 shows the M (Ds1 (2536)) spectra for the B candidates satisfying the ÎE-mES selection, for each D(â) flavor and the Ds1 (2536)+ decay mode separately. All these distributions are fitted simultaneously, with the signal Ds1 (2536)+ described as a BW function convolved with a double Gaussian function describing the mass resolution. The measured Ds1 (2536)+ mass and width were respectively 2534.1 Â± 0.6 MeV/c2 and 0.75 Â± 0.23 MeV/c2 , consistent with their PDG values (Beringer et al., 2012). A fit with the Ds1 (2536)+ partial width ratio kept as a free parameter, yields: B(Ds1 (2536)+ â Dâ0 K + ) = 0.88 Â± 0.24 Â± 0.08, B(Ds1 (2536)+ â Dâ+ K 0 ) (19.3.20) in agreement with the BABAR study (Aubert, 2008bd). Table 19.3.11 summarizes ratios of branching fractions, calculated using the latest measurements of the B â D(â) Ds(J) branching fractions, as well as the Ds1 (2536)+ measurements by Belle (Aushev, 2011) and BABAR (Aubert, 2008bd). In these calculations, 100% branching fracâ tions are assumed for the Ds0 (2317)+ â Ds+ Ï 0 and Ds1 (2536)+ â Dâ K decay modes. Within the factorization model and in the heavy quark limit, these raâ tios should be of order unity for the Ds0 (2317)+ and Ds1 (2460)+ , whereas for the Ds1 (2536)+ they are predicted to be very small (Datta and OâDonnell, 2003b; Le Yaouanc, Oliver, PeÌne, and Raynal, 1996). The decay pattern for the Ds1 (2536)+ follows these expectations, whereas for the Ds0 (2317)+ and Ds1 (2460)+ the ratios are rather diï¬erent from unity and therefore such an approach"

241,676,0.974,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The GCMs were not designed for direct application in impact models. Prudhomme et al. (2002) stated that the quality of their output did not allow for direct use in hydrological impact studies, because the spatial and temporal scales were too coarse. Wilby et al. (1999) recommended the use of downscaling techniques before the GCM output data could be used in impact studies. There are many possibilities for downscaling GCM output: direct use of RCM output (Wood et al. 2004), use of bias-corrected RCM output (Wood et al. 2004; Fowler et al. 2007a), statistical downscaling (Wilby et al. 2000; MÃ¼ller-Wohlfeil et al. 2000), stochastic weather generators (Evans and Schreider 2002) or weather typologies, and/or indices (Pilling and Jones 2002). The skills of different downscaling methods differ considerably between variables and regions. Hydrologic simulation was found to be sensitive to biases in the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation at the monthly level, especially where the seasonal snow pack transfers run-off from one season to the next (Fowler et al. 2007c). Using the example of the Lule River in northern Sweden and two GCMs used to force the same RCM, Graham et al. (2007a) have shown that the choice of driving GCM has a greater impact on results than the choice of GHG emission scenario. The strong impact of the choice of GCM was also emphasised by Widmann et al. (2003), Jasper et al. (2004), SalathÃ© (2005), and Wilby et al. (2006). Fowler et al. (2007a) stated that at least two variablesâ temperature and precipitationâhad to be downscaled for impact studies in hydrology. In impact models, the physical consistency between variables is very important. To obey this requirement for physical consistency, multi-variate methods should be applied which yield simultaneous correction of relevant variables. This is possible when RCMs are used (Fowler and Kilsby 2007; Fowler et al. 2007a; Graham et al. 2007a, b), but is generally not in statistical downscaling. A multi-site approach should be used when spatial consistency is needed."

241,772,0.974,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(GCMs) used as surface boundary conditions in RCMs might be biased due to the coarse resolution of GCMs. Such biases would affect model sensitivity and hence the results in climate projections (Meier et al. 2011d). To reduce computational demands, scenario simulations were performed for selected time slices only (e.g. Madsen 2009) which requires the application of the âdeltaâ or âdelta changeâ approach (e.g. Meier 2002). Since the ï¬rst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea basin (BACC Author Team 2008), the number of relevant scenario simulations has increased considerably. In particular, a large number of scenario simulations were carried out during 2009â2011 within the ECOSUPPORT project (advanced modelling tool for scenarios of the Baltic Sea ECOsystem to SUPPORT decision making, www. baltex-research.eu/ecosupport). The following items characterise the new simulations compared to the ï¬rst BACC assessment: â¢ The horizontal resolution of atmosphere and ocean model components increased to typically less than 25 and 3.6 km, respectively (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). â¢ New model versions of GCMs and RCMs were used. â¢ The results and assumptions of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) were used instead of those from the IPCCâs Third Assessment Report (IPCC 2001). â¢ Multi-model ensemble modelling was introduced to estimate uncertainties due to biases in the Baltic Sea models (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). â¢ Instead of time slices often combined with the delta approach (e.g. Meier 2006), transient simulations (1960â 2100) were performed (e.g. Neumann 2010). â¢ Coupled physicalâbiogeochemical models were used (Neumann 2010; Meier et al. 2011a, b, c, 2012a, b, c; Eilola et al. 2012; Neumann et al. 2012). This chapter relies on literature concerning climate change scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea between 2007 and (March) 2012. The focus is on projected changes in water temperature, salinity, sea ice, storm surges, and wind waves. Changes in marine biogeochemical variables such as oxygen, nutrients, and phytoplankton (chlorophyll) concentrations are addressed in Chaps. 18 and 19. The graphics included in this chapter (with the exception of Fig. 13.6) show ensemble mean changes projected for 2069â2098 relative to a baseline/reference of 1978â2007 in transient scenario simulations calculated with three coupled physicalâ biogeochemical models for the Baltic Sea following Meier et al. (2011b, 2012c). The Baltic Sea models are forced with RCM data driven by two GCMs at the lateral boundaries and two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (SRES A1B and A2, see NakiÄenoviÄ et al. 2000).

(1998) showed that sea ice is permeable to brine transport when brine volume fraction is above 5 %, corresponding to a temperature of 5  C and sea ice salinity of 5 â the so-called âlaw of fivesâ-. Gas transport within sea ice is therefore possible as observed by (Gosink et al. 1976) who reported CO2 and SF6 diffusion in sea ice at 7  C. More recently, Loose et al. (2011b) measured accurately diffusion of SF6 and O2 through columnar sea-ice and reported diffusion coefficient values within permeable artificial columnar ice of 1.3  10 4 cm2 s 1 and 3.9  10 5 cm2 s 1 for SF6 and O2, respectively. These values are rather low compared to air-sea transfers in open water. However, it must be borne in mind that sea ice covers about 7 % of the Earth surface at its maximal seasonal extent and represents one of the largest biomes on Earth. Even though fluxes through sea ice are modest, integrated over the global sea ice cover can potentially be significant (Delille et al. 2006). Several studies reported measurements of direct air-ice CO2 exchanges. Most studies reported air-ice CO2 fluxes in spring and summer (Delille et al. 2006; Semiletov et al. 2004; Zemmelink et al. 2006; Nomura et al. 2010a, b; Papakyriakou and Miller 2011). Strikingly, some studies reported air-ice CO2 exchange during the winter season when the air-ice interface is supposed to be impermeable to gas exchanges (Heinesch et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2011). Indeed, despite the fact that sea ice can be seen as an ideal environment for micro-meteorological measurement of CO2 fluxes (Loose et al. 2011a) since the surface is relatively smooth and levelled, air-ice CO2 fluxes measurements are still in their infancy. Different methods are used, without inter-comparison, and temporal and spatial coverage is scarce. In addition, the early studies of Semiletov et al. (2004) and Zemmelink et al. (2006) should be considered cautiously as they do not take into account bias of open path sensor CO2 analysers in cold environments, as pointed out by Burba et al. (2008). For the time being, sea ice heterogeneity, gaps in understanding of sea ice biogeochemistry, poor understanding of the role of snow in controlling air-ice gas fluxes and poor temporal and spatial coverage prevent robust integration of air-ice gas fluxes at large scale. Further studies are required to provide such assessments."

Peaking background is dominated by the following sources: B 0 â Dâ+ Ï â and B 0 â Dâ+ Ïâ with secondary-lepton or fake lepton tags; B 0 â Dâââ Ï + , B + â Dââ0 Ï + , and B 0 â Dââ Ï + Ï 0 decays with primary-lepton, secondary-lepton, or fake lepton tags. Peaking and non-peaking background p.d.f.s are convolved with their own resolution functions. From the fit Belle obtains Îmd = (0.509 Â± 0.017 Â± 0.020) psâ1 , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The systematic error in Îmd is dominated by uncertainties in the background fractions (0.014 psâ1 ) and the signal Ît resolution function (0.012 psâ1 ). 17.5.2.4 Fully-reconstructed ï¬nal states Hadronic decay modes BABAR reconstructs neutral B mesons in the decay modes B 0 â D(â)â Ï + , D(â)â Ï+ , D(â)â a+ using a data 1 , J/ÏK sample of 29.7 fb (Aubert, 2002a,b). Belle uses the B decays to the hadronic final states Dâ Ï + , Dââ Ï + , and Dââ Ï+ in a data sample of 29.1 fbâ1 (Tomura, 2002b). The B 0B 0 mixing analyses with fully-reconstructed final states reconstruct the same decay modes of the B 0 daughters as in the B 0 lifetime measurements described in Section 17.5.1.3 (Aubert, 2001c; Abe, 2002m). Both experiments reduce background from continuum events by applying requirements on the normalized second FoxWolfram moment R2 and the angle between the thrust axis of the particles that form the reconstructed B candidate and the thrust axis of the remaining tracks and unmatched calorimeter clusters in the event, computed in the Î¥ (4S) frame. Neutral B candidates are identified by their ÎE and mES values. BABAR selects events with mES > 5.2 GeV/c2 and |ÎE| within Â±2.5Ï of zero. They use the events in the background-dominated region mES < 5.27 GeV/c2 to determine the parameters of the background Ît distributions. Belle requires mES and ÎE to be within Â±3Ï around their expected means. They use candidates from a sideband region in the mES â ÎE plane to determine the background parameters. Events with a reconstructed B 0 are then analyzed to determine the flavor of the other B using the B flavor tagging algorithms described in detail in Chapter 8. Belle assigns 99.5% of the events to a flavor tag category, while BABAR rejects the 30% of events with marginal flavor discrimination. The decay time diï¬erence Ît between B decays is determined from the measured separation Îz = zrec â ztag along the z axis between the vertices of the reconstructed Brec and the flavor-tagging Btag according to Eq. (17.5.13). BABAR applies an event-by-event correction for the directions of the B meson momenta with respect to the z direction in the Î¥ (4S) frame. A description of this correction and details of the calculation of zrec and ztag and their respective resolutions for fully-reconstructed B decays are given in Chapter 6. In its paper, BABAR notes"

Until now, only a limited number of global surveys have been conducted on the quantity and distribution of microplastics in the oceans (Lusher 2015). Most surveys focused on specific oceanic regions and habitats, such as coastal areas, regional seas, gyres or the poles (Thompson et al. 2004, Collignon et al. 2012; Rios and Moore 2007). Concentrations of microplastics at sea vary from thousands to hundreds of thousands of particles kmâ2 and latest reports suggest that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the worldâs oceans from the water column (Lattin et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2011) to sediments even of the deep sea (Moore et al. 2001b; Law et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 2011; Cole et al. 2011; Collignon et al. 2012; Erikssen et al. 2014; Reisser et al. 2013; van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2015). Recently, microplastics were also recorded from Arctic sea ice in densities two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported from highly contaminated surface waters, such as those of the Pacific gyre (Obbard et al. 2014). This has important implications considering the projected acceleration in sea ice melting due to global climate change and concomitant release of microplastics to the Arctic marine ecosystem. Time-series data on the composition and abundance of microplastics are sparse. However, available evidence on long-term trends suggests various patterns in microplastic concentrations. A decade ago, Thompson et al. (2004) demonstrated the broad spatial extent and accumulation of this type of contamination. They found plastic particles in sediments from U.K. beaches and archived among the plankton in samples dating back to the 1960s with a significant increase in abundance over time. More recent evidence indicated that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific subtropical gyre have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades (Goldstein et al. 2013). However, no change in microplastic concentration was observed at the surface of the North Atlantic gyre for a period of 30 years (Law et al. 2010). Less is known about the composition of microplastics in the oceans. Evidence suggests a temporal decrease in the average size of plastic litter (Barnes et al. 2009; Erikssen et al. 2014). Studies based on the stomach contents of shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) in the Bering Sea also indicated a decrease in âindustrialâ primary pellets and an increase in âuserâ plastic between the 1970s and the late 1990s (Vlietstra and Parga 2002) but constant levels over the last decade (Van Franeker et al. 2011). Similarly, long-term data from The Netherlands since the 1980s show a decrease of industrial plastics and an increase in user plastics, with shipping and fisheries being the main sources (van Franeker 2012)."
238,173,0.973,Nanoinformatics,"In this study, three-dimensional images of granular packings with several packing ratio ð are obtained by using XCT, and these images provide precise positional coordinates of grains. Our interest is to characterize the skeleton deformation structures of grain conï¬gurations during the crystallization process. For experimental details, please see the original paper. Figure 5.14 shows the two-dimensional persistence diagrams computed on the grain conï¬gurations for four packing ratios ð = 0.6, 0.63, 0.69, and 0.73. Here, we note that the packing ratio ð = 0.64 is known as the Bernalâs density at which sharp structural transition to jamming is observed. As we observe from the ï¬gure, the persistence diagram (d) at the crystallized state consists of two strong peaks at (0.288, 0.353) and (0.288, 0.5), and they correspond to the regular tetrahedral and the regular octahedral conï¬gurations, respectively. We note that the persistence diagram (c) is similar to D2 (î­LJ amo ) in Fig. 5.13 (the Lennard-Jones system), since both are classiï¬ed as random packing systems. The tetrahedral peaks are well preserved for all packing ratios, while the octahedral peaks only exist at (c) and (d). Actually, further studies show that the octahedral peaks are only observable for packing ratios ð > 0.64. Next, let us study the persistence diagram (c) at ð = 0.69 in detail. Figure 5.15a is the same persistence diagram at ð = 0.69, in which four curves (D1, D2, D3, and D4) corresponding to the boundaries are drawn. In the paper, we found the analytical expressions of the actual deformations of grain conï¬gurations corresponding to these curves. Figure 5.15b and c show those deformations.

In this Figure we plotted the bifurcation curves L = BTBS , L = BTCP , L = TIS , L = FIA and L = P FBS in the (E, L)-parameter plane for the values of the other parameters as in (24) and (25). Crossing these curves the properties of the equilibria change. In Fig. 1, the blue region is related to the coexisting attracting equilibria IS and IAi , i = 1, 2, 3, while for the parameter values belonging to the yellow region the attracting equilibrium IS coexists with the attracting equilibria CPi . Note that the curve FIA is meaningful for E > E1 and that the curve BTCP intersects the curve TIS at E = 2b c =: E2 . We now study how the properties of the equilibria of the dynamic system Z changes for a fixed E < E2 , for example, for E = 1.5, by increasing L:10 â¢ For 1 < L < BTBS there are three coexisting attracting CP equilibria, and crossing L = BTBS (when a transverse âborder transcritical bifurcationâ of BSi , i = 1, 2, 3, occurs), the fixed points BSi become repelling and the saddle fixed points IAâ²i are born.

According to the validation with observed climate along the historical period, the RCM was bias-corrected for the whole simulated period (Cervigni et al. 2013 â Chap. 4 and Appendix B). To take into account the uncertainty on future climate outcomes nine GCMs simulations taking part of the CMIP3 experiment plus those from the CMCC-MED GCM, were used to âperturbâ the RCM results along the period 2006â2065 and maintain high resolution. The GCMs chosen for the simulations were thus: HadCM3, CGCM_2.3.2, CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, CCSM3, MIROC3.2, GFDL_cm2.1, ECHAM5, FGOALS, and CMCC-MED.

Among them are the multiple regression (Murphy 1999), the CCA method (Busuioc et al. 1999), and the SVD method (Bretherton et al. 1992). The difference between these approaches is that the multiple regression minimises the root-mean-square errors (distance between predictions and observations), the CCA maximises the correlation, and the SVD maximises the covariance between two ï¬elds. Artiï¬cial neural networks also represent nonlinear regression models (Crane and Hewitson 1998). 10.3.2.3 Weather Classification Methods The weather classiï¬cation methods involve various strategies, such as analogues (Zorita and von Storch 1999; Timbal et al. 2008), circulation classiï¬cation schemes (BÃ¡rdossy and Caspary 1990; Jones et al. 1993), cluster analysis (CorteReal et al. 1999; Huth 2000), and neural nets. The analogue model involves searching the record of past events and taking the day that most closely matches the situation wanted to predict. Cluster analysis bases the predictions on a number of closest states (Wilks 1995), either by taking the mean of the days with close matches or by using the observed values for all days that match the predicted state, and constructing a statistical distribution (histogram). From this sample, or a ï¬tted probability density distribution, a random value may be drawn. Neural nets involve various adaptive learning algorithms, such as âartiï¬cial intelligenceâ (Wilby et al. 1998; Hewitson and Crane 2002). The analogue model, circulation classiï¬cation schemes, and cluster analysis all involve a re-sampling of past measurements. These re-sampling techniques suffer from one caveat that the tails of the distributions will be distorted because the sampling cannot produce new record-breaking values (Benestad 2008). Even stationary series are expected to produce new record-breaking events, given sufï¬ciently long intervals for observations. Theory of independent and identically distributed (iid) series shows that the expected occurrence of new record-breaking events will converge towards zero, but never actually become zero. Nevertheless, this implies that the upper and lower tails of the distribution of the results from the re-sampling methods may be distorted and that the"

However, most of the map cells would contain no emission. Thus, the usual procedure is to measure the positions of the features crudely by fringe-frequency analysis and then to map small fields around these locations by Fourier synthesis techniques. Examples of maps made by fringe-frequency analysis can be found in Walker et al. (1982); by phase analysis in Genzel et al. (1981) and Norris and Booth (1981); and by Fourier synthesis in Reid et al. (1980), Norris et al. (1982), and Boboltz et al. (1997). We shall briefly discuss some of the techniques used in mapping masers and their accuracies. Note that geometric (group) delays cannot be measured accurately because of the narrow bandwidths of the maser lines. In mapping masers, we must explicitly consider the frequency dependence of the fringe visibility. We assume that a maser source consists of a number of point sources.

241,1042,0.972,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Compilations of data concerning the waterborne input (riverine input and point sources) and the atmospheric input of N and P into the entire Baltic Sea including the Kattegat are available through various HELCOM publications. The input data refer to both the inorganic and organic forms of N and P. Whereas the inorganic species are readily available for biological production, it is still an open question how much of the organic fraction is bioavailable and thus contributes to eutrophication. A summary of an input estimate (HELCOM 2005) based on 2000 data was given in the ï¬rst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea (BACC Author Team 2008). An updated estimate based on data for 2001â2006 was recently published (HELCOM 2011). According to this later report, the annual waterborne inputs are 641,000 t N yearâ1 and 28,700 t P yearâ1. Adding an atmospheric deposition of 198,000 t N yearâ1 (Bartnicki et al. 2011) yields a total N input to the Baltic Sea of 840,000 t N yearâ1 (Table 18.1). According to HELCOM (2011), the atmospheric P deposition contributes 5 % to the total P input (1500 t P yearâ1) resulting in a total input of 30,200 t P yearâ1 (Table 18.1). These estimates differ only slightly from the values given in the previous HELCOM (2005) report and presented in the ï¬rst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea (BACC Author Team 2008). Attempts have been made to estimate nutrient inputs at the beginning of the last century when the influence of human activities was low (Larsson et al. 1985; Savchuk et al. 2008). Gustafsson et al. (2012) used data from different sources to reconstruct the N and P inputs to the various basins of the Baltic Sea including the Kattegat since 1850 (Fig. 18.2). For the period 1970â2006, annual land-borne loads for total N and total P, which include the input from rivers and point sources, are based on data compiled in the BED (Savchuk et al. 2012).

241,879,0.972,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"strongly limited by the quality of the numerical weather prediction models providing meteorological data. For example, models generally have problems with sub-grid precipitation, simulating precipitation more often, but in lower amounts, than reality. As precipitation scavenging is a complex and nonlinear process (e.g. Barrie 1992) such issues will cause errors in modelled wet deposition that are difï¬cult to evaluate. There are also many uncertainties inherent in the deposition monitoring methods themselves (Draaijers and Erisman 1993; Erisman et al. 2005). Large differences between models were found in the global models participating in the COSAM study, in which the wet deposition efï¬ciency varied by a factor of four (Roelofs et al. 2001). A similar spread was also found for global models by Dentener et al. (2006) and Textor et al. (2006). At the European scale, the EMEP MSC-W model (Simpson et al. 2012) has been subject to extensive evaluation against observed wet deposition estimates. Standard scatter plots showing model performance against observed concentrations of NO3â and NH4+ are available in the annual EMEP status reports (e.g. Fagerli and Hjellbrekke 2008; Berge and Hjellbrekke 2010).

In this analysis the J/Ï is reconstructed in the dimuon channel only, because the e+ eâ final state has much larger backgrounds from radiative Bhabha events.

Then using the known leptonic branching fractions it is possible to derive both the electronic width Îee = (5.61 Â± 0.20) keV, and the total width Îtot = Îee /B(J/Ï â e+ eâ ) = (94.7 Â± 4.4) keV. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are combined in quadrature. The BABAR Îee Ã B(J/Ï â Î¼+ Î¼â ) result is one of three measurements contributing to the current world average, which is (0.334Â±0.005) keV (Beringer et al., 2012)."

(23.2.6), the ratio fs = (18.1 Â± 3.6 Â± (â)0 (â)0 events to all bb events at the Î¥ (5S) 7.5)% of Bs B s is obtained. Combining these two fs measurements and taking into account the anti-correlated systematic uncertainty due to the number of bb events, an average value fs = (18.0 Â± 1.3 Â± 3.2)% is obtained. This measurement is in good agreement with the CLEO measurement fs = tion in bb events. Similar behavior is observed for the D0 (16.0 Â± 2.6 Â± 5.8)% (Artuso et al., 2005a).173 In the Belle inclusive spectra as shown in Fig. 23.2.3(b). measurements based on 23.6 fbâ1 of data the value fs = After continuum subtraction and a bin-by-bin eï¬ciency (19.5â2.3 )% is used, which was the PDG average of all fs measurements obtained at that time.

311,2196,0.972,The Physics of the B Factories,"In this fit, the mixing parameters are defined in the form (xâ² /r0 and y â² /r0 ), where r0 is the ratio between the CF and DCS amplitudes defined above. These are allowed to vary in the fit. The time-dependent p.d.f. for this fit is convolved with a decay time resolution function derived from a fit to the RS events. The D0 lifetime is also determined from RS events, and is found to agree with the world average (Beringer et al., 2012). Signal samples consisting of 658, 986 RS (purity 99%) and 3, 009 WS (purity 50%) candidates are selected. Major sources of background come from a variety of wrongly reconstructed D0 decays, wrongly associated slow pions or from a combination of both. In the WS sample, a small background also comes from events in which both K + and Ï â are mis-identified in the PID detectors. Simulated samples of these categories are used to determine the contributions of each in the data. The shape of background events in the RS and WS Dalitz plots are determined from M and Îm sideband regions in the data. For both the RS and WS fits, eï¬ciency variations over the Dalitz plot are estimated from MC samples generated uniformly over the phase space. The Dalitz plots for the RS and WS samples, together with the distributions of M and Îm for the WS sample are shown in Fig. 19.2.19. In each of the Dalitz plots, bands due to charged and neutral states for K â (890) and for charged Ï are easily seen. CF modes preferentially decay via K â Ï while DCS modes preferentially decay via KÏ amplitudes. Values for xâ² and y â² are obtained for the combined D0 and D0 samples. Separate values are also obtained from fits to each of the two subsamples (for the latter see more details in Section 19.2.7). In all cases, a value for r0 is required. This is derived from the ratio NWS /NRS , where NWS (NRS ) is the number of wrong-sign (right-sign) signal events observed and their respective time-integrated p.d.f.s. This procedure introduces a correlation between the xâ² and y â² values obtained from the fit. Uncertainties in these mixing parameters are, therefore derived from the values obtained in a similar way for 106 pairs of values for (xâ² /r0 , y â² /r0 ) randomly generated in accordance with the fit covariance matrix (assuming Gaussian errors and including systematic uncertainties). The major systematic uncertainties arise from uncertainties in resonance masses and widths, and KÏ S-wave parameters in the decay amplitude models, variations in the estimates for the numbers of WS and RS signal events and in parameters describing the time resolution.
